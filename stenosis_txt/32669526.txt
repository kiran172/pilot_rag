Title: Diagnosis and Operative Management of Carotid Endarterectomy in Patients with Twisted Carotid Bifurcation.

Abstract: Although carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an established procedure, technical modifications are required when anatomical features are unusual. The present study aimed to determine the characteristics of diagnostic features, surgical management, and outcomes of patients with a twisted carotid bifurcation (TCB). We assessed 108 consecutive patients by cervical carotid echography (CCE) and black-blood magnetic resonance imaging (BB-MRI) before they underwent 115 CEA procedures. We classified carotid bifurcation (CB) anatomy based on anteroposterior findings of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery (ECA) determined by cerebral or three-dimensional computed tomographic angiography as follows. The ICA and ECA ran laterally and medially, respectively, in Type 1, overlapped in Type 2, and the ICA and ECA ran medially and laterally, respectively, in Type 3. We also classified the patients according to whether or not they had a TCB and compared their diagnostic findings, clinical characteristics, and surgical outcomes. The numbers of patients with Types 1, 2, and 3 were 74 (64.4%), 32 (27.8%), and 9 (7.8%), respectively, and 13 (11.3%) with a TCB included four patients with Type 2 and all nine patients with Type 3. The appearance of Type 3 differed from that of the other two types on CCE and BB-MR images. After correcting the anatomical location of a TCB, surgical duration and adverse event rates did not significantly differ between patients with and without a TCB. Patients with a TCB could safely undergo CEA after correcting the ICA to the normal position.
