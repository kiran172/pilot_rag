Title: Reoperation after failure of mitral valve repair for degenerative disease: A single surgeon experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: With an increasing number of patients undergoing mitral valve repair, more patients are presenting for reoperation. This study aimed to evaluate factors influencing mortality and survival of patients undergoing reoperation for mitral valve surgery after previous mitral valve repair under a single surgeon.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 117 patients who underwent reoperation after previous mitral valve repair between 2010 and 2022. We aimed to identify preoperative, operative, and postoperative factors affecting outcomes. The primary outcome was overall survival, and the secondary outcomes included prolonged hospital stay and in-hospital mortality. The mean follow-up was 9.13 ± 10.36 years (median, 6.50 years).
RESULTS: Out of 117 patients, 85 underwent mitral valve replacement (MVR) and 32 underwent mitral valve repair (MVr). The mean age was 64.7 ± 12.7 years (65.5 ± 12.2 years in the MVR group and 62.7 ± 14.0 years in the MVr group), and 66 (56.4%) were men. On a standard multivariate analysis of the overall factors influencing mortality, advanced age was associated with a higher risk of overall mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], f1.03-1.12; P = .001). The urgency of surgical intervention also played a role, with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality in patients undergoing emergency reoperation (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.60-149.05; P = .02). Furthermore, the presence of mixed lesions, encompassing both mitral regurgitation and stenosis, was strongly linked to increased overall mortality (HR, 17.09; 95% CI, 4.06-71.94; P &lt; .001) and in-hospital mortality (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 15.83-1925.61; P &lt; .001). Infective endocarditis emerged as a prominent risk factor for overall mortality (HR, 992.08; 95% CI, 85.74-11,479.08; P &lt; .001) and in-hospital mortality (HR, 5.83; 95% CI, 514.81-65,932.99; P &lt; .001). Additionally, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was associated with a significantly increased risk of overall mortality (HR, 4.3; 95% CI, 1.24-14.97; P = .02).
CONCLUSIONS: Our single surgeon experience demonstrates that mitral valve reoperation after a previous repair is associated with good outcomes and survival.
