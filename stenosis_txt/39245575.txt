Title: Prevalence, Radiological, and Pathological Findings of Ossification and Calcification of the Lumbar Spinal Ligamentum Flavum: A Comparative Study with Thoracic Lesions.

Abstract: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of lumbar ligamentum flavum lesions and identify correlations between radiological and pathological findings. We conducted an observational cross-sectional study of 349 patients (lumbar: n = 296, thoracic: n = 39, lumbar and thoracic: n = 14, mean age: 69 Â± 12 years, male: 74%) who underwent posterior surgery for thoracolumbar spinal canal stenosis between January 2008 and April 2023 at our hospital.Computed tomography (CT) revealed that the prevalence of ligamentum flavum lesions defined as a high-density area with a CT value of 200 Hounsfield Unit or higher in the lumbar and thoracic spine was 47% (147/310) and 85% (45/53), respectively. CT showed that most patients had radiologically suspected ossification in the lumbar (90%) and thoracic spine (98%) than radiologically suspected calcification. Lumbar lesions were thinner than the thoracic lesions (2.5 vs 3.7 mm, p < 0.01). Pathological examinations were performed in specimens collected from 34 cases (lumbar: n = 13, thoracic: n = 21), and ossification was found in 62% (8/13) and 95% (20/21) of lumbar and thoracic lesions (p = 0.02), respectively. Lastly, ossification was confirmed pathologically in 72% (8/11) and 95% (19/20) of lumbar and thoracic lesions that showed ossification on imaging (p = 0.13), respectively. The literature review revealed that the prevalence of the lumbar ligamentum flavum lesions varied from 1.5 to 35% and the patient population was mostly asymptomatic.Collectively, we found that the prevalence of lumbar ligamentum flavum lesions in symptomatic patients was greater than previously reported. Histologically confirmed ossification was less common in lumbar lesions than in thoracic lesions.
