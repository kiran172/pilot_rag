Title: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension: an illustrated guide for the trainee radiologist.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, headache, and visual perturbations. Although the pathophysiology of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is obscure, several mechanisms have been proposed, such as increased cerebral blood volume, excessive cerebrospinal fluid volume (due to high production or impaired resorption), and inflammatory mechanisms as a likely cause of or contributor to impaired cerebrospinal fluid circulation. It predominantly affects women of reproductive age who are overweight or obese. The most common symptoms are daily headache, synchronous pulsatile tinnitus, transient visual perturbations, and papilledema with visual loss. The main neuroimaging findings are a partially empty sella turcica; flattening of the posterior sclera; transverse sinus stenosis (bilateral or in the dominant sinus); a prominent perioptic subarachnoid space, with or without optic nerve tortuosity; and intraocular protrusion of the optic nerve head. The main complication of idiopathic intracranial hypertension is visual loss. Within this context, neuroimaging is a crucial diagnostic tool, because the pathology can be reversed if properly recognized and treated early.
