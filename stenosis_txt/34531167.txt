Title: Tracheoesophageal fistula and pharyngoesophageal stenosis repair by double skin paddle radial forearm flap.

Abstract: Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) constitutes a rare, but serious complication in laryngectomized patients, usually occurring after radiotherapy. TEF may occur spontaneously or may be due to enlargement of the TEF created for placement of a voice prosthesis. Surgical treatment of TEF can be complex, especially in the presence of a concomitant pharyngoesophageal stenosis (PES), and is associated with a high failure rate. In this article, we describe the surgical reconstruction technique for TEF associated with PES using a double skin paddle fasciocutaneous radial forearm free flap. The key points of this technique consist of correct positioning of the 2 skin paddles in order to reconstruct the anterior pharyngoesophageal wall and posterior tracheal wall, as well as de-epidermization of the intermediate part of the flap, which is then placed in the tracheoesophageal space.
