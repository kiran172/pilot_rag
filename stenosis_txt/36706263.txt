Title: Operative management after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: With broadening applications of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and increasing use in intermediate- and low-risk patients, the incidence of surgical re-interventions after TAVR is growing. Transcatheter heart valves suffer from similar long-term complications as surgical heart valve prostheses that require surgical re-intervention, including endocarditis and structural valve deterioration. Catastrophic periprocedural complications - such as annular or aortic rupture requiring urgent surgical intervention - may also occur during TAVR procedures. This review summarizes the current knowledge on indications, methods, and outcomes of cardiac operations after TAVR, with a focus on how to improve results in a rapidly growing patient population.
