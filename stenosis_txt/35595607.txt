Title: Endovascular Intravascular Lithotripsy in the Treatment of Calcific Common Femoral Artery Disease: A Case Series With an 18-Month Follow-Up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) is a novel endovascular treatment for calcified common femoral artery disease (CFA). Data on midterm effectiveness for clinically driven target lesions revascularization (CD-TLR) is lacking. This study investigated CD-TLR during 18-month follow-up in patients requiring IVL for CFA disease treatment.
METHODS: In a single-center retrospective cohort study, electronic medical record of patients undergoing IVL for CFA disease from January 2018 to March 2020 were reviewed. Primary outcome was CD-TLR estimated by Kaplan-Meier method during 18-month follow-up. Univariate logistic regression was used to compare differences in CD-TLR by the type of adjunct therapy used.
RESULTS: Among 54 CFA lesions in 50 patients, mean age (SD) was 75(8) years, gender and race were predominantly male (74%, n = 37) and white (94%, n = 47), respectively. Rutherford class III claudication was most common (70%, n = 35) with mean ABI of 0.66 (0.26) and mean angiographic stenosis of 77% (13%). Adjunct use of drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty was 83% (n = 45) and atherectomy was 39% (n = 21). Residual angiographic stenosis was <30% in all cases. Complications included dissection requiring stent placement (2%, n = 1). After 18-months, 18% (n = 9) died unrelated to procedural complications and 6% (n = 3) were lost to follow-up. 18-month cumulative freedom from CD-TLR was 80.6% (95% CI: 69.1%, 92%). Univariate logistic regression did not reveal a statistically significant difference in CD-TLR with type of adjunct therapy used (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: IVL with adjunct use of DCB and/or atherectomy is safe and effective in treatment of calcified CFA disease. Randomized studies are required to confirm these findings.
