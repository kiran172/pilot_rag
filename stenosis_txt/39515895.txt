Title: Laryngotracheal Resection for Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (ISS) is a rare disorder resulting in cicatricial narrowing of the airway centered at the cricoid cartilage. It almost exclusively affects Caucasian women. Endoscopic treatments such as dilatation, laser, or local injection of agents that can decrease the inflammatory and fibrotic reaction can be effective at palliating symptoms. However, definitive treatment involves surgical correction with a laryngotracheal resection with primary reconstruction, which is associated with low recurrence rates. This article discusses the evaluation and treatment of patients with ISS, discusses surgical technical details, and brings attention to issues that might arise in the postoperative period.
