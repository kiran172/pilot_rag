Title: [Relationship between etiology and morphological classification of benign central airway stenosis and its prognosis].

Abstract: Objectives: To analyze the relationship between etiology and morphological classification of benign central airway stenosis and its prognosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective study of the medical records of 453 patients initially diagnosed with benign airway stenosis at Department of Respiratory Diseases in Beijing Tiantan Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University from January 2003 to October 2019. Of 453 patients, 260 were male. The age of the study population was 12-86(44.0Â±24.5) years. Results: Among the 453 patients diagnosed with benign central airway stenosis, 161 case (35.5%, including 113 post-tracheostomy tracheal stenosis and 48 post-intubation tracheal stenosis) were iatrogenic; 88 cases were from benign tumors (19.4%), 77 cases from tracheal or bronchial tuberculosis (17.0%), 71 case from tracheal foreign bodies (15.7%). Disease causes varied among different gender or age groups. The main type of stenosis was structural stenosis, of which 241 cases (53.2%) were intra-luminal and 183 cases (40.4%) were scar contracture type. The site of stenosis showed a certain relationship with the causes of stenosis. The stenosis degree was mainly from grade 2 to grade 4 (76.4%), and the length was mainly within 3 cm (84.8%). Single factor analysis on the relationship between disease cause, morphological classification and prognosis of benign central airway stenosis showed statistically better prognosis in groups that were caused by benign tumor, intraductal stenosis or stenosis that were 3-4 in degree and 1-2 degree in length. Conclusion: The common causes of central airway stenosis included iatrogenic stenosis, benign tumor, tracheal or bronchial tuberculosis and tracheal foreign bodies. Benign airway stenosis with different disease causes and morphological classification had different prognosis after bronchoscopic interventional treatment. Clinicians should know the disease causes, morphological characterization and risk factors for benign airway stenosis for earlier diagnosis, treatment or prevention.
