Title: Presence of any degree of coronary artery disease among liver transplant candidates is associated with increased rate of post-transplant major adverse cardiac events.

Abstract: The impact of coronary artery disease (CAD) among liver transplant candidates (LTC) on post-LT clinical outcomes remains unclear. The aim of this study is to determine association of presence and severity of CAD on post-LT major adverse cardiac events (MACE) including cardiac-associated mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of 231 patients who underwent diagnostic coronary angiogram (DCA) during their LT evaluation at a tertiary medical center from 2012-2017. Patients were analyzed based on degree of CAD (no CAD, non-obstructive CAD [< 50% stenosis], obstructive CAD [≥50% stenosis]) per DCA results. MACE were noted at 30 days, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years post-LT, and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to determine post-LT MACE-free probability. LTC with any CAD, including non-obstructive CAD, had lower MACE-free probability at all post-LT time points (0.94 vs 0.65 at 30 days, P = .001; 0.87 vs 0.59 at 1 year, P = .002; 0.87 vs 0.41 at 3 years, P < .001; 0.87 vs 0.37 at 5 years, P < .001). Identification of and medical intervention for non-obstructive CAD should be considered in all LTC, though further studies are necessary to determine optimal medical interventions to mitigate MACE risk in this cohort.
