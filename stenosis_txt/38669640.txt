Title: A Novel Model for Xenograft Right Ventricle to Pulmonary Artery Conduit.

Abstract: The last 40 years have shown dramatic improvement in outcomes for neonatal cardiac surgery for a spectrum of congenital heart disease diagnoses. With more patients surviving into adulthood, the long-term impact of initial management strategies of these patients has come into focus. This is particularly true for patients with pediatric heart valve disease. Many patients born with right ventricular to pulmonary artery (RVPA) discontinuity require placement of a valved conduit in the neonatal period. Valved conduit options are limited in this patient population due to patient size and inability to respond to somatic growth. Genetically engineered porcine (GEP) donors may offer a xenograft conduit alternative that can grow with the patient. We have developed a model utilizing GEP donor RVPA conduits placed in infantile nonhuman primate (NHP) recipients. Our recipient is maintained on single-drug immunosuppression and demonstrates no evidence of pulmonary valve insufficiency or stenosis during short-term follow-up. Further studies and long-term outcomes are necessary to determine the utility of this technology in human application.
