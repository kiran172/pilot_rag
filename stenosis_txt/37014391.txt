Title: Pelvic radiation-induced urinary strictures: etiology and management of a challenging disease.

Abstract: Radiation is a common treatment modality for pelvic malignancies. While it can be effective at cancer control, downstream effects can manifest months to years after treatment, leaving patients with significant morbidity. Within urology, a particularly difficult post-radiation consequence is urinary tract stricture, either of the urethra, bladder neck, or ureter. In this review, we will discuss the mechanism of radiation damage and treatment options for these potentially devastating urinary sequelae.
