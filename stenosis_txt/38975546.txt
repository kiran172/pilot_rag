Title: Scimitar Syndrome in Adulthood: Challenges in Management and Individualized Approaches.

Abstract: Scimitar syndrome is a congenital disorder characterized by partial anomalous pulmonary venous return to the inferior vena cava (IVC). Clinical manifestation in adulthood is infrequent. The management approach has not been universally accepted and may be challenging. Individually tailored and multidisciplinary team-based decisions are often necessary. We present the case of a symptomatic patient diagnosed with complex congenital heart disease, including scimitar syndrome and atrial septal defect at the age of 50 years. Surgical repair, involving scimitar vein implantation in the left atrium using a pericardial patch, was performed. Despite surgical correction, dyspnea persisted, and hemoptysis developed. A diagnostic workup revealed a critical stenosis of the re-inserted vein. This was successfully treated by percutaneous intervention with stent implantation. The patient has remained asymptomatic since the procedure. Scimitar syndrome can be first diagnosed in adulthood, and clinical manifestations can vary. Diagnostic workup necessitates a CT angiogram, magnetic resonance scan, and catheterization in selected cases. Stenoses of re-implanted pulmonary veins (PVs) can develop years after surgical correction, and hemoptysis may serve as a warning symptom prompting further PV imaging. Percutaneous vascular intervention using a stent is warranted in symptomatic cases and can lead to long-term success.
