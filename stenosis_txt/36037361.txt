Title: Interleukin 38 alleviates aortic valve calcification by inhibition of NLRP3.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is common in people over the age of 65. Progressive valvular calcification is a characteristic of CAVD and due to chronic inflammation in aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) resulting in CAVD progression. IL-38 is a naturally occurring anti-inflammatory cytokine; here, we report lower levels of endogenous IL-38 in AVICs isolated from patients' CAVD valves compared to AVICs from non-CAVD valves. Recombinant IL-38 suppressed spontaneous inflammatory activity and calcium deposition in cultured AVICs. In mice, knockdown of IL-38 enhanced the production of inflammatory mediators in murine AVICs exposed to the proinflammatory stimulant matrilin-2. We also observed that in cultured AVICs matrilin-2 stimulation activated the NOD-, LRR-, and pyrin domain-containing protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome with procaspase-1 cleavage into active caspase-1. The addition of IL-38 to matrilin-2-treated AVICs suppressed caspase-1 activation and reduced the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, runt-related transcription factor 2, and alkaline phosphatase. Aged IL-38-deficient mice fed a high-fat diet exhibited aortic valve lesions compared to aged wild-type mice fed the same diet. The interleukin-1 receptor 9 (IL-1R9) is the putative receptor mediating the anti-inflammatory properties of IL-38; we observed that IL-1R9-deficient mice exhibited spontaneous aortic valve thickening and greater calcium deposition in AVICs compared to wild-type mice. These data demonstrate that IL-38 suppresses spontaneous and stimulated osteogenic activity in aortic valve via inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase-1. The findings of this study suggest that IL-38 has therapeutic potential for prevention of CAVD progression.
