Title: Radiation-Induced Aortic Stenosis: An Update on Treatment Modalities.

Abstract: The adverse effects of radiation therapy for cancer are well described and can include a wide array of cardiac complications. Radiation-induced aortic stenosis (AS) is an increasingly recognized entity that poses particular therapeutic challenges. Several retrospective studies comparing the outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) vs those after surgical aortic valve replacement patients with radiation-induced AS have found a trend toward decreased mortality and fewer major complications with TAVR. Surgical aortic valve replacement is associated with increased mortality in patients with radiation-induced AS compared with patients without a history of prior radiation. TAVR has been shown to be a safe and effective alternative in patients with radiation-induced AS, with safety similar to that for patients who have not received prior radiation. However, rare and unexpected complications may occur after TAVR from the deleterious effects of radiation on mediastinal structures. More studies are needed to identify the optimal way of managing patients with radiation-induced AS, and algorithms are needed for planning these complex interventions.
