Title: Coronary artery stenosis detection via proposal-shifted spatial-temporal transformer in X-ray angiography.

Abstract: Accurate detection of coronary artery stenosis in X-ray angiography (XRA) images is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease. However, stenosis detection remains a challenging task due to complicated vascular structures, poor imaging quality, and fickle lesions. While devoted to accurate stenosis detection, most methods are inefficient in the exploitation of spatio-temporal information of XRA sequences, leading to a limited performance on the task. To overcome the problem, we propose a new stenosis detection framework based on a Transformer-based module to aggregate proposal-level spatio-temporal features. In the module, proposal-shifted spatio-temporal tokenization (PSSTT) scheme is devised to gather spatio-temporal region-of-interest (RoI) features for obtaining visual tokens within a local window. Then, the Transformer-based feature aggregation (TFA) network takes the tokens as the inputs to enhance the RoI features by learning the long-range spatio-temporal context for final stenosis prediction. The effectiveness of our method was validated by conducting qualitative and quantitative experiments on 233 XRA sequences of coronary artery. Our method achieves a high F<sub>1</sub> score of 90.88%, outperforming other 15 state-of-the-art detection methods. It demonstrates that our method can perform accurate stenosis detection from XRA images due to the strong ability to aggregate spatio-temporal features.
