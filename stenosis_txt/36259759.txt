Title: Right-parasternal approach for aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic repair after ante-thoracic route gastric tube reconstruction.

Abstract: Due to the limitations of surgical incisions and approaches brought on by the presence of gastric tube (GT), open heart surgery following ante-thoracic route GT reconstruction remains challenging. A-73-year-old man, who had a history of esophageal resection and ante-thoracic route GT reconstruction required aortic valve replacement (AVR) concomitant with ascending aortic repair (AAR) for aortic stenosis and dilated ascending aorta. We performed open heart surgery via a right-parasternal approach to avoid injury to the GT and nutrient arteries. This approach provided a good operative field, similar to median sternotomy. To our knowledge, this is the first case of AVR concomitant with AAR after ante-thoracic route GT reconstruction via a right-parasternal approach. We consider that the right-parasternal approach is reasonable for patients with ante-thoracic route GT reconstruction.
