Title: Quantitation of Renin Activity in Plasma Using Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).

Abstract: Accurate determination of plasma renin activity (PRA) is essential for the development and maintenance of an effective screening program for primary aldosteronism (PA). PRA measurement can also be useful in the investigation of renal artery stenosis, syndrome of mineralocorticoid excess, Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, Bartters and Gitelman syndromes, and for inherited defects in the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS). We describe a semiautomated and simple method for the accurate and precise measurement of PRA from 500 μL of plasma (250 μL if blank subtraction is omitted, as discussed) using a liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for angiotensin I (AngI) in 96-well format. After a 3 h AngI generation step at 37 °C in buffering conditions at pH 6, the reaction is quenched with 10% formic acid containing AngI internal standard. Sample preparation then proceeds with offline solid phase extraction, two wash steps, and methanol elution followed by injection into the LC-MS/MS system. Quantitation is performed against a 7-point calibration linear curve prepared in buffer. The assay calibration range is 0.34-30.0 ng/mL, which corresponds to PRA values of 0.11-10.0 ng/mL/h: much wider than was possible using traditional competitive antibody-based methods. Total precision in clinical production has been observed to be 5.8-5.0% for BioRad Hypertension Control materials having nominal PRA values ranging from 1.73 to 12.43 ng/mL/h. At AngI concentrations of 0.06 ng/L (corresponding to a PRA of 0.02 ng/mL/h), signal-to-noise ratio is 50:1, indicating that the limit of quantitation is well below the level required for clinical use.
