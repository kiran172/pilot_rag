Title: Superficial temporal artery access for transfemoral or transbrachial carotid artery stenting in selected patients considered unfit for carotid surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transfemoral (TFCAS) or transbrachial carotid artery stenting (TBCAS) is an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treatment of high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. A difficult aortic arch (i.e., type III or bovine arch) and/or a tortuous/stenosed common carotid artery (CCA) are potential reasons for technical failure. This study explores the benefits of superficial temporal artery access (STAA) in aiding TFCAS or TBCAS for patients with challenging anatomical conditions.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients who underwent TFCAS or TBCAS using STAA between January and November 2023 were prospectively collected. Demographics, comorbidities, clinical presentation, and imaging studies were reviewed. Primary outcomes included 30-day stroke/death and technical success. Secondary outcomes and causes of failures were assessed.
RESULTS: Ten patients (mean age: 74 [range: 66-84] years) with difficult aortic arch (N.=2), CCA tortuosity (N.=2), proximal CCA stenosis (N.=2), previous technical TFCAS failure (N.=2) and aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) (N.=2) underwent TFCAS or TBCAS supported by STAA. Successful STAA was possible in eight patients (six facilitated TFCAS and two TBCAS. after TBCAS occurred TIA). In two cases STAA was not successful. There were no deaths or strokes within 30 days, transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in one patient. Follow-up Duplex ultrasound confirmed occlusion of the STA in all patients, without clinical consequences.
CONCLUSIONS: This prospective study suggests that TFCAS/TBCAS supported by STAA is a viable and safe approach when traditional access methods are ineffective and transcarotid artery stenting in not available or not possible. Despite a 20% technical failure in the current series, this technique may be useful for challenging anatomy of the aortic arch, CCA stenosis and tortuosity, and AIOD. When feasible, STAA may be a promising adjunct to TFCAS/TBCAS.
