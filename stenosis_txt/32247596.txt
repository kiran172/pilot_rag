Title: Long-term Outcome of a Modified Piggyback Liver Transplantation Technique Using the Recipient's Right and Middle Hepatic Veins.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: In early piggyback liver transplantation (LT) descriptions, the common stump of the middle and left hepatic veins (ML) was used for upper caval anastomosis. In this variant, stenosis or kinking of graft venous outflow path was frequent. Over time, most authors adopted the use of the recipient's right, middle, and left hepatic veins (RML) or a side-to-side anastomosis (SS) between the graft's and recipient's inferior vena cava (IVC). Nonetheless, partial IVC clamping required in RML and SS can reduce IVC flow. Since 1998, we incorporated a modified piggyback procedure using the recipient's right and middle hepatic veins (RM) to simultaneously achieve better preservation of IVC flow and a wide and well-positioned anastomosis.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to describe the RM method and to compare this technique with other standard variants of piggyback LT.
METHOD: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 477 piggyback LTs classified in 4 groups: ML (n = 102); RM (n = 171); RML (n = 150); and SS (n = 54).
RESULTS: The incidence of venous outflow block was 3.9% (4/102) in ML, 2.3% (4/171) in RM, 0% (0/150) in RML, and 3.7% (2/54) in SS (P = .049). On Bonferroni multiple comparison analysis, no statistically significant paired difference was identified. Results showed that 1-, 3-, 5-, and 10-year patient survival was 76%, 67%, 63%, and 51% in the ML group; 80%, 71%, 68%, and 62% in the RM group; 77%, 75%, 70%, and 64% in the RML group; and 76%, 76%, 76%, and 70% in the SS group, respectively (P = .193).
CONCLUSION: The RM modified piggyback LT technique is feasible and safe.
