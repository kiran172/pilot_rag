Title: "Heyde's enigma" in a patient with congenital annular aortic stenosis and its therapeutic challenges.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Heyde's syndrome is described as angio-dysplastic gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in elderly patients with degenerative severe calcific aortic stenosis (AS), resulting in anaemia. It was first reported by Edward C. Heyde in 1958 and thus carried his name. Although this condition is considered to develop in 10-20% of severe AS, it is a less familiar entity in clinical practice. With the rising geriatric population in the communities, there is a proportionate increase in the incidence of AS and accompanying Heyde's syndrome. Heyde's syndrome has also been associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, left ventricular assist device, ventricular septal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus. This article reports a case of Heyde's syndrome associated with congenital annular AS, successfully treated by aortic root enlargement and valve replacement.
