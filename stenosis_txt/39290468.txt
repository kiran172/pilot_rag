Title: Enhancing long-segmental tracheal restoration: A self-repairing hydrogel loaded with chondrocytokines for sutureless anastomosis and cartilage regeneration.

Abstract: Artificial tracheal substitutes encounter significant challenges during long-segmental tracheal defects (LSTD) reconstruction, notably early postoperative anastomotic stenosis and tracheal chondromalacia. Mitigating early anastomotic stenosis by creating a compliant sutureless substitute is pivotal. Enhancing its chondrogenic capacity is equally critical for sustained healthy tracheal cartilage regeneration. This study proposes a self-healing hydrogel for sutureless tracheal anastomosis to mitigate anastomotic stenosis, enriched with kartogenin (KGN) and transforming growth factor-β1 (TGFβ1) to bolster chondrogenic properties. Initially, two precursor solutions were prepared: 1) aldehyde-modified hyaluronic acid with sulfonation and β-cyclodextrin-CHO loaded with KGN; 2) hydrazide-grafted gelatin loaded with TGFβ1. Coextrusion of these solutions resulted in a gelated G + TGFβ1/sH-CD + KGN hydrogel, characterized by a robust covalent bonding network of acylhydrazones between hydrazide and aldehyde groups, imparting excellent self-healing properties. The G + TGFβ1/sH-CD + KGN hydrogels, showcasing favorable cytocompatibility, excellent injectability, and rapid gelation, were loaded with bone marrow stem cells. These were customized into O-shaped rings and assembled into a malleable tracheal substitute using our established ring-to-tube method. This resultant compliant substitute facilitated sutureless anastomosis of LSTD in a rabbit model, attributed to the Schiff base reaction between the hydrogel's carbonyl group and the tissue's amino group. Notably, the tracheal substitute reduced early postoperative anastomotic stenosis, maintained tracheal patency, alleviated sputum blockage, promoted reepithelization, and increased the survival rate of the experimental rabbits. The sustained release of chondrocytokines resulted in excellent tracheal cartilage regeneration. Employing chondrocytokines-loaded hydrogels with self-healing properties represents a significant advancement in sutureless tracheal anastomosis and tracheal cartilage regeneration, holding promising potential in inhibiting early postoperative anastomotic stenosis and tracheal chondromalacia when treating LSTD.
