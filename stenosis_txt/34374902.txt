Title: Clinical insights into a tertiary care center cohort of patients with bicuspid aortic valve.

Abstract: Although bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases, clinical data associated with valve dysfunction are still limited. We evaluated clinical characteristics and echocardiography of French patients with BAV associated with leaking and stenosis degeneration. We initiated a prospective registry from 2014 to 2018 at a tertiary center. A total of 223 patients (168 males [75%], age 53 ± 17 years) were enrolled. Among these patients 83% had left-right coronary cusps fusion, 80% Sievers type 1 BAV and 49% showed aortic dilatation. Twenty-four patients (11%) had normal valve function, 66 patients (31%) had aortic stenosis (AS), 91 patients (41%) had aortic regurgitation (AR) and 40 patients (17%) had AR and AS. BAV phenotype did not predict neither AS nor AR (all p > 0.1). By multivariable analysis, age > 50 (41.6[10.3-248.2], p < 0.001) and presence of raphe/fusion (12.8[2.4-87.4], p < 0.001) were significantly associated with AS, whereas male gender was associated with AR (5[1.6-16.4], p = 0.005). In addition, leaking degeneration was observed at a much younger age than stenosis (44 ± 14 years vs. 66 ± 10 years, p < 0.01) and among patients with valve dysfunction younger age was independently associated with AR (1.9[1.85-1.94], p < 0.001). In this study we confirmed high prevalence of valve dysfunction at first diagnosis of BAV in a referred population. The degenerative process differs according to type of dysfunction and is mainly dependent on age and gender.
