Title: [Research progress of ion channels relating to cerebral ischemic diseases and prevention and treatment with traditional Chinese medicine].

Abstract: Cerebral ischemia is a series of clinical symptoms and signs of cerebral ischemia, hypoxia and neuronal damage caused by cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion due to atherosclerosis or thrombosis, which seriously affects human health and quality of life. Cerebral ischemia involves the cascade reaction of the &quot;neurovascular unit&quot; system, and finally affects the normal physiological function of nerve cells and produces a series of pathological changes. And the changes in the structure and function of various ion channels in the cell membrane play an important role during this process. This article illustrates the changes in the ion channel associated with ce-rebral ischemic diseases, such as the potassium ion channels, sodium ion channels, calcium channels and other relevant channels, like AQP, TRPM2, TRPM7, TRPV4, ASICs, Cl~- channel, and explores the intervention effect of traditional Chinese medicine in prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemic diseases from the perspective of ion channels, in order to provide references for potential targets involving in drug development for the future prevention and treatment of cerebral ischemic diseases.
