Title: Quality of life and frailty outcomes following surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Our objective was to report on the prospective outcomes in the areas of depression, quality of life, angina, and frailty in SAVR and TAVR patients with aortic stenosis undergoing aortic valve intervention.
METHODS: We recruited 300 patients across 3 groups (TAVR, SAVR, and CABG) over 12 months. Depression, quality of life, frailty, and angina were assessed followed by propensity score matching.
RESULTS: Using logistical regression when all patient factors considered for all patients who had SAVR and TAVR, the only preoperative factors that impacted on 1 year mortality was hypertension and STS score. Quality of life improvements within each group over 12 months was significant (p value = 0.0001). Depression at 12 months between groups (p value = 0.0395) and within each group was significant (p value = 0.0073 for SAVR and 0.0001 for TAVR). Angina was most frequent in TAVR at 12 months in the QL (p = 0.0001), PL (p = 0.0007), and improvement was significant in the QL (SAVR p = 0.0010, TAVR p = 0.0001) and PL (SAVR p = 0.0002), TAVR p = 0.0007) domains in both groups. Frailty at 12 months improved in both groups, but was greatest in TAVR (p value = 0.00126).
CONCLUSIONS: This 12 months follow up of cardiac surgical patients has revealed significant improvement in PROMs and frailty in all groups by 3 months postoperative regardless of surgical or transcatheter approach. Outcome measures of quality of life and frailty could be utilized as a measure of outcome more regularly in patients undergoing aortic valve surgery regardless of approach.
