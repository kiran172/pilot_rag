Title: [Analysis of high-risk factors for failure of autologous arteriovenous fistula in hemodialysis patients].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the high risk factors of failure of autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in hemodialysis patients.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted, patients with maintenance hemodialysis (MHD) undergoing AVF admitted to General Hospital of Western Theater Command from January 2021 to December 2022 were enrolled, including 107 patients with normal AVF and 168 patients with AVF dysfanction. According to the causes of AVF failure, the patients were divided into AVF stenosis group (n = 103) and AVF thrombosis group (n = 65). Age, gender, body mass index (BMI) and comorbidities (hypertension, diabetes, coronary heart disease) and other clinical data of all patients were collected. Hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, platelet count, C-reactive protein (CRP), high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) within 1 month of AVF use in normal dialysis patients and 1 week before AVF failure. Multivariate Logistic regression was used to analyze the independent risk factors of AVF dysfuction in MHD patients. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC curve) was drawn to evaluate the predictive value of risk factors on AVF dysfuction in MHD patients.
RESULTS: (1) There were significant differences in age, BMI, hypertension, hemoglobin, hematocrit, PLR and CRP [age (years): 56.94±14.32, 58.83±14.05, 51.57±13.19; BMI (kg/m2): 22.83±3.10, 21.27±4.98, 23.35±2.72; hypertension: 93.20%, 64.62%, 86.92%; hemoglobin (g/L): 110.82±22.16, 88.70±24.00, 87.95±23.45; hematocrit: 0.350±0.069, 0.282±0.076, 0.275±0.071; PLR: 197.35±113.59, 192.55±138.25, 162.12±73.25; CRP (mg/L): 10.01±4.02, 8.18±5.42, 3.17±1.30, all P &lt; 0.05], among AVF stenosis group, AVF thrombosis group and AVF normal group, there were statistically significant differences no statistically significant difference was found in other indexes among three groups. (2) Multivariate Logistic regression analysis showed that hypertension [odds ratio (OR) = 4.849, 95% confidence interval (95%CI) was 1.278-18.397, P = 0.020], elevated CRP levels (OR = 2.104, 95%CI was 1.533-2.888, P = 0.000) were associated with AVF stenosis. Elevated CRP levels (OR = 1.984, 95%CI was 1.442-2.730, P = 0.000) was an independent risk factor for AVF thrombosis. Analysis of ROC curve showed that the area under the curve (AUC) of AVF dysfunction predicted by CRP was 0.712, 95%CI was 0.637-0.786, P = 0.000; CRP cut-off value was 1.8 mg/L, the sensitivity was 67.0%, the specificity was 83.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated CRP is an independent risk factor for AVF failure in hemodialysis patients, which can be used to predict the occurrence of AVF failure.
