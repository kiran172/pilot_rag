Title: Single center experience with the balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter aortic valve system with the first 100 patients: 30-day and 1-year follow-up.

Abstract: AIMS: To report our single-center data, regarding the first 100 patients who underwent TAVR procedure with the new balloon-expandable MYVAL system. We report 30-day and 1-year outcomes in low to high-risk TAVR patient population.
METHODS: From November 2019 to July 2021, 100 consecutive patients underwent TAVR procedure. Patient outcome was classified according to the VARC-2 definitions. The device performance was assessed using transthoracic echocardiography. Data collection was allowed by the Local Ethical Committee.
RESULTS: The mean age was 74.7 years, 63 (63%) were male. The mean Euroscore II and STS score were 4.8 ± 4.9 and 5.6 ± 3.9, respectively. Transfemoral access was the most frequent (surgical vs. percutaneous 2% vs. 97%) and in one patient surgical subclavian access was used. VARC-2 outcomes were as follows: device success 99%, STROKE 1%, major and minor vascular complication was 1% and 11%, respectively, the rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was 30.7%. At discharge, the incidence of grade I, grade II aortic regurgitation was 39% and 1%, respectively, without relevant PVL. In-hospital mortality was only 1%. These results included a high proportion (17%) of patients with bicuspid aortic valves. At 1 year, the all-cause mortality rate was 7% (only two due to cardiac event) and only a single patient had valve-related dysfunction requiring surgical aortic replacement.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR procedure with MYVAL transcatheter heart valve system shows excellent 30-day and 1-year outcomes regarding patient survival, technical success, and valve-related adverse events. The limitations of our study comprise a single-center study with retrospective data collection.
