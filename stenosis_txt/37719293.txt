Title: Acute Presentation of Critical Aortic Stenosis, Cardiogenic Shock, and the "Heart Team" Approach to Management.

Abstract: A 65-year-old male was admitted for cardiogenic shock (ejection fraction: 15%) with severe aortic stenosis and regurgitation. He underwent emergency angiography and mechanical circulatory support. A multidisciplinary heart team discussed treatment options. Ultimately, he underwent successful emergency surgical aortic valve replacement with recovery on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
