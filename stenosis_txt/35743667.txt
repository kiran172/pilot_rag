Title: Patient-Tailored Stenting versus Endarterectomy for the Treatment of Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenosis is a major cause of acute ischemic strokes in adults. Given the consequences and sequelae of an acute ischemic stroke, intervention while patients are still asymptomatic is a key opportunity for stroke prevention. Although carotid endarterectomy has been the gold standard of treatment for carotid stenosis for many years, recent advances in carotid stenting technology, practitioner experience, and dual antiplatelet therapy have expanded the use for treatments other than endarterectomy. Review of the current literature has demonstrated that endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting produce overall similar results for the treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis, but certain factors may help guide physicians and patients in choosing one treatment over the other. Age 70 years and older, renal disease, poor medication compliance, and unstable plaque features all portend better outcomes from endarterectomy, whereas age under 70 years, high cervical location of disease, cardiac disease, and reliable medication compliance favor stenting. The decision to pursue endarterectomy versus stenting is therefore complex, and although large studies have demonstrated similar outcomes, the approach to treatment of asymptomatic carotid stenosis must be optimized for each individual patient to achieve the best possible outcome.
