Title: [Two Cases of Esophagogastric Junction Cancer after Subtotal Stomach-Preserving Pancreaticoduodenectomy].

Abstract: We report 2 cases with esophagogastric junction(EGJ)cancer who underwent remnant gastrectomy preserving Braun anastomosis after subtotal stomach-preserving pancreaticoduodenectomy(SSPPD)with modified Child's reconstruction. In case 1, a 73-year-old man was diagnosed with EGJ cancer 4 years after SSPPD for stenosis of lower bile duct. He underwent remnant gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y(R-Y)reconstruction preserving Braun anastomosis using linear stapler(overlap method). In case 2, a 77-year-old man, who underwent SSPPD for intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm 1 year ago, was performed endoscopic submucosal dissection for EGJ cancer and planned additional gastrectomy, because of non-curative resection. He was performed remnant gastrectomy with R-Y reconstruction preserving Braun anastomosis using circular stapler. In both patients, the postoperative courses were favorable without complication. Remnant gastrectomy after PD is difficult because of anatomical changes due to adhesions and gastrointestinal reconstruction. R-Y reconstruction preserving Braun anastomosis may be a useful surgical procedure for remnant gastric cancer after SSPPD.
