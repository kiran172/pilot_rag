Title: Investigator-initiated clinical trial of stabilizer device: A novel intracranial exchange guidewire for neuroendovascular treatments.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neuroendovascular procedures, especially those involving significant vessel tortuosity, giant intracranial aneurysms, or distally located lesions, frequently necessitate exchange methods. However, exchange maneuvers pose a risk of inadvertent vessel injury. To address these challenges, a Stabilizer device was developed and evaluated for its efficacy and safety. This clinical trial aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the Stabilizer device in facilitating the navigation of neuroendovascular devices to target lesions in cases where the exchange technique was necessary.
METHODS: This was a single-arm, prospective, open-label, multicenter clinical trial performed at nine different sites. It focused on investigating the use of the Stabilizer device for treating intracranial aneurysms and atherosclerosis.
RESULTS: A total of 31 patients were enrolled across nine centers in Japan from July 21, 2022, to March 10, 2023. The study enrolled 24 (77.4%) patients with intracranial aneurysms and seven (22.6%) patients with intracranial artery stenosis. Majority of the target lesions were in the middle cerebral artery territory (83.9%). The Stabilizer device was used to exchange for 0.027-inch catheters, intermediate catheters, PTA balloons, and Wingspan stent system. The Stabilizer device demonstrated 100% technical success rate. While three complications related to the treatment were noted, there were no complications related to the device, including any vascular damage.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first multicenter clinical trial that investigated and demonstrated technical efficacy as well as overall safety profile of the Stabilizer device in neuroendovascular procedures where the use of an exchange method was necessary.
