Title: Disproportionately high aortic valve calcium scores in atrial fibrillation: implications for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: AIMS: Doppler mean gradient (MG) can underestimate aortic stenosis (AS) severity in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) compared with patients with sinus rhythm (SR), potentially delaying intervention in AF. This study compared outcomes in patients with AF and SR following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and investigated delay in TAVR based on computed tomography aortic valve calcium score (AVCS).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients who underwent TAVR from 2013 to 2017 for native valve severe AS were identified from an institutional database. Baseline characteristics and overall survival were compared between those with SR and AF. There were 820 patients (mean age 81 years; 41.6% females) included in this study. AF was present in 356 patients. Patients with AF were older (82.2 vs. 80.5, P = 0.003) and had a lower MG compared with patients with SR (42.0 vs. 44.9, P = 0.002) with similar indexed aortic valve area (0.4 vs. 0.4, P = 0.17). Median AVCS was higher in AF (males: AF 2850.0 vs. SR 2561.0, P = 0.044; females: AF 1942.0 vs. SR 1610.5, P = 0.025). Projected AVCS, assuming the same age of diagnosis, was similar between AF and SR. Median survival post-TAVR was worse in AF compared with SR (3.2 vs. 5.4 years, log rank P < 0.001). AF, lower MG, higher right ventricular systolic pressure, dialysis, diabetes, and significant tricuspid regurgitation were associated with higher mortality (P < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: Older age and higher AVCS in patients with AF compared with those with SR suggest that AS was both underestimated and more advanced at TAVR referral.
