Title: TAVI Between a Rock and a Hard Place in a Transplanted Heart.

Abstract: We describe a 61-year-old male patient at our institution who was being reviewed by the heart team for consideration of transcatheter aortic valve intervention. Gated cardiac computed tomography revealed extensive eccentric calcification of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) extending into the mitral valve leaflet and a large aortic annulus (33 mm; mean annular diameter/area, 854 mmsup2;). This is larger than all recommended manufacturer annular size limits, although observational data support the use of both Edwards Sapien 3 and Medtronic Evolut R in such annuli.
