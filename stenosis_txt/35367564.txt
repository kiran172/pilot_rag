Title: Transcarotid artery revascularization is associated with similar outcomes to carotid endarterectomy regardless of patient risk status.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS), including both transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS) and transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), reimbursement has been limited to high-risk patients by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) since 2005. We aimed to assess the association of CMS high-risk status with perioperative outcomes for carotid endarterectomy (CEA), TFCAS, and TCAR.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of all Vascular Quality Initiative patients who underwent carotid revascularization between 2015 and 2020. Patients were stratified by whether they met CMS CAS criteria, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the association of procedure type (CEA, TFCAS, TCAR) with perioperative outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 124,531 individuals who underwent carotid revascularization procedures, 91,687 (73.6%) underwent CEA, 17,247 (13.9%) underwent TFCAS, and 15,597 (12.5%) underwent TCAR. Among patients who met the CMS CAS criteria (ie, high-risk patients), the incidence of perioperative stroke was 2.7% for CEA, 3.4% for TFCAS, and 2.4% for TCAR (P < .001). Among standard-risk patients, the incidence of perioperative stroke was 1.7% for CEA, 2.7% for TFCAS, and 1.8% for TCAR (P < .001). After adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, the odds of perioperative stroke were lower for TCAR versus CEA in high-risk patients (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.99) and similar in standard-risk patients (aOR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.84, 1.31). In contrast, the adjusted odds of perioperative stroke were higher for TFCAS versus CEA in high-risk patients (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.03-1.46) and standard-risk patients (aOR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.37-1.86). In both populations, TFCAS and TCAR patients had significantly lower odds of myocardial infarction than CEA patients (both P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: The perioperative risks associated with CEA, TFCAS, and TCAR in high-risk patients support the current CMS criteria, although the risks associated with each revascularization approach in standard-risk patients suggest that distinguishing TCAR from TFCAS may be warranted.
