Title: Giant cell arteritis.

Abstract: Giant cell arteritis (GCA, also known as temporal arteritis) is classified as a vasculitis of large and medium sized vessels and can involve the cranial vessels as well as the aorta and great vessels. It is a systemic rheumatic disease that virtually never occurs in adults younger than 50Â years of age. GCA is the most common idiopathic systemic vasculitis. Systemic symptoms are common and involvement of the muscular, extracranial branches off of the carotid arteries are what result in the classic manifestations of cranial GCA. The disease can also be generalized involving the aorta and its branches leading to aneurysms and stenosis of involved vessels. Glucocorticoids have been the longstanding treatment option for GCA but relatively recent studies have proven additional agents like Tocilizumab are effective steroid sparing agents. GCA is a disease that is of variable duration and length of treatment differs from patient to patient. This article will review the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, work up and treatment options for GCA.
