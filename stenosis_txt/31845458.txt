Title: Balloon dilatation for paediatric airway stenosis: Evidence from the UK Airway Intervention Registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy in routine clinical practice of balloon dilatation procedures in the treatment of paediatric airway stenosis.
DESIGN: Observational data collection in prospective online research database.
SETTING: Acute NHS Trusts with ENT department undertaking complex paediatric airway work.
PARTICIPANTS: Children (<18) undergoing balloon dilatation treatment for airway stenosis.
MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Airway diameter, complications, hospital resource usage.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients had 133 balloon procedures during 128 visits to 10 hospitals. Sixty-nine (52%) of balloon procedures were conducted with a tracheostomy. Intra-operative Cotton-Myer grade decreased in 43 (57%). The mean pre-balloon subglottic diameter was 4.2 [95% CI: 3.8 to 4.5] mm, and its rate of increase was 0.8 [0.5 to 1.2] mm per year modelled on 30 patients' long-term data. As the primary treatment of stenosis, the procedural success rate of balloon dilatation (n = 52) was 65% (22% with tracheostomy, 88% without tracheostomy), and 71% as an adjunct to open reconstructive surgery (n = 7). In the 64 hospital visits where a balloon procedure was conducted with a tracheostomy in place, only one in-hospital complication (lower respiratory tract infection) occurred. For those without a tracheostomy in place, in-hospital complications occurred in seven of 64 balloon hospital visits, all related to ongoing or worsening stenosis. Six out-of-hospital complications were deemed related to ongoing or worsening stenosis following the procedure, and two complications were a combination of lower respiratory infection and ongoing or worsening stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Balloon dilation increases the size of the airway intraoperatively and is associated with long-term increase in airway diameter. Safety outcomes mostly relate to ongoing or worsening stenosis and are more common in patients without a tracheostomy.
