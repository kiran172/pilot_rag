Title: How I do it? Interlaminar contralateral endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy assisted with the O-arm navigation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The interlaminar contralateral endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy (ICELF) provides access to the foraminal pathology with less violation to facet than the ipsilateral approach. However, it is technically challenging even for an experienced surgeon.
METHODS: We introduce the step-by-step workflow of the interlaminar contralateral endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy assisted with O-arm navigation system.
CONCLUSION: The ICELF assisted with O-arm navigation is safe, accurate, and efficient for the treatment of lumbar foraminal stenosis. The CT-based navigation reshapes the learning curve of the advanced endoscopic technique, reducing the risk of facet joint violation, and minimizes radiation exposure to surgeons.
