Title: [Targeted use of comprehensive geriatric assessment tools in cardiology. Part II (literature review).].

Abstract: This review presents a targeted examination of the application of comprehensive geriatric assessment tools across various cardiovascular pathologies, including acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, acute and chronic heart failure, and aortic stenosis. It has been demonstrated that assessing patient frailty in cardiovascular pathology is crucial for determining both short-term and long-term prognosis, as well as for evaluating the risk of various complications during cardiac surgical interventions. Currently, there is active research into necessary measures aimed at improving outcomes in frail elderly patients with cardiovascular diseases, such as interdisciplinary rehabilitation and geriatric approaches. Frail patients with cardiovascular diseases should be considered as requiring a personalized approach in the provision of cardiological care, with a deep understanding of geriatric issues in the elderly, to reduce complications and improve prognosis.
