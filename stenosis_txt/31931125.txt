Title: AngioJet Aspiration Thrombectomy Combined with Transcatheter Thrombolysis in Treatment of Acute Portal Venous Systemic Thrombosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study set out to assess the feasibility, effectiveness, and safety of percutaneous AngioJet aspiration thrombectomy combined with transcatheter thrombolysis for treating acute portal venous systemic thrombosis (APVST).
METHODS: Clinical data of 13 patients with APVST who were treated by AngioJet aspiration thrombectomy combined with transcatheter thrombolysis from March 2017 to July 2018 were analyzed retrospectively. The effect of portal venous recanalization was evaluated by intraoperative angiography and postoperative surveillance of clinical findings, portal venous ultrasound, or computed tomography.
RESULTS: Successful puncture of the portal vein (PV) was performed in all patients. The PV was punctured successfully in 7 patients via the transjugular intrahepatic route, 2 patients failed to be punctured and then had successful percutaneous transhepatic puncture, and 4 patients underwent percutaneous transhepatic PV puncture directly. The duration of thrombus aspiration was 238.46 ± 89.89 sec (range, 120-360), and the amount of urokinase in thrombus aspiration was 353,000 ± 87,700 IU (range, 200,000-400,000). Portal venous thrombosis was dissolved by the AngioJet thrombectomy device (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) in all patients. After aspiration, angiography showed that grade III lysis was achieved in 8 patients, grade II lysis in 1 patient, and grade I lysis in 4 patients. The length of transcatheter thrombolysis was 3.07 ± 1.75 days (range, 1-7), and the total urokinase dose via an indwelling catheter was 1,230,000 ± 706,000 IU (range, 200,000-2,800,000). Four patients had a transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt, 1 patient with stenosis of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) achieved balloon angioplasty, and 1 patient with stenosis of the SMV was stented. Operative complications were transient hematuria (4 patients), palpitation (1 patient), and bowel resection (1 patient). No patients died within 30 days. Patients were discharged at 12.00 ± 5.83 days (range, 6-27) after admission. All patients survived, and no recurrence developed during the follow-up of 9.15 ± 3.18 months (range, 4-15).
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous AngioJet aspiration thrombectomy combined with thrombolytic therapy is feasible and effective for APVST. This treatment is beneficial for APVST in dissolving thrombus, improving SMV flow, and relieving symptoms of PV hypertension.
