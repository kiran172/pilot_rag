Title: Surgical Outcomes of Extensive Dome-Like Laminoplasty Using En Bloc Resection of C2 Inner Lamina for Patients With Severe Cord Compression Behind C2 Body.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective, single-center study.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a newly developed extensive dome-like laminoplasty using en bloc resection of the C2 inner lamina in patients with severe cord compression behind the C2 body.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: A surgery for severe cord compression behind C2 body is challenging for spinal surgeons. To date, there has been no established solution for severe cord compression behind the C2 body.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with severe cord compression behind the C2 body who underwent posterior surgery consecutively were enrolled. Extensive dome-like laminoplasty that was newly developed was performed to remove en bloc removal of the C2 inner lamina were performed. Preoperative and postoperative canal diameters behind the C2 and mean removed area of the C2 inner lamina were measured using MRI and CT scan. Clinical and radiographic parameters were assessed preoperative and postoperative periods. In addition, perioperative complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients underwent extensive dome-like laminoplasty and their diagnoses were ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL, 66.7%) and congenital stenosis with spondylosis (33.3%). The mean canal diameter behind the C2 increased from 9.85 (2.28) mm preoperatively to 19.91 (3.93) mm at the last follow-up ( P <0.001). Clinically, neck and arm visual analog scale, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, and neck disability index significantly improved at postoperative 1 month ( P <0.05), and the scores were maintained until the last follow-up. No meaningful radiographic changes occurred after the surgeries. During the procedures, there were no particular complications, but one patient showed deteriorated myelopathic symptoms and underwent additional C1-C2 decompressive surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: After extensive dome-like laminoplasty, surgical outcomes are satisfactory, and complications are rare. This technique may be a viable option for patients with severe cord compression behind the C2 body.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV.
