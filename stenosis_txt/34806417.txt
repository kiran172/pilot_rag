Title: Circulating miR-27b as a Biomarker of the Development and Progression of Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: A close relationship of microRNAs (miRNAs) with various human diseases has been widely reported, including cardiovascular disease. The current study attempted to examine the abnormal expression of miR-27b in asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis (ACAS), its diagnostic value and predictive value for the development of ACAS were also assessed.
METHODS: Clinical serum samples were collected from both ACAS patients and healthy individuals, and levels of miR-27b in the clinical samples were detected using Real-time quantitative PCR. Cerebral ischemia events (CIEs) of patients during the 5-year follow-up were collected. The diagnostic and predictive values of serum miR-27b was assessed via plotting Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier curves. Multivariate cox regression analysis was performed for clinical independent index analysis.
RESULTS: ACAS patients had higher levels of miR-27b than the healthy subjects. There were close association of serum miR-27b levels with total cholesterol (TC) level, absence of hypertension and degree of carotid stenosis. High levels of miR-27b could differentiate ACAS cases from healthy subjects, and predicted the high incidence of CIEs. MiR-27b could be used as an independent predictor of cerebrovascular events via multiple Cox regression analysis (P = .031).
CONCLUSION: The high level of miR-27b can predict the occurrence of ACAS, and is closely related to the subsequent occurrence of CIEs. The present results provide evidence for circulating miR-27b as a diagnostic and prognostic marker in patients with ACAS.
