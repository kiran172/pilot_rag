Title: Mid-term Results of Endovascular Reconstruction of Aortic Bifurcation Using COVERA Stent Graft.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This article aims to evaluate the short-term and mid-term performance of a self-expanding covered stent (COVERA Plus, Bard Tempe, Arizona) during the treatment of Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASC) C/D aortoiliac obstructive lesions involving the aortic bifurcation.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective review of all patients who underwent endovascular reconstruction of the aortoiliac bifurcation for obstructive disease, with the use of Covera, from January 2018 to March 2023. All patients received a postoperative CTA (computed tomography angiography) scan within 1 month from the intervention. Precision of deployment, stent conformation, and stent symmetry were evaluated at the arterial phase of the CTA. Early outcomes were technical success and freedom from open aortic reintervention and/or mortality. Late outcomes were primary and assisted primary patency rates and freedom from reintervention.
RESULTS: During the study period, 35 patients underwent primary endovascular treatment of obstructive lesions involving the aortic bifurcation with parallel COVERA stents. Aortoiliac lesions were classified as TASC-IIC in 23 (65.7%) patients and TASC D in 12 (34.2%). Median follow-up was 49 months (interquartile [IQR]: 18-60). Overall survival was 97.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]=91-100) at 60 months. During follow-up, there were one early stent stenosis, treated with an angioplasty and stent relining with an estimated primary patency at 60 months of 97.1% (95% CI=94-100) and a primary-assisted patency of 100%. Estimated freedom from all types of reinterventions at 60 months was 94.3% (95% CI=89-99.3).
CONCLUSIONS: The new self-expanding covered Bard COVERA Plus stent used for endovascular treatment of TASC C/D aorto iliac disease proved to be safe and feasible with high technical procedural success rates. Comparison with other types of stents is necessary to further assess the role of the COVERA Plus stent in aortic bifurcation repair.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This study investigates the safety and feasibility of the new self-expanding covered Bard Covera Plus stent used for endovascular treatment of TASC C/D aorto iliac disease. The retrospective analysis of 35 patients highlights high technical success and primary patency rate at 60 months. The geometric analysis also helped to underline how this stent can be used precisely in particular conditions. These findings suggest the need for further research to compare COVERA with other types of stents in aortic bifurcation repair.
