Title: Journey Toward Improved Long-Term Outcomes After Norwood-Sano Procedure: Focus on the Aortic Arch Reconstruction.

Abstract: The disadvantage of right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery (RV-PA) shunt is the need for more unplanned interventions to address stenosis in the shunt or branch pulmonary arteries, as compared to the modified Blalock-Taussig shunt group. Ring-enforced RV-PA PTFE conduit and dunk technique minimized these complications and right ventricle (RV) damage. Aortic arch obstruction increases afterload and leads to ventricular dysfunction and tricuspid regurgitation; therefore, most surgeons prefer to use homograft, autologous pericardium, or bovine pericardium to reconstruct the neoaorta. Artificial materials decrease the elastic properties, increase wall stiffness, and decrease the distensibility of the aorta; and as a result, RV function gradually deteriorates. This inelastic reconstructed aorta may be one of the reasons why long-term outcomes after the Fontan procedure are worse in hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) patients, in comparison to non-HLHS. Reconstruction of the neoaorta without any patch materials, or at least techniques that largely minimize the use of non-autologous materials, will offer a further refinement of our ability to optimize ventriculoarterial coupling and thereby long-term RV function.
