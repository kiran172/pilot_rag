Title: Operative techniques and long-term outcomes of hypospadias repair in the absence of preputial skin after neonatal circumcision.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To present the results of hypospadias repair in the absence of preputial skin following neonatal circumcision, and the analyses of surgical techniques and predictors of procedural success.
METHODS: Records of all children who underwent hypospadias repair between 10/1999 and 12/2018 were retrospectively reviewed. All of those who underwent neonatal circumcision prior to surgery were included. Patients with any prior penile reconstruction surgery and those with the megameatus intact prepuce variant were excluded. The primary endpoint was the need for reoperation.
RESULTS: A total of 69 patients with a history of neonatal circumcision underwent surgical reconstruction of hypospadias during the study period. Their mean age at surgery was 14 months (interquartile range [IQR] 9,22). Forty-five cases (65%) involved distal hypospadias, and ventral curvature was present in 24 (35%). Dartos flaps were harvested from the dorsal aspect in 37/58 (64%) patients and from the ventral aspect in 21/58 (36%). Twenty-two patients (22/69, 32%) required reoperation after a median follow-up of 9 years (IQR 6,13). Indications for revision surgery included urethral fistula (n = 16, 22%), meatal stenosis (n = 5, 7%), and skin redundancy (n = 1). Ventral curvature (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, p = 0.02) and higher grades of hypospadias. (OR 3.3, p = 0.03) had a higher probability of reoperation (univariate logistic regression).
CONCLUSION: Hypospadias repair following neonatal circumcision in the absence of preputial skin is a challenging reconstruction. The reoperation rate in our cohort was 30%, similar to reoperative hypospadias surgery. Parents of newborns diagnosed with hypospadias should be encouraged to refrain from pre surgical neonatal circumcision.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Treatment study, level IV.
