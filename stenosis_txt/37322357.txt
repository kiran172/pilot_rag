Title: Unravelling the pathogenesis of foramen magnum stenosis in patients with severe achondroplasia: a CT-based comparison with age-matched controls and FGFR3 craniosynostosis syndromes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Foramen magnum(FM) stenosis can be responsible for acute and chronic damage to the cervicomedullary junction in children with achondroplasia. The bony anatomy and patterns of suture fusion of the FM in this context are incompletely understood, yet becoming increasingly important in the light of novel medical therapies for achondroplasia. The objective of this study was to describe and quantify bony anatomy and fusion patterns of FM stenosis in patients with achondroplasia using CT scans, comparing them to age-matched controls and other FGFR3 craniosynostosis patients.
METHODS: Patients with achondroplasia and severe FM stenosis, classified as achondroplasia foramen magnum score(AFMS) grades 3 and 4, were identified from a departmental operative database. All had pre-operative CT scans of the craniocervical junction. Measurements obtained comprised sagittal diameter (SD), transverse diameter (TD), foramen magnum area, and opisthion thickness. Anterior and posterior interoccipital synchondroses (AIOS and PIOS) were graded by the extent of fusion. These measurements were then compared with CT scans from 3 age-matched groups: the normal control group, children with Muenke syndrome, and children with Crouzon syndrome with acanthosis nigricans (CSAN).
RESULTS: CT scans were reviewed in 23 cases of patients with achondroplasia, 23 normal controls, 20 Muenke, and 15 CSAN. Children with achondroplasia had significantly smaller sagittal diameter (mean 16.2 ± 2.4 mm) compared to other groups (control 31.7 ± 2.4 mm, p < 0.0001; Muenke 31.7 ± 3.5 mm, p < 0.0001; and CSAN 23.1 ± 3.4 mm, p < 0.0001) and transverse diameters (mean 14.3 ± 1.8 mm) compared with other groups (control 26.5 ± 3.2 mm, p < 0.0001; Muenke 24.1 ± 2.6 mm, p < 0.0001; CSAN 19.1 ± 2.6 mm, p < 0.0001). This translated into a surface area which was 3.4 times smaller in the achondroplasia group compared with the control group. The median grade of the AIOS fusion achondroplasia group was 3.0 (IQR 3.0-5.0), which was significantly higher compared with the control group (1.0, IQR 1.0-1.0, p < 0.0001), Muenke group (1.0, IQR 1.0-1.0, p < 0.0001), and CSAN (2.0, IQR 1.0-2.0, p < 0.0002). Median PIOS fusion grade was also highest in the achondroplasia group (5.0, IQR 4.0-5.0) compared with control (1.0, IQR 1.0-1.0, p < 0.0001), Muenke (2.5, IQR 1.3-3.0, p < 0.0001), and CSAN (4.0, IQR 4.0-4.0, p = 0.2). Distinct bony opisthion spurs projecting into the foramen magnum were seen in achondroplasia patients but not others, resulting in characteristic crescent and cloverleaf shapes.
CONCLUSION: Patients with AFMS stages 3 and 4 have significantly reduced FM diameters, with surface area 3.4 times smaller than age-matched controls. This is associated with premature fusion of the AIOS and PIOS in comparison with controls and other FGFR3-related conditions. The presence of thickened opisthion bony spurs contributes to stenosis in achondroplasia. Understanding and quantifying bony changes at the FM of patients with achondroplasia will be important in the future quantitative evaluation of emerging medical therapies.
