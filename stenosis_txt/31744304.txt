Title: Self-expanding segmental radioactive metal stents for palliation of malignant esophageal strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Traditional metal stents are not always suitable for patients with circuitous malignant esophageal stricture.
PURPOSE: We aimed to report the safety and effectiveness of stent insertion using self-expanding segmental radioactive metal stent in the palliation of malignant esophageal stricture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 22 consecutive patients who underwent insertion of segmental radioactive metal stents from November 2016 to March 2019. Technical success, dysphagia score, and complications were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyze the survival time.
RESULTS: The stenting procedure was successful in all 22 patients with no procedure-related deaths. Twenty-four segmental radioactive metal stents were successfully implanted. A total of 6 (27.3%) complications were found, mainly 5 (22.7%) stent migrations. The median follow-up period was 3.3 months. Stent removal was required in 4 (12.5%) patients due to complete stent migration. The mean dysphagia score decreased significantly after stent insertion (P&lt;0.0001). During follow up, 13 patients survived with no obvious clinical symptom and nine patients died. The mean survival was 9.9 months.
CONCLUSION: The stenting procedure using self-expanding segmental radioactive metal stents is safe and effective in dysphagia palliation of malignant esophageal stricture.
