Title: Stent intervention for children with CHD and tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: CHD is closely related to respiratory system diseases (Mok Q, Front Pediatr 2017; 5: 2296-2360). Flexible fibreoptic bronchoscopy will diagnose anatomical lesions of the trachea and perform interventions at the same time for children with indications. We report a case of pulmonary artery sling with severe tracheostenosis in a 11-month-old boy. Tracheal stents were placed with good prognosis.
