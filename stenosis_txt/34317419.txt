Title: Resolution of Hypoxia and Ascites With Percutaneous Intervention of Mustard Baffle Obstruction and Leak.

Abstract: A 45-year-old man with history of Mustard repair for transposition of the great arteries, cirrhosis, and chronic hypoxemic respiratory failure presented for subacute worsening of his chronic symptoms, which were found to be secondary to a previously unrecognized baffle stenosis and leak. Percutaneous intervention resolved his ascites and hypoxia. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
