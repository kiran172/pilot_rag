Title: Estimating perioperative outcomes after pediatric laryngotracheal reconstruction surgery in accordance with ACS-NSQIP-P reporting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric (ACS-NSQIP-P) database monitors quality outcomes in pediatric surgery. However, the registry might underreport low-volume procedures. This review describes complications after laryngotracheal reconstruction (LTR) based on ACS-NSQIP-P reporting standards.
METHODS: A case series with chart review at a tertiary children's hospital included consecutive LTR procedures between 2010 and 2018. Surgical procedures were grouped into single- or double-stage for comparison of thirty-day complication rates.
RESULTS: Eighty-four procedures were reviewed with 70% (59/84) double-stage and 30% (25/84) single-stage. Children requiring double-stage procedures were younger (3.3 vs. 6.0 years, P = .002) and more often Black or African American (51% vs. 24%, P = .03). Double-stage LTR was frequently performed on children with grade 3 or 4 subglottic stenosis (90% vs. 52%, P < 001), with a tracheostomy (97% vs. 68%, P = .001) and with gastroesophageal reflux disease (93% vs. 67%, P = .004). Airway-related complications occurred in 19% (16/84) of children and non-airway complications occurred in 16% (13/84) with similar rates between groups. Unplanned reintubation (20% vs. 0%, P = .002), ventilator support longer than 48 hours (12% vs. 0%, P = .02), and total hospitalization lengths (15.6 vs. 6.5 days, P < .001) were increased after single-stage LTR. Children with non-airway complications had more central nervous system disorders (46% vs. 10%, P = .004).
CONCLUSION: Postoperative complications after pediatric LTR occur in nearly 20% of children and single-stage procedures have higher unplanned reintubations, prolonged ventilator support and hospitalization lengths. Surgeons should recognize that these typically minor events should be consistently monitored and reported after surgical expansion of the pediatric airway.
