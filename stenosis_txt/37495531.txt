Title: Recurrent Stroke with Rapid Development of Intracranial Artery Stenosis and Subsequent Successful Mechanical Thrombectomy in Essential Thrombocythemia.

Abstract: Essential thrombocythemia is a myeloproliferative neoplasm. Ischemic stroke is frequently the first manifestation of essential thrombocythemia. We herein report a patient with JAK2V617 mutation-positive essential thrombocythemia who developed recurrent ischemic stroke with rapid development of intracranial artery stenosis and subsequently underwent successful mechanical thrombectomy. The high JAK2V617F allele burden in our patient (58.4%) may have affected the patient's condition. We discuss similar reports in the literature and the possible pathophysiologic mechanism of large artery involvement in these patients.
