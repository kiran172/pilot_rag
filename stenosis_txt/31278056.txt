Title: Non-Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Approach is Associated with a Higher Risk of New-Onset Atrial Fibrillation: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a frequent arrhythmic complication following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Choice of access routes for TAVR could be a factor that determines the risk of NOAF although the data is still not well-characterised. We aimed to assess the association between different access routes for TAVR (transfemoral versus non-transfemoral) and the risk of NOAF.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature review was performed through September 2018 using EMBASE and Medline. Eligible studies must compare the incidence of NOAF in patients without pre-existing atrial fibrillation who underwent TAVR. Relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were extracted from each study and combined together using the random-effects model, generic inverse variance method of DerSimonian and Laird.
RESULTS: Seven (7) retrospective studies with 18,425 patients who underwent TAVR (12,744 with the transfemoral approach and 5,681 with the non-transfemoral approach) met the eligibility criteria. After the procedures, 2,205 (12.0%) patients developed NOAF (656 [5.1%] patients in the transfemoral group and 1,549 [27.3%] patients in the non-transfemoral group). There was a significant association between the non-transfemoral approach and an increased risk of NOAF with the pooled RR of 2.94 (95%CI, 2.53-3.41; p &lt; 0.00001). Subgroup analysis showed the highest risk of NOAF in the transapical subgroup with the pooled RR of 3.20 (95% CI, 2.69-3.80; I2 33%).
CONCLUSIONS: A significantly increased risk of NOAF following TAVR among those who underwent a non-transfemoral approach compared with transfemoral approach was observed in this meta-analysis.
