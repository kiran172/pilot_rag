Title: Targeting Uremic Toxins to Prevent Peripheral Vascular Complications in Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abstract: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibits progressive kidney dysfunction and leads to disturbed homeostasis, including accumulation of uremic toxins, activated renin-angiotensin system, and increased oxidative stress and proinflammatory cytokines. Patients with CKD are prone to developing the peripheral vascular disease (PVD), leading to poorer outcomes than those without CKD. Cumulative evidence has showed that the synergy of uremic milieu and PVD could exaggerate vascular complications such as limb ischemia, amputation, stenosis, or thrombosis of a dialysis vascular access, and increase mortality risk. The role of uremic toxins in the pathogenesis of vascular dysfunction in CKD has been investigated. Moreover, growing evidence has shown the promising role of uremic toxins as a therapeutic target for PVD in CKD. This review focused on uremic toxins in the pathophysiology, in vitro and animal models, and current novel clinical approaches in reducing the uremic toxin to prevent peripheral vascular complications in CKD patients.
