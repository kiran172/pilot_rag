Title: Mechanisms of fibrosis in iatrogenic laryngotracheal stenosis: New discoveries and novel targets.

Abstract: Iatrogenic laryngotracheal stenosis (iLTS) is a pathological condition characterized by the narrowing of the laryngeal and tracheal structures due to the formation of abnormal scar tissue. The core of iLTS lies in the fibrosis of the laryngotracheal tissue, and recent research has unveiled novel discoveries regarding the underlying mechanisms of fibrosis. This review provides an overview of the recent advancements in understanding the mechanisms of fibrosis in iLTS. It encompasses various aspects, such as immune system dysregulation, changes in the extracellular matrix (ECM), metabolic alterations, and the role of microbial flora. The review also explores the interplay and relationships between these new mechanisms, establishing a theoretical foundation for the development of multi-target therapies and combination therapies for iLTS.
