Title: Rheumatic and Degenerative Mitral Stenosis: From an Iconic Clinical Case to the Literature Review.

Abstract: Mitral stenosis (MS) poses significant challenges in diagnosis and management due to its varied etiologies, such as rheumatic mitral stenosis (RMS) and degenerative mitral stenosis (DMS). While rheumatic fever-induced RMS has declined in prevalence, DMS is rising with aging populations and comorbidities. Starting from a complex clinical case of DMS, the aim of this paper is to review the literature on mitral stenosis by analyzing the available tools and the differences in terms of diagnosis and treatment for rheumatic and degenerative stenosis. Emerging transcatheter techniques, such as transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) and lithotripsy-facilitated percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC), represent promising alternatives for DMS patients deemed unfit for surgery. In particular, intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has shown potential in facilitating percutaneous interventions by fracturing calcific deposits and enabling subsequent interventions. However, larger prospective studies are warranted to validate these findings and establish IVL's role in DMS management. To further enhance this technique, research could focus on investigating the long-term outcomes and durability of mitral lithotripsy, as well as exploring its potential in combination with PMC or TMVR.
