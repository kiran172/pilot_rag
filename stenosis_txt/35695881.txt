Title: Levoatriocardinal vein in a patient with transposition of great arteries and pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: We report a case of a 3-month-old boy transposition of great arteries, ventricular septal defect, and pulmonary stenosis where computed tomography (CT) angiography detected a "levoatriocardinal vein" connecting the left superior pulmonary vein and the left brachiocephalic vein with a preserved normal connection between the left superior pulmonary vein and left atrium. This case highlights the hemodynamic implications of a "levoatriocardinal vein" as well as the role of CT angiography in detecting such associated cardiovascular anomalies in patients with complex congenital heart defects.
