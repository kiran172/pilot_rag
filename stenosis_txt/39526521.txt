Title: [Perioperative Myocardial Infarction and Successful Revascularization in Patient With Primary Metasynchronic Rectal, Gastric and Bladder Cancer].

Abstract: The article presents a clinical case of perioperative non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction in a patient with primary metasynchronous cancer of the rectum, stomach and bladder, which developed during simultaneous surgical intervention in the volume of proximal gastrectomy and abdominoperineal extirpation of the rectum. Fluctuations in blood pressure and imbalance in the hemostasis system at the stages of anesthesia and surgery in a patient with severe systemic atherosclerosis caused the development of myocardial ischemia in the area of significant coronary stenosis. Emergency coronary angiography detected subtotal stenosis of the anterior descending artery; stenting of the affected area of the coronary artery was performed. Monitoring of hemodynamic parameters and changes in the hemostasis system during the optimal antianginal therapy allowed to bring the patient out of critical condition and discharge him from the hospital on the 18th day.
