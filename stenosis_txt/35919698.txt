Title: Minimally invasive esophagectomy in the semi-prone position for corrosive esophagitis: a case report.

Abstract: Treatment strategies for corrosive esophagitis include conservative treatment, such as balloon dilatation at the stenosis site, and surgical treatment. Esophagectomy for corrosive esophagitis is usually performed through the transthoracic or transhiatal approaches. Herein, we report a case of corrosive esophagitis treated with thoracoscopic esophagectomy with the patient in the semi-prone position. The patient was a 48-year-old woman who developed corrosive esophagitis due to accidental ingestion of an alkaline agent. Surgical intervention was required for esophageal stenosis. Therefore, thoracoscopic esophagectomy was performed with the patient in the semi-prone position with bilateral pulmonary ventilation. In our hospital, good operative outcomes have been obtained using thoracoscopic esophagectomy for esophageal cancer with the patient in the semi-prone position with bilateral pulmonary ventilation. This technique is also considered effective for the treatment of corrosive esophagitis.
