Title: Serum Uric Acid and Lipid Levels in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: A Cross-Sectional Study.

Abstract: Background and objective Given the enormous public health burden posed by acute ischemic stroke (AIS), it becomes imperative to identify associated risk factors such as serum uric acid (SUA) and lipid profile that can be tangibly assessed. This could potentially provide useful markers for disease risk or progression, facilitating timely diagnosis and management of AIS. This study aimed to evaluate the SUA and lipid levels in patients with AIS. Method This cross-sectional study enrolled 66 AIS patients aged >18 years, from both genders. After a thorough medical history and clinical examination, each patient was subjected to SUA analysis and lipid profiling using an auto-analyzer with dedicated reagents. Results were statistically analyzed using Chi square test, and p-value ≤0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results and interpretation The study cohort showed a mean age of 61.17 ± 14.01 years and male to female (M:F) ratio of 1.7:1, with mean blood levels of SUA, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) reaching 5.68 ± 1.71 g/dL, 205.42 ± 105.08 g/dL, and 29.80 ± 8.45 g/dL, respectively. Most patients suffered from hypertension (81.82%), diabetes (77.27%), and alcoholism (24.24%). Cerebrovascular Doppler findings revealed the combined presence of plaque and stenosis (24.24%). Male AIS patients showed a significantly greater association with alcohol and smoking/nicotine use (p<0.001). Gender showed no significant association with SUA, lipid profile, hypertension, and diabetes (p>0.05). Conclusion AIS is associated with hyperuricemia and dyslipidemia, with no significant gender differences.
