Title: Atypical jejunal follicular lymphoma with severe stricture.

Abstract: The typical macroscopic appearance of gastrointestinal follicular lymphoma (FL) are multiple white granules or small white polyps, called multiple lymphomatous polyposis type, and subsequent mass lesions with or without ulceration; however, an ulcer type with a stricture is extremely rare. We report a case of a 79-year-old male with severe jejunal stricture due to FL with an uncommon chromosomal translocation t(2;18)(p12;q21). The patient was treated with jejunectomy subsequent rituximab monotherapy with a favorable response. The presence of the stricture made its endoscopic diagnosis confusing; however, it was certainly accompanied by the distinctive white granules on the surface of the tumor as seen in typical FL. With the possibility of an FL with stricture in mind, it is important to collect subtle endoscopic findings of the surrounding mucosa carefully, in order to arrive at an accurate endoscopic diagnosis and eventually to the proper therapeutic option.
