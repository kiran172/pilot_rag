Title: Trapped p waves causing loss of physiological left bundle branch pacing.

Abstract: We present the case of a 75-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis and moderate left ventricular dysfunction, who underwent elective transcatheter aortic valve replacement. After the procedure, the patient developed a left bundle branch block and a long PR interval. For this reason, a dual chamber pacemaker with pacing in the left bundle branch area was implanted. On device interrogation, we confirmed the presence of functional atrial undersensing causing loss of ventricular electric resynchronization. This case highlights the importance of recognizing this problem and, by means of device reprogramming and pharmacological intervention, suggests a stepwise approach to solve it.
