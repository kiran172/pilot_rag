Title: Electrocardiographic correlates of cardiac magnetic resonance findings in women with myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) occurs in 6-15 % of MI patients. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging identifies MINOCA etiologies, but access may be limited.
METHODS: We assessed associations between the index electrocardiogram (ECG) and CMR in MINOCA. Women with MI and < 50 % angiographic stenosis in all vessels were prospectively enrolled at 16 sites. CMR (median 6d from MI) was analyzed for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), myocardial edema, and wall motion. We assessed ECGs for T-wave inversions (TWI), Q-waves (QW), ST-elevations (STE), ST-depressions (STD), and fragmented QRS complexes (fQRS). We calculated the DETERMINE score (# leads TWI + # fQRS +2*[# QW], excluding aVR, V1).
RESULTS: Among 112 women with interpretable ECG, 81.3 % (91/112) had abnormal ECG; 50 % (56/112) had ≥1 TWI. CMR was abnormal in 74.1 % (83/112), with LGE in 49.1 % (55/112) and myocardial edema in 61.6 % (69/112). DETERMINE score ≥ 3 was associated with abnormal CMR (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] aOR 6.06 [1.89, 24.6], p = 0.002) and LGE (aOR 3.10 [1.26, 8.00], p = 0.013), but not edema (aOR 1.86 [0.80, 4.43], p = 0.152). TWI was also associated with abnormal CMR and LGE after adjustment (aOR 3.13 [1.08, 10.1], p = 0.036, aOR 3.23 [1.27, 8.63], p = 0.013, respectively), but not edema (aOR 1.26 [0.54, 2.96], p = 0.589). Specificity for abnormal CMR was 0.83 for DETERMINE score ≥ 3 and 0.75 for TWI. No other ECG findings were associated with CMR abnormality.
CONCLUSION: DETERMINE score ≥ 3 and the presence of any TWI were associated with abnormal CMR and with LGE in MINOCA. Our findings demonstrate that the index ECG can provide insight on CMR findings but without sensitivity or specificity required to forgo the CMR. We reaffirm the central role of CMR in elucidating MINOCA pathophysiology.
