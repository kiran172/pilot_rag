Title: Ischemic Stroke Secondary to Dynamic Vertebral Artery Stenosis: Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke secondary to dynamic vertebral artery stenosis or occlusion, also known as "bow hunter's syndrome," is a rare stroke mechanism. We report a case of a 24-year-old man with multiple hereditary exostosis (MHE) diagnosed at childhood. His first presentation to a neurologist was due to neck pain and clinical syndrome suggestive of ischemia in the vertebrobasilar territory. A therapeutic occlusion was done successfully without complication. The patient was discharged two days later on aspirin alone. In follow up one year later he continued to be symptom free. Moreover, this stroke mechanism has been reported extensively in the literature in isolation or secondary to many underlying diseases. In total, there are 168 cases reported in the published English literature, in either case reports or small series. In this review, we found that by far, vertebral artery occlusion at the atlanto-axial (C1-2) level dominated most reported cases. The most frequent presentation that led to further investigation was syncope or pre-syncope provoked by head rotation to one side. To our knowledge, there is no previous report of any stroke syndrome related to MHE before our case. In this paper, we report the first case secondary to MHE and review the literature up to date since the first reported case in 1952.
