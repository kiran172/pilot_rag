Title: [Impacts of incomplete revascularization following off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting on perioperative outcomes in octogenarians].

Abstract: Objective: To assess the impacts of incomplete revascularization following off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (OPCABG) on perioperative outcomes in octogenarians. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 242 octogenarian patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) hospitalized in Beijing Anzhen Hospital from June 2008 to July 2016 was performed. These patients were divided into the complete revascularization group (n=181) and the incomplete revascularization group (n=61) depending on whether they underwent complete revascularization. The impacts of incomplete revascularization following OPCABG on perioperative outcomes were summarized and compared between the two groups. Results: Among the 242 patients over 80 years who received OPCABG, there were 198 males (81.8%). Compared to the complete revascularization group, those in the incomplete revascularization group were older [(83.2±1.5) vs (81.5±1.1) years old, P=0.03], with more carotid stenosis (44.3% vs 25.4%, P=0.01), more involved in the diagonal and circumflex branch of coronary artery (49.2% vs 17.1%, P=0.01; 83.6% vs 70.2%, P=0.03), shorter operative time [(4.1±1.7) h vs (4.7±1.2) h, P=0.03), longer preoperative [(7.1±2.3) d vs (5.2±2.0) d, P=0.01] and total hospitalization time [(16.3±6.8) d vs (12.5±4.2) d, P=0.01], however, the differences of the in-hospital mortality and incidence of other perioperative complications were not statistically significant between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). Conclusion: Compared with complete revascularization, incomplete revascularization following OPCABG in CAD patients over 80 years old does not increase the perioperative mortality and the incidence of other complications, and it reduces the operative time. However, it increases the time of preoperative and total hospital stay.
