Title: An arcade in the heart: Multimodality imaging.

Abstract: Congenital mitral stenosis (MS) is a spectrum of anomalies that result in functional and anatomic obstruction of inflow into the left ventricle. Mitral arcade is one of the varieties of congenital MS where there is an abnormal development of chordae tendineae, resulting in stenosis, regurgitation, or both. Here, we describe the case of a mitral arcade in a child, which was diagnosed on echocardiography and confirmed with other imaging modalities.
