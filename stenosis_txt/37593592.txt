Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy for Severe RVOT Calcification to Optimize Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The presence of severe right ventricular outflow tract calcification may preclude safe and effective transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement in patients with pulmonary allograft stenosis owing to the risk of conduit tear and suboptimal annular expansion. Debulking calcium using intravascular lithotripsy within the right ventricular outflow tract may mitigate this risk and improve valve hemodynamics. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
