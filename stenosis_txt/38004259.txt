Title: Long-Term Clinical Impact of Patients with Multi-Vessel Non-Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) is a disease commonly diagnosed in patients undergoing coronary angiography. However, little is known regarding the long-term clinical impact of multi-vessel non-obstructive CAD. Therefore, the object of this study was to investigate the long-term clinical impact of multi-vessel non-obstructive CAD.
METHOD: A total of 2083 patients without revascularization history and obstructive CAD were enrolled between January 2010 and December 2015. They were classified into four groups according to number of vessels involved in non-obstructive CAD (25% â‰¤ luminal stenosis < 70%): zero, one, two, or three diseased vessels (DVs). We monitored the patients for 5 years. The primary outcome was major cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), defined as a composite of cardiac death, stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI).
RESULT: The occurrence of MACCEs increased as the number of non-obstructive DVs increased, and was especially high in patients with three DVs. After adjustment, patients with three DVs still showed significantly poorer clinical outcomes of MACCEs, stroke, and MI compared those with zero DVs.
CONCLUSION: Multi-vessel non-obstructive CAD, especially in patients with non-obstructive three DVs, is strongly associated with poor long-term clinical outcomes. This finding suggests that more intensive treatment may be required in this subset of patients.
