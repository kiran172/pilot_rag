Title: Clinical application of super sensitive microflow ultrasound on the detection of intraplaque neovascularization in patients with atheromatous carotid artery plaque.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a routine technique for detecting intraplaque neovascularization (IPN). However, the invasiveness and complexity of CEUS severely limit its clinical application. This article aims to investigate the application value of AngioPLUS (AP) technique in assessing IPN formation in patients with atheromatous (AS) carotid artery plaque.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with carotid artery atherosclerosis combined plaque formation were recruited and their demographic characteristics including serum fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were collected. AP was used to scoring intraplaque microvascular flow (IMVF), measuring the thickness and length of the plaque and determining the number of IPN of the plaque.
RESULTS: IMVF score evaluated by AP was positively correlated with plaque length, thickness, IPN number, serum TG, LDL and FBG levels in patients with carotid atherosclerosis with plaque. The evaluation results of CEUS score and IMVF classification detected by AP of plaques were consistent in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSION: IMVF scoring by AP is a promising approach to assess IPN and plaque status in patients with atheromatous carotid artery plaque.
