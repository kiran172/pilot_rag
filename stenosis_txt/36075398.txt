Title: Residual Lesion Severity Predicts Midterm Outcomes After Congenital Aortic Valve Repair.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We sought to validate the technical performance score (TPS) as a predictor of midterm outcomes after congenital aortic valve repair.
METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective review of consecutive patients who underwent aortic valve repair between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2019. Predischarge echocardiograms were used to assign a TPS for each index operation as class 1, no aortic valve residua; class 2, minor aortic valve residua; or class 3, major aortic valve residua or predischarge reintervention for major residua. The primary outcome was postdischarge (late) unplanned aortic valve reintervention. Secondary outcomes included late mortality and at least moderate aortic regurgitation or stenosis at the latest follow-up or before the earliest reintervention. Associations between TPS and outcomes were assessed using competing risk, Cox proportional hazards, or logistic regression models, adjusting for preoperative patient- and procedure-related covariates.
RESULTS: Of 507 patients, there were 110 (21.7%) reinterventions, 22 (4.3%) deaths, and 67 (13.2%) cases of at least moderate aortic regurgitation or stenosis at the latest follow-up or earliest reintervention. On multivariable analysis, class 3 patients had a greater risk of reintervention (subdistribution hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.3-5.1; P = .005) and mortality (hazard ratio, 5.3; 95% CI. 1.1-25.2; P = .038) compared with class 1 patients. Adjusting for duration of follow-up, class 3 patients also had a greater risk of at least moderate aortic regurgitation or stenosis at the latest follow-up or earliest reintervention (odds ratio, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.5-24.2; P < .001) vs class 1 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with major residua after congenital aortic valve repair have significantly worse midterm outcomes compared with those with no residua, warranting closer follow-up.
