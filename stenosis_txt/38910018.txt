Title: Coronary Artery Revascularization in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Patients with concomitant severe aortic stenosis and significant coronary artery disease present a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge in clinical practice. There are no clear-cut guidelines as to the timing of revascularization in these patients who are referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This article aims to show that in patients without high-grade proximal coronary artery disease, revascularization after TAVR is safe, feasible, and practical. Additionally, the use of preoperative TAVR computed tomographic angiography might be used in both intermediate and high-risk patients rather than invasive coronary angiography to assess for significant proximal coronary artery disease to help guide the timing of revascularization.
