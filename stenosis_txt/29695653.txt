Title: Pulmonary Resection for Lung Cancer Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: An 82-year-old woman was referred to our hospital because of dyspnea on effort. Echocardiography revealed severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). Simultaneously, chest computed tomography (CT) revealed a 19-mm nodule in the lower lobe of the right lung, and bronchoscopic biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma. She underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe AS. Three weeks later, she underwent lower lobectomy of the right lung and mediastinal dissection for the lung cancer. Her postoperative course was good, and she was discharged 8 days postoperatively. In conclusion, we encountered a patient who successfully underwent pulmonary resection for lung cancer following TAVI for severe AS. We suggest that pulmonary resection following TAVI is an acceptable choice for lung cancer in patients with severe AS because of the lack of a need for cardiopulmonary bypass, the high safety and efficacy of two-stage therapy, and the short period between the two therapies.
