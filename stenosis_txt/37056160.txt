Title: Balloon Bronchoplasty for the Treatment of Bronchial Stenosis After Lung Transplantation: A Single-Center 10-Year Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the safety and efficacy of balloon dilatation under dual guidance using fluoroscopy and bronchoscopy for treating bronchial stenosis following lung transplantation (LT), and to elucidate the factors associated with patency after the procedure.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From September, 2012, to April, 2021, 50 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 54.4 ± 12.2 years) with bronchial stenosis among 361 recipients of LT were retrospectively analyzed. The safety of balloon dilatation was assessed by evaluating procedure-related complications. Efficacy was assessed by evaluating the technical success, primary patency, and secondary patency. Primary and secondary cumulative patency rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The factors associated with patency after the procedure were evaluated using multivariable Cox hazard proportional regression analysis.
RESULTS: In total, 65 bronchi were treated with balloon dilatation in 50 patients. The total number of treatment sessions was 277 and the technical success rate was 99.3% (275/277 sessions). No major procedure-related complications were noted. During the mean follow-up period of 34.6 ± 30.8 months, primary patency was achieved in 12 of 65 bronchi (18.5%). However, the patency rate improved to 76.9% (50 of 65 bronchi) after repeated balloon dilatation (secondary patency). The 6-month, 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year secondary patency rates were 95.4%, 90.8%, 83.1%, and 78.5%, respectively. The presence of clinical symptoms was a significant prognostic factor associated with reduced primary patency (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.465; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.220-0.987). Early-stage treatment ≤ 6 months (adjusted HR, 3.588; 95% CI, 1.093-11.780) and prolonged balloon dilatation > 5 min (adjusted HR, 3.285; 95% CI, 1.018-10.598) were associated with significantly higher secondary patency.
CONCLUSION: Repeated balloon dilatation was determined to be safe and effective for treating bronchial stenosis following LT. Early-stage treatment and prolonged balloon dilatation could significantly promote long-term patency.
