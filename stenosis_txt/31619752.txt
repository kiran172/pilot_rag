Title: Neurological injury as a complication of spinal surgery: incidence, risk factors, and prognosis.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVE: To assess the rate, injury site, aetiology and outcomes in elective spinal surgery patients who sustained a spinal cord injury (SCI).
SETTING: SCI national centre Toledo, Spain.
METHODS: The study sample included patients who sustained an SCI after elective spinal surgery from 2013 to 2017. Oncological patients and patients receiving interventional therapies were excluded. Data collected included: demographics, aetiology, precipitating cause, injury mechanism, injury site, neurological status (AIS), SCIMIII at admission and discharge, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dyslipidemia, depression and hospital length of stay.
RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and eighty-two patients were admitted in this period of whom 114 met the inclusion criteria with a median (IQR) age of 58 (45-69) years; 46% female. The prevalence of SCI as a complication following spinal surgery in the total number of patients admitted to our centre was 9%. In 43%, the injury was to the dorsal spine with T12 being the most common neurological level of injury (20% of cases following laminectomy secondary to spinal canal stenosis). The most frequent precipitating cause was epidural haematoma (38% of cases). The median (IQR) SCIMIII scores at admission and discharge were (31) points (20-54) and (67) points (34-81), respectively. General AIS at admission were C (35%) and D at discharge (54%). The presence of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity and dyslipidemia adjusted by age was not linked to a higher complication rate. The median (IQR) hospital length of stay was 120 days (60-189).
CONCLUSION: In total 8.9% of patients admitted with SCI were the result of elective spinal surgery.
