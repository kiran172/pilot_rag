Title: Endovascular treatment of arterio-ureteral fistula with new-generation balloon-expandable stent graft using a 7-French system.

Abstract: Arterio-ureteral fistulas are relatively rare, but a potentially life-threatening condition because of the possible massive bleeding. An 82-year-old woman with a history of hysterectomy and irradiation for uterine cancer was treated with ureteric stents for recurrent bilateral ureteral stenosis. During the adjustments of the stent, removing the right ureteric stent immediately resulted in massive hematuria. Computed tomography showed that the right ureter coursed above and seemed to be connected to the right external iliac artery. From the clinical history and computed tomography findings, an arterio-ureteral fistula between the right external iliac artery and right ureter was strongly suspected. The GORE® VIABAHN® VBX Stent Graft was deployed from the common iliac artery to the external iliac artery via a 7-French femoral system, followed by post-dilatation. The patient did not develop any complications or recurrence of hematuria after the procedure during the 11-month follow-up. The VBX is a useful device, with a low- profile device and a size-adjustable balloon-expandable stent that depended on the individual vessel size for post-dilatation. However, there are several concerns, such as risk of infection, stent thrombosis/stenosis, and chronic outcome while using stent grafts for treatment. Patients with arterio-ureteral fistulas who were treated using stent grafts should be carefully followed up.
