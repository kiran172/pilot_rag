Title: Can maneuverability in the robot assisted laparoscopic stapler during ileoileal anastomosis compensate for shorter stapler length? - A randomized experimental porcine study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ileal anastomosis is imperative in patients given a urinary diversion during radical cystectomy. Proper handling and staplers with a certain length are important to prevent stenosis of the bowel. The study aim was to compare the circumference and diameter of ileoileal anastomoses using the Endo GIA tri-stapler 45 mm and 60 mm iDrive systems compared to the RAL Endowrist DaVinci 45 mm. This was to investigate if the better maneuverability of the robotic stapler would compensate for the shorter stapler length in the RAL Endowrist DaVinci 45.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty ileoileal anastomoses were performed in a total of three pigs after randomization according to the type of anastomosis technique used (depending on stapler and robotic system) allocated to four groups (each with five anastomoses): (1) iDrive 45 mm, (2) iDrive 60 mm, (3) RAL DaVinci 45 mm (Si-system), and (4) RAL DaVinci 45 mm (Xi-system). Diameter (mm) and circumference (mm) were measured and compared.
RESULTS: Diameters and circumferences in Group 1 were significantly smaller compared to all the other groups, which did not differ from each other, except in Group 2 where anastomoses had a significantly higher circumference than Group 4.
CONCLUSION: The iDrive 60 mm makes the anastomoses with the widest diameter and highest circumference compared to the iDrive 45 mm. With the RAL DaVinci 45 mm, the diameter and circumference were comparable to the iDrive 60 mm and significantly better than the iDrive 45 mm. An explanation may be the better maneuverability and surgeon control of the RAL DaVinci stapler.
