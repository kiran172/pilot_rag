Title: Trends and Predictors of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Related In-Hospital Mortality (From the National Inpatient Sample Database).

Abstract: Existing surgical aortic valve replacement risk models accurately predict the post- surgical aortic valve replacement morbidity and mortality, but factors associated with post transcatheter aortic valve Implantation (TAVI) mortality are not well known. The National Inpatient Sample was queried to identify all cases of TAVI. The association of baseline comorbidities with in-hospital mortality was determined using a binary logistic regression model to obtain adjusted odds ratios (aOR). A total of 161,049 patients underwent TAVI between 2010 and 2017. Of these, 157,151 (97.6%) survived while 3,898 (2.4%) died during hospitalization. The baseline characteristics of TAVI-survivors and non-survivors showed a significant amount of variation, including age (80 vs 82 years, p ≤ 0.0001) and female sex (46% vs 52%, p ≤ 0.0001), respectively. The non-survivors had significantly higher adjusted odds of renal failure requiring hemodialysis (aOR 2.59, 95% CI 2.24 to 2.99, p ≤ 0.0001), history of mediastinal radiation (aOR 2.71, 95% CI 1.02 to 7.20, p = 0.05), liver disease (aOR 3.04, 95% CI 2.63 to 3.51, p ≤ 0.0001), pneumonia (aOR 2.47, 95% CI 2.15 to 2.83, p ≤ 0.0001), cardiogenic shock (aOR 9.83, 95% CI 8.93 to 10.82, p ≤ 0.0001), ventricular tachycardia (aOR 2.12, 95% CI 1.88 to 2.40, p ≤ 0.0001), acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (aOR 7.38, 95% CI 5.53 to 9.84, p ≤ 0.0001), stroke (aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.99 to 2.54, p ≤ 0.0001), and acute infective endocarditis (aOR 5.74, 95% CI 3.65 to 9.02, p ≤ 0.0001) compared to TAVI-survivors. The yearly trend of mortality showed an increase in the absolute number of TAVI procedures and mortality but the yearly rate showed a decline in mortality after an initial peak during 2012.Patients with renal failure on dialysis, ST-elevation myocardial infarction, cardiogenic shock, infective endocarditis, liver disease and pneumonia have a higher rate of in-hospital mortality post TAVI.
