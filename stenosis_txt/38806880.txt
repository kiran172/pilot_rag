Title: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension secondary to Superior Sagittal Sinus Stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a disease characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) without established etiology. Venous sinus stenosis contributes to IIH; however, it is still uncertain whether the stenosis is a primary cause of IIH or a secondary result in response to elevated ICP. Transverse sinus stenosis is frequently identified in patients with IIH and it is suggestive of raised ICP. Here, we report a case of IIH caused by intrinsic superior sagittal sinus stenosis (SSS).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man suffered from IIH with headache, papilledema, and visual impairment. Angiography demonstrated isolated SSS stenosis with a pressure gradient of 30Â mmHg. SSS stenosis was resistant to revascularization by stenting alone and intrastent balloon angioplasty was then performed to overcome such resistance. The rigidity of the vein wall suggests that the vein is not collapsed and the stenosis is intrinsic, secondary to idiopathic anatomical local changes. Post-procedure headache disappeared and visual acuity improved.
CONCLUSION: An isolated SSS stenosis could lead to intracranial hypertension and this condition should be taken into account in the diagnostic workup of IIH. By now, SSS stenosis is not mentioned in any current consensus guidelines or paper on the diagnostic workflow of intracranial hypertension.
