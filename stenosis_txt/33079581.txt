Title: Outcomes of Definitive Draining Seton Placement for Complex Anal Fistula in Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: Definitive draining seton (DDS) alone is an accepted treatment for complex refractory anal fistulas in Crohn's disease (CD). We evaluated the long-term success of DDS in CD patients. DDS was defined as draining seton placed definitively for at least 12Â months. Primary end point was clinical response (CR) defined as a lack of induration, pain, swelling, abscess recurrence, or unintended dislodgement. The study cohort of 23 patients had a median age of 29 (range; 9-61) years and included 14 males (61%). Reasons for DDS included anal stenosis (n = 9; 39%), active proctitis (n = 9; 39%), and/or anal canal ulceration (n = 9; 39%). Median number of setons was 2 (range; 1-6) and 65% had multiple fistula tracts. Almost all patients (n = 22; 96%) were on a biologic postoperatively. At 12-month follow-up, only 39% (n = 9) had a CR. The remaining 14 patients failed due to new abscess formation (n = 6; 26%), new fistula formation (n = 6; 26%), and seton dislodgement (n = 2; 9%). Six (26%) patients required fecal diversion. No patients required proctectomy. DDS for complex CD fistula results in a mediocre CR with many patients developing recurrent abscess/fistula or requiring diversion despite biologic therapy.
