Title: Controlled mitral valvuloplasty using steerable catheter- waist- formed balloon system: A clinical case series.

Abstract: As the general population ages, the incidence of degenerative mitral stenosis (MS) among patients has increased. Percutaneous mitral valvuloplasty (PMV) has emerged as a well-established option for mitral rheumatic stenosis with specific characteristics. However, a blank therapeutic space must be filled with the treatment options for degenerative or rheumatic mitral stenosis in patients with many comorbidities and contraindication for valvuloplasty. We here present a comprehensive overview of the current possibilities, despite their scarce success. That is the reason why we propose a case series to facilitate a better understanding of our innovative technique in this challenging clinical context.
