Title: Early onset of left ventricular regional asynchrony in arteries with sub-clinical stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Asynchrony has been reported to be a marker of ischemic-induced left ventricular dysfunction, the magnitude of which correlates with extent of epicardial coronary disease. We wished to determine whether normal-appearing arterial territories with mild degrees of asynchrony have lower 82Rb PET absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and/or lower myocardial flow reserve (MFR).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Data were examined retrospectively for 105 patients evaluated for known/suspected CAD who underwent rest/regadenoson-stress 82Rb PET/CT and quantitative coronary angiography. Rest and stress absolute MBF and MFR were quantified from first-pass 82Rb PET curves. Regional relative myocardial perfusion summed stress score (SSS), summed rest score (SRS), regional phase bandwidth (BW), and regional semi-quantitative asynchrony visual scores of (Asynch) were assessed. We found that in apparently normal arteries (SSS &lt; 4, SRS &lt; 4 and stenosis &lt; 70%), those with abnormally low MFR &lt; 2.0 compared to those with MFR ≥ 2.0 had larger phase BW (186 ± 79° vs 158 ± 67°, P = .02), and more visually apparent Asynch (5.7 ± 4.2 vs 3.9 ± 3.6, P = .02), which was associated with increasing stenosis values (ρ = 0.44, P &lt; .0001).
CONCLUSION: A subgroup of coronary territories with normal relative perfusion and normal or non-obstructive coronary disease may have reduced MFR, which is signaled physiologically by a mild degree of left ventricular asynchrony.
