Title: Tooth-Cutting-Induced Maxillary Malocclusion Exacerbates Cognitive Deficit in a Mouse Model of Vascular Dementia.

Abstract: Treatments to restore the balance of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) are performed in the field of complementary and alternative medicine; however, evidence supporting this approach remains weak. Therefore, this study attempted to establish such evidence. Bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) operation, which is commonly used for the establishment of a mouse model of vascular dementia, was performed, followed by tooth cutting (TEX) for maxillary malocclusion to promote the imbalance of the TMJ. Behavioural changes, changes in nerve cells and changes in gene expression were assessed in these mice. The TEX-induced imbalance of the TMJ caused a more severe cognitive deficit in mice with BCAS, as indicated by behavioural changes in the Y-maze test and novel object recognition test. Moreover, inflammatory responses were induced via astrocyte activation in the hippocampal region of the brain, and the proteins involved in inflammatory responses were found to be involved in these changes. These results indirectly show that therapies that restore the balance of the TMJ can be effectively used for the management of cognitive-deficit-related brain diseases associated with inflammation.
