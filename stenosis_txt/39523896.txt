Title: Coronary Angiographic Features of de Winter Syndrome: More Than Just Occlusion of the Left Anterior Descending Artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The de Winter electrocardiogram (ECG) pattern is a rare presentation of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) equivalent. The clinical profile of de Winter syndrome remains to be clarified.
METHODS: Medical records of 1865 consecutive patients with acute myocardial infarction admitted from November 2018 to July 2023 were screened. Twelve patients (0.6%) with de Winter syndrome were included. STEMI patients whose culprit vessel was the left anterior descending artery (LAD) but without de Winter ECG pattern were selected as controls after 1:2 matching for age and sex.
RESULTS: The de Winter syndrome patients were all male, aged 49.0 (46.3-52.5) years. The culprit lesion was the proximal LAD in seven patients (58.3%), the middle LAD in three (25%), the left main coronary artery in one (8.3%), and the ramus intermedius artery in the other. All of their culprit lesions had TIMI Thrombus Grade < 4, Cohen-Rentrop Score ≤ 2, and residual stenosis ≥ 80% after pretreatment with thrombus aspiration or balloon predilatation. Intracoronary imaging data were available in four patients, showing severe atherosclerotic stenosis. Compared with STEMI, de Winter syndrome had a higher prevalence of prior recurrent angina (75.0% vs. 37.5%, p = 0.034), better coronary collateralization (Cohen-Rentrop Score: 1 vs. 0, p = 0.001), lower thrombus burden (TIMI grade: 1 vs. 2, p = 0.005) but more severe atherosclerotic stenosis in the culprit lesions (90% vs. 60%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The culprit lesions of de Winter syndrome have a low thrombus burden, severe atherosclerotic stenosis, and poor collateral circulation protection.
