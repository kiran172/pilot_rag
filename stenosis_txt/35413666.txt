Title: A rare case of adenocarcinoma of an ectopic pancreas: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ectopic pancreas refers to the presence of pancreatic tissue in an unusual anatomical location that has neither anatomic nor vascular continuity with the pancreas. Adenocarcinoma of an ectopic pancreas is rare; only few cases have been described in the literature.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We reported a 69-year-old man who was admitted to the emergency department with feculent vomiting lasting two days prior to presentation. Endoscopy revealed pyloric stenosis. Biopsies performed during gastroscopy were in keeping with duodenal cancer, while those performed during endoscopic ultrasound suggested a gastric tumor. A subtotal gastrectomy was done because of results of the extemporaneous analysis and the suspicion of a gastric cancer. The final histopathological report revealed adenocarcinoma of an ectopic pancreas.
DISCUSSION: Malignant transformation of an ectopic pancreas is very rare, and often occurs as an adenocarcinoma. A differential diagnosis of a gastric adenocarcinoma and a gastrointestinal stromal tumor is essential before treatment. Outcome and a literature review of the pathology, prognosis, and treatment will be discussed.
CONCLUSION: Despite adenocarcinoma of an ectopic pancreas being rare, it should be considered as a differential diagnosis of submucosal tumors. The standard treatment for ectopic pancreatic adenocarcinoma is surgery, with a higher survival rate of 5Â years compared to pancreatic cancer. Frozen section analysis is essential because it will give an idea on the origin of the neoplasia and allow adaptation of the surgical procedure.
