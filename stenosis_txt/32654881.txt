Title: Protective Effects of Contractubex® on Stricture Formation after Experimental Corrosive Esophageal Burns in Rats.

Abstract: AIM/BACKGROUND: Although many agents have been tested as treatment options for caustic esophageal burn (CEB), none have successfully suppressed the formation of strictures. Thus,the purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of Contractubex® gel (10% onion extract, 50 U/gr heparin, and 1% allantoin) in stricture preventing after CEB.
METHODS: In this study, 24 Wistar-albino rats were divided into 4 groups. CEB was initiated with an instillation of 1 mL of 10% NaOH solution into the an isolated esophageal segment for 3 min. Group C (control) was uninjured and untreated. In Group CEB, was initiated but no treatment was given. In Groups CTX1 and CTX2, the animals received 100 and 200 mg/kg/d, respectively, of Contractubex® for 4 weeks via gavage after CEB was initiated. The stenosis indices (SI), histopathologic damage scores, tissue hydroxyproline (HP) levels, and weights of the rats were taken before the experiment and 4 weeks after the experiment.
RESULTS: The Mean SI levels, HP levels, and histopathologic damage scores were statistically lower in Groups CTX1 and CTX2 when compared with Group CEB (p &lt;0.05). The treatment groups increased in weight when compared to Group CEB. The results were similar between Group CTX1 and Group CTX2 (p &gt;0,05); the efficacy of the treatment was not dose-dependent.
CONCLUSION: For the first time, Contractubex® was used for its antifibrotic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and wound healing effects to treat caustic esophageal burn in rats. It was effective in reducing stricture formation by decreasing the HP levels and histopathologic damage as well as preventing stenosis and weight gain in the treatment groups.
