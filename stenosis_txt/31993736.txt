Title: Drug-coated balloon versus drug-eluting stent in small coronary artery lesions: angiographic analysis from the BASKET-SMALL 2 trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The randomized BASKET-SMALL 2 trial showed non-inferiority for treatment with drug-coated balloon (DCB) compared with drug-eluting stents (DES) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for de novo lesions in small coronary arteries regarding clinical endpoints at 1 year. In this predefined substudy, we investigated the angiographic findings in patients undergoing a clinically indicated follow-up angiography during the study phase.
METHODS: Eight-hundred and eighty-three patients underwent PCI with either DES or DCB in a culprit vessel < 3 mm in diameter for stable coronary artery disease or acute coronary syndrome. Event-driven re-angiographies and the corresponding images at baseline were analyzed for angiographic endpoints.
RESULTS: One-hundred and eleven patients (117 lesions, 66 DES versus 51 DCB) presented for an unscheduled re-angiography at median 5.7 months after the index procedure. At baseline, mean reference vessel diameter was 2.05 mm and the residual in-segment stenosis after the index procedure was less in DES compared to DCB (23.7% vs 33.8%, p = 0.001). At follow-up angiography, diameter stenosis in the DES group (29.0%) was still somewhat smaller than after DCB angioplasty (35.8%) when adjusting for time since PCI (p = 0.047), whereas lumen loss (LL) did not differ between the two treatment arms (LL-DES 0.06 mm vs LL-DCB 0.10 mm, p = 0.20). Eight patients following DES implantation presented with a complete occlusion of the target lesion compared to no occlusion in the DCB group (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: The clinically indicated follow-up angiography within 1 year showed no difference in LL. Complete thrombotic vessel occlusions were found only in the DES group.
