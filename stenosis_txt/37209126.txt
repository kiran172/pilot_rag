Title: Feasibility of accelerated non-contrast-enhanced whole-heart bSSFP coronary MR angiography by deep learning-constrained compressed sensing.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To examine a compressed sensing artificial intelligence (CSAI) framework to accelerate image acquisition in non-contrast-enhanced whole-heart bSSFP coronary magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.
METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers and 20 patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) scheduled for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) were enrolled. Non-contrast-enhanced coronary MR angiography was performed with CSAI, compressed sensing (CS), and sensitivity encoding (SENSE) methods in healthy participants and with CSAI in patients. Acquisition time, subjective image quality score, and objective image quality measurement (blood pool homogeneity, signal-to-noise ratio [SNR], and contrast-to-noise ratio [CNR]) were compared among the three protocols. The diagnostic performance of CASI coronary MR angiography for predicting significant stenosis (≥ 50% diameter stenosis) on CCTA was evaluated. The Friedman test was performed to compare the three protocols.
RESULTS: Acquisition time was significantly shorter in the CSAI and CS groups than in the SENSE group (10.2 ± 3.2 min vs. 10.9 ± 2.9 min vs. 13.0 ± 4.1 min, p < 0.001). However, the CSAI approach had the highest image quality scores, blood pool homogeneity, mean SNR value, and mean CNR value (all p < 0.001) compared with the CS and SENSE approaches. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of CSAI coronary MR angiography per patient were 87.5% (7/8), 91.7% (11/12), and 90.0% (18/20); those per vessel were 81.8% (9/11), 93.9% (46/49), and 91.7% (55/60); and those per segment were 84.6% (11/13), 98.0% (244/249), and 97.3% (255/262), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: CSAI yielded superior image quality within a clinically feasible acquisition time in healthy participants and patients with suspected CAD.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The non-invasive and radiation-free CSAI framework could be a promising tool for rapid screening and comprehensive examination of the coronary vasculature in patients with suspected CAD.
KEY POINTS: • This prospective study showed that CSAI enables a reduction in acquisition time by 22% with superior diagnostic image quality compared with the SENSE protocol. • CSAI replaces the wavelet transform with a CNN as a sparsifying transform in the CS algorithm, achieving high coronary MR image quality with reduced noise. • CSAI achieved per-patient sensitivity of 87.5% (7/8) and specificity of 91.7% (11/12) respectively for detecting significant coronary stenosis.
