Title: Paravalvular leak closure after TAVI with plugs: A literature review with a specific focus on arterio-arterial loop.

Abstract: More than mild paravalvular leak (PVL) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is associated with a twofold increase in all-cause mortality, heart failure hospitalizations, and the need for reintervention. Successfully addressing PVL in TAVIs is more challenging than in surgical valves. The arterial-arterial (A-A) rail technique emerges as a valuable strategy for post-TAVI PVL closure, enhancing success rates by enabling the effective use of lower-profile vascular plug devices. When standard approach is ineffective, generating an A-A loop for post-TAVI PVL closure is probably the most recommended strategy to ensure procedural success.
