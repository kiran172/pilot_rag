Title: 68 Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT Imaging of Tracheal Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma.

Abstract: A 23-year-old woman presented with a dry cough and dyspnea. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed an intratracheal space-occupying lesion with continuous homogeneous enhancement and airway stenosis. The patient then underwent 68 Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT, which showed increased uptake of FAPI-04 by the lesion. Postoperative pathology confirmed the lesion as tracheal mucoepidermoid carcinoma. This case reports a rare site of mucoepidermoid carcinoma and highlights the potential utility of 68 Ga-DOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT for the diagnosis of tracheal mucoepidermoid carcinoma.
