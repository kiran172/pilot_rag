Title: Prevalence of Intracranial Artery Stenosis in Patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke in a Tertiary Care Hospital of China.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Intracranial artery stenosis is the most common cause of acute ischemic stroke, especially among people in Asia. About its epidemiology, however little is understood. The goal of our research is to establish the prevalence of intracranial artery stenosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke in a tertiary care hospital.
METHODS: A descriptive cross-sectional study was done in 1006 acute ischemic stroke patients at Affiliated Zhongda Hospital, School of Medicine, Southeast University China from May 2018 to May 2019. Ethical approval was taken from the Ethical review committee of the institution. A convenient sampling method was done. Intracranial artery stenosis was diagnosed when evidence of acute ischemic stroke was found in the territory of approximately 2 50% stenosis identified by Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and confirmed by magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomography. Statistical analysis was done using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.
RESULTS: The prevalence of intracranial artery stenosis was found in 331 (32.90%) patients at 95% Confidence interval (0.24-0.42%). Among 331 cases the anterior circulation artery stenosis was present on 201 (19.98%) patients, followed by posterior circulation artery stenosis on 80 (7.95%) patients, then anterior plus posterior circulation artery stenosis on 50 (4.97%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Intracranial artery stenosis is one of the most causes of acute ischemic stroke in China. The proportion of anterior circulation artery stenosis was higher than that in the posterior circulation.
