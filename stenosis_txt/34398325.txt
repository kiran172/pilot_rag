Title: Annoyed with Haemorrhoids? Risks of the Emborrhoid Technique.

Abstract: Haemorrhoids, a common ailment afflicting mostly Western patients, can produce bothersome symptoms, in particular pain, pruritus, and bleeding. There is a wide choice of surgical treatment options available for haemorrhoids in patients that cannot be treated with medical therapy, such as those that are prolapsed. Many patients refuse surgery due to the fear of potential complications; to overcome this obstacle, novel alternative techniques have been developed in recent years that are focussed on ligation or occlusion of haemorrhoidal arterial blood flow. We describe a patient who developed recto-sigmoidal ischaemia after embolization of the haemorrhoidal arteries, known as the "emborrhoid" technique, with persistence of rectal bleeding and progressive rectal stenosis.
