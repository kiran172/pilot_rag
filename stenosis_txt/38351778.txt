Title: The role of periprocedural hemodynamic variables during carotid stenting for the mid-term general mortality in advanced age patients.

Abstract: Carotid stenting may produce significant bradycardia and/or hypotension. This may have negative short- and long-term effects for the elderly high-risk patients. Their cerebral hemodynamics is with exhausted adaptive capacity because of the multiple cardiovascular risk factors, advanced age, and significant stenosis.
