Title: A modified esophagogastric reconstruction method after laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy: A technical note with video vignette.

Abstract: TECHNIQUE: Although the double flap technique effectively reduces the incidence of postoperative reflux esophagitis and anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic gastrectomy, its clinical application is restricted because the procedure is technical complex. We devised a modified esophagogastric reconstructive method which we termed the "arch-bridge-type" reconstruction. This reconstruction method was performed for a 71-year-old man, who was admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of cT2N0 upper gastric cancer. The present study reported the surgical details and accompanied with the video.
RESULTS: The patient underwent surgery successfully without switching to open surgery. The total operation time was 203 min, the time for making the "arch-bridge" was 16 min, and the time for esophagogastric anastomosis under laparoscopy was 23 min. No surgery-related complications occurred. The postoperative hospital stay was 10 days. The upper GI radiography demonstrated that the anastomosis was not narrow and no extravasation of contrast agent was observed. The gastroscopy found no reflux esophagitis and anastomotic stenosis 1 year after surgery.
CONCLUSION: The "arch-bridge-type" reconstruction method is safe and time saving. It has advantages in simplifying the procedure of conventional double flap technique and reducing postoperative complications after proximal gastrectomy.
