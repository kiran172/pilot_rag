Title: Modified wallace anastomotic technique reduces ureteroenteric stricture rates after ileal conduit urinary diversion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare perioperative outcomes, complications and anastomotic stricture rate in a contemporary series of patients who underwent open radical cystectomy (RC) with modified Wallace anastomotic technique versus traditional ileal conduit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Study enrolled 180 patients, of whom 140 were randomized and underwent RC; seventy were randomized to group I and the seventy to the group II. For the primary objective, we hypothesized that the rate of ureteroenteric strictures would be at least 20 % lower in the second group. Secondary end points included rate of anastomotic leak, surgical time, deterioration of the upper tract, intraoperative blood loss and patient-reported quality of life (HRQOL). The modified Wallace 1 technique involved eversion of the ureteral plate and bowel mucosa edges, which were anastomosed together in running fashion, while the outher anastomotic wall was augmented with sero-serosal interrupted sutures.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) follow-up time was 26.1 (5.7) months in group I and 25.2 (4.8) months in group II, during which, anastomotic stricture was observed in 8 patients (12%) from the first and 2 patients (3%) from the second group (p < 0.05). The anastomotic leakage rate was significantly higher in first group (17% vs. 8.5%, p < 0.05), while patient-reported HRQOL outcomes were similar between groups after the 12 month follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: By using a modified Wallace technique, we were able to significantly lower anastomotic stricture and anastomotic leakage rates, which are major issues in minimizing both short- and long-term postoperative complications.
