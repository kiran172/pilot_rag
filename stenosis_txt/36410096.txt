Title: A clinical decision support system for predicting coronary artery stenosis in patients with suspected coronary heart disease.

Abstract: Invasive coronary angiography imposes risks and high medical costs. Therefore, accurate, reliable, non-invasive, and cost-effective methods for diagnosing coronary stenosis are required. We designed a machine learning-based risk-prediction system as an accurate, noninvasive, and cost-effective alternative method for evaluating suspected coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Electronic medical record data were collected from suspected CHD patients undergoing coronary angiography between May 1, 2017, and December 31, 2019. Multi-Class XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest, NGBoost, logistic models and MLP were constructed to identify patients with normal coronary arteries (class 0: no coronary artery stenosis), minimum coronary artery stenosis (class 1: 0 < stenosis <50%), and CHD (class 2: stenosis ≥50%). Model stability was verified externally. A risk-assessment and management system was established for patient-specific intervention guidance. Of 1577 suspected CHD patients, 81 (5.14%) had normal coronary arteries. The XGBoost model demonstrated the best overall classification performance (micro-average receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve: 0.92, macro-average ROC curve: 0.89, class 0 ROC curve: 0.88, class 1 ROC curve: 0.90, class 2 ROC curve: 0.89), with good external verification. In class-specific classification, the XGBoost model yielded F1 values of 0.636, 0.850, and 0.858, for Classes 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The visualization system allowed disease diagnosis and probability estimation, and identified the intervention focus for individual patients. Thus, the system distinguished coronary artery stenosis well in suspected CHD patients. Personalized probability curves provide individualized intervention guidance. This may reduce the number of invasive inspections in negative patients, while facilitating decision-making regarding appropriate medical intervention, improving patient prognosis.
