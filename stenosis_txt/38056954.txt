Title: [Early Structural Valve Deterioration of Trifecta Aortic Bioprosthesis:Report of a Case].

Abstract: Trifecta, an externally mounted bovine pericardial bioprosthetic aortic valve, provides excellent hemodynamic performance;however, early structural deterioration of this valve has been reported. A 60-year-old man with progressive dyspnea was admitted to the emergency unit of our institution. Seven years prior, he underwent aortic valve replacement with 23-mm Trifecta valve. Severe aortic valve regurgitation and stenosis due to structural valve deterioration was diagnosed and redo aortic valve replacement using an Inspiris valve was performed. Intraoperative findings revealed a large laceration in the left coronary cusp adjacent to the non coronary-left coronary commissure and leaflet calcification. Further, circumferential fibrous pannus ingrowth at the inflow portion was also noted. To avoid anticoagulation therapy and repeat surgery, mitral valve plasty and left atrial appendage clipping were performed simultaneously. Postoperative course was uneventful, and he was transferred to a rehabilitation facility on 36th postoperative day.
