Title: Reoperative Anorectal Procedures in Patients with Anorectal Malformations - Is Bladder Function Affected?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anorectal malformations (ARM) are associated with neurogenic bladder. The traditional surgical ARM repair is a posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP), which is believed to have a minimal effect on bladder dynamics. However, little is known about the effects of reoperative PSARP (rPSARP) on bladder function. We hypothesized that a high rate of bladder dysfunction existed in this cohort.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of ARM patients undergoing rPSARP at a single institution from 2008 to 2015. Only patients with Urology follow-up were included in our analysis. Data was collected regarding original level of ARM, coexisting spinal anomalies and indications for reoperation. We assessed urodynamic variables and bladder management (voiding, CIC or diverted) before and after rPSARP.
RESULTS: A total of 172 patients were identified, of which 85 met inclusion criteria with a median follow-up of 23.9 months (IQR, 5.9-43.8 months). Thirty-six patients had spinal cord anomalies. Indications for rPSARP included mislocation (n = 42), posterior urethral diverticulum (PUD; n = 16), stricture (n = 19) and rectal prolapse (n = 8). Within 1 year following rPSARP, 11 patients (12.9%) had a negative change in bladder management, defined as need for beginning intermittent catheterization or undergoing urinary diversion, which increased to 16 patients (18.8%) at last follow-up. Postoperative bladder management changed in rPSARP patients with mislocation (p < 0.0001) and stricture (p 0.005) but not for rectal prolapse (p 0.143).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who undergo rPSARP warrant especially close attention for bladder dysfunction as we observed a negative postoperative change in bladder management in 18.8% of our series.
