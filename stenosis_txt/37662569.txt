Title: Intraoperative fusion imaging during transcarotid artery revascularization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) with reverse-flow neuroprotection has emerged as an alternative to transfemoral carotid artery stenting and carotid endarterectomy. However, it requires fluoroscopic guidance, exposing the patient and surgeon to radiation. Although fusion-guided endovascular aneurysm repair has been demonstrated to significantly decrease this radiation risk, not much is known about similar outcomes for TCAR. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the outcomes at a single institution using fusion-guided imaging during TCAR compared with regional TCAR cases in the Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) registry without fusion imaging.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of data collected from all patients undergoing TCAR with fusion-guided imaging (TCAR-F) at our hospital and patients undergoing TCAR alone within the VQI database. The primary outcomes included the total operative time, dose area product, fluoroscopy time, contrast usage, and flow-reversal time. The demographics and preoperative risk factors were also assessed in both groups. Continuous outcomes were compared using the Welch t test. Categorical outcomes were compared using the Fisher exact test.
RESULTS: A total of 30 TCAR-F cases (January 2019 to May 2022) at our institution were compared against the regional VQI dataset (n = 2535). The TCAR-F cases had a lower dose area product (5.67 vs 93.1 Gy cm2; P &lt; .0001), shorter fluoroscopy time (8.07 vs 16.4 minutes; P &lt; .0001), and less contrast usage (13.49 vs 76.7 mL; P &lt; .0001) compared with the regional averages of the same. The TCAR-F cases had a longer total operative time (117.3 vs 80.9 minutes; P &lt; .0001) and flow-reversal time (14.4 vs 11.7 minutes; P = .025) compared with the regional cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The results from this pilot study comparing TCAR-F patients at a single institution with VQI regional TCAR patients suggest that TCAR-F cases use less radiation and contrast compared with TCAR without fusion imaging. Fusion-guided imaging might provide radiation protection to both patients and surgeons and decrease contrast usage for the patient.
