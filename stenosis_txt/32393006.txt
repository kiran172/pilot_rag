Title: [Laparoscopic gastroduodenostomy with manual suture for Billroth Ⅰ anastomosis: a report of 36 cases].

Abstract: Objective: To examine the clinical efficiency of laparoscopic gastroduodenostomy with BillrothⅠanastomosis with manual suture. Methods: The clinic data of 36 patients with gastric cancer who underwent laparoscopic gastroduodenostomy with Billroth Ⅰ anastomosis from November 2017 to September 2019 in Department of Gastrointestinal and Pancreatic Surgery, Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital were analyzed retrospectively.There were 22 males and 14 females, aged (64.3±9.3) years(range: 43 to 80 years), underwent complete laparoscopic gastroduodenostomy. The laparoscopic manual suture was used for Billroth Ⅰ anastomosis. Results: All the laparoscopic radical gastrectomy and manual suturing gastroduodenostomy were successfully performed. The operation time was (226.7±40.4) minutes (range: 180 to 320 minutes), including (24.8±7.1) minutes (range: 15 to 48 minutes) for gastroduodenostomy.There was (3.8±0.9) days (range: 2 to 6 days) for anal exhaust, (5.7±2.0) days (range: 3 to 13 days) for extubation of gastric tube, and (10.3±3.1) days (range: 7 to 19 days) for hospitalization. There was no death in perioperative period. Postoperative pathological report showed 3 cases of highly differentiated adenocarcinoma, 5 cases of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, 22 cases of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and 6 cases of signet ring cell carcinoma, including 27 cases in T1 stage and 9 cases in T2 stage. The number of lymph nodes harvested was 36.4±8.9 (range: 23 to 60). Lymph node metastasis was positive in 7 cases and negative in 29 cases. TNM stage included 24 cases in ⅠA stage, 8 cases in ⅠB stage and 4 cases in Ⅱ stage. After the operation, the upper digestive tract radiography showed that the anastomosis opening was unobstructed without complications such as anastomotic stenosis. Conclusion: Laparoscopic gastroduodenostomy with Billroth Ⅰ anastomosis with manual suture is safe and feasible, has a good short-term effect.
