Title: Neurosurgical Evaluation and Management of Adults with Achondroplasia.

Abstract: Much of the current medical discussion for within centers for skeletal dysplasia and specifically patients with achondroplasia focuses on infancy and early childhood. Most neurosurgical concerns arise due to a defect in the endochondral ossification, resulting on early fusion of the synchondrosis. As patients age, the neurosurgical focus shifts from primarily cranial to spinal concerns. Often pediatric neurosurgeons may continue to follow their patients with skeletal dysplasia. However, general adult neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons may see these graduated adults in their practice. This article provides a review of the common neurosurgical concerns for patients with achondroplasia.
