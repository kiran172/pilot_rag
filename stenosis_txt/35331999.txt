Title: De novo arteriovenous malformations in post-thrombotic limbs.

Abstract: A 50-year-old woman presented with progressive, painful and disabling swelling of the left lower limb following a left ovarian cyst excision 2â€‰years ago. She had gross oedema of the left lower limb with multiple pubic varices. Contrast-enhanced CT and digital subtraction imaging revealed diffuse arteriovenous malformation (AVM) with feeders from the left internal iliac artery and a short segment significant stenosis of the proximal left common iliac vein. She underwent angioplasty and stenting of the left iliac vein. Her symptoms dramatically improved following the procedure and her limb swelling regressed within 6 months. The occurrence of post-thrombotic AVMs has been long established in the dural and portal systems. This report deals with an analogous phenomenon following iatrogenic deep venous thrombosis of the left lower limb, its pathogenesis, natural history and a review of treatment options.
