Title: Network Analysis of Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Stenotic Bicuspid Aortic Valves According to Valve Type.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is currently unknown if outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) differ according to the prosthetic valve deployed in patients with bicuspid aortic valves (BAV).
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluated valve-specific outcomes post-TAVR in patients with BAV.
METHODS: Literature search was performed using the Cochrane databases, PubMed, ClinicalTrials, SCOPUS and EMBASE databases from inception until July 2018. We computed risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for all outcomes of interest. For each outcome, the data were pooled using a multivariate random-effects meta-analysis including multiple treatment as well as direct and indirect comparisons.
RESULTS: Ten studies enrolling a total of 1547 BAV patients undergoing TAVR using 6 different prosthetic valve types were analyzed. There were no significant differences in 30-day all-cause mortality, life-threatening bleeding and device success among the diverse prosthetic valve types implanted. However, 2nd generation balloon-expandable valves had consistently lower risk of moderate-to-severe prosthetic valve regurgitation.
CONCLUSION: In patients with BAV, there were no significant differences in 30-day all-cause mortality after TAVR among the various prosthetic valve types.
