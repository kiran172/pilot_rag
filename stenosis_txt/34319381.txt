Title: Colorectal Strictures in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease Do Not Independently Predict Colorectal Neoplasia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Colorectal strictures have been considered independent risk factors for neoplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We examined the association between colorectal stricture and subsequent risk of colorectal neoplasia (CRN) in patients with IBD colitis undergoing colonoscopic surveillance.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of patients with IBD colitis enrolled in colonoscopic surveillance for CRN at an academic medical center between 2005 and 2017. Inclusion criteria were IBD involving the colon for ≥8 years (or any duration with primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC]) undergoing surveillance. Exclusion criteria were advanced CRN (ACRN; colorectal cancer [CRC] or high-grade dysplasia [HGD]) prior to or at enrollment, prior colectomy, or limited (<30%) disease extent or proctitis. Multivariable logistic and Cox regression analysis estimated the association between colorectal stricture on the index colonoscopy and ACRN, CRN (indefinite dysplasia, low-grade dysplasia, HGD, CRC), or colectomy.
RESULTS: Among 789 patients with IBD undergoing CRC surveillance, 72 (9%; 70 with Crohn's colitis) had a colorectal stricture on index colonoscopy. There was no significant difference in the frequency of ACRN or requirement for colectomy between patients with vs without a colorectal stricture (P > .05). Colorectal stricture was not associated with subsequent ACRN (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.41; 95% CI, 0.49-4.07), CRN (aOR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.51-2.58), or colectomy (aOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.65-1.84).
CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of patients with IBD colitis undergoing CRN surveillance, the presence of a colorectal stricture was not independently associated with risk of ACRN or colectomy. Multicenter, prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings, particularly in patients with ulcerative colitis-associated colorectal stricture.
