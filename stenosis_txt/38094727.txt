Title: TAVR Beyond Fetal Viability: An Alternative to Preterm Delivery in Symptomatic Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: A patient with structural valve degeneration of an aortic bioprosthesis with stenosis stage 3 underwent valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at 29 weeks with improvement. This is the first reported TAVR in the third trimester. TAVR may be an alternative to preterm delivery in cases of symptomatic aortic stenosis.
