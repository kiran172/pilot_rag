Title: Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis in Non-Caucasian Women.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To characterize presentation, disease course, and treatment of idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) in non-Caucasian women and compare this cohort to the predominantly female, Caucasian patient cohorts identified in the literature.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. Results are compared to systematic review of demographics.
SETTING: Multiple California institutions from 2008 to 2021.
METHODS: Patients with intubation within 2 years of disease or who met exclusion criteria listed in prior publications were excluded. A systematic review of iSGS patient demographics was also completed for comparison.
RESULTS: Of 421 patients with iSGS, 58 self-identified as non-Caucasian women, with 50 ultimately included. Mean age of onset was 45.1 years old (95% confidence interval [CI], 41.5-48.8), and mean age at diagnosis was 47.2 years (95% CI, 43.6-50.7). Mean Charlson comorbidity index was 1.06 (n = 49, 95% CI, 0.69-1.44). At diagnosis, Cotton-Meyer severity scores (documented in n = 45) were Cotton-Myer (CM) I (28.9%), CM II (40%), and CM III (31.1%). Mean age at first endoscopic surgery was 47.7 (95% CI, 44.2-51.3) years. 64% experienced disease recurrence with a median of 11 months between their first and second surgery. Our systematic review identified 60 studies that reported demographic features in patients with iSGS. 95% of pooled patients were Caucasian, while other demographic features were similar to the current cohort.
CONCLUSION: The non-Caucasian population, almost 14% of this Californian cohort, does not differ from the majority Caucasian population detailed in contemporary literature. This cohort supports the presence of some racial and ethnic heterogeneity in this disease population.
