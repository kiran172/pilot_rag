Title: [Update on the treatment of aortic valve stenosis in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients].

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis is one of the most frequent valvular heart diseases requiring treatment in industrialized countries. The symptom onset is associated with a significantly increased mortality, so that there is a clear indication for treatment in patients with severe, symptomatic aortic valve stenosis; however, data on the optimal treatment of patients with asymptomatic aortic valve stenosis are scarce. Smaller studies in the field of cardiac surgery suggest that early surgical valve replacement is superior to a conservative approach. For this reason, the results of additional adequately powered randomized trials are awaited with great interest. In this year numerous long-term results from randomized comparisons of the two available treatment options (surgical versus transcatheter aortic valve replacement) were published, which will further guide the heart team to find the best treatment approach for each individual.
