Title: Persistent right heart dilatation after percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty: A weird coexistence of iatrogenic and congenital shunts.

Abstract: We present an interesting case of concomitant congenital anomalies with an iatrogenic defect. The female patient underwent a percutaneous mitral balloon valvuloplasty due to rheumatic mitral stenosis. Unfortunately, an iatrogenic atrial septal defect (ASD) transpired during the procedure. Upon post-procedure examination, partial anomalous pulmonary venous (PAPVR) return was observed. The patient was symptomatic; on imaging, dilatation of the right heart chambers were detected. In addition, another crucial point was that the patient was planning a pregnancy, thus robotic surgery for iatrogenic ASD and PAPVR return was recommended. After a successful operation, the patient was asymptomatic and the size of right heart chambers were normalized.
