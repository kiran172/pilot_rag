Title: Computed tomography coronary angiography - past, present and future.

Abstract: Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA) is a robust and reliable non-invasive alternative imaging modality to invasive coronary angiography, which is the reference standard in evaluating the degree of coronary artery stenosis. CTCA has high negative predictive value and can confidently exclude significant coronary artery disease (CAD) in low to intermediate risk patients. Over the years, substantial effort has been made to reduce the radiation dose and increase the cost efficiency of CTCA. In this review, we present the evolution of computed tomography scanners in the context of coronary artery imaging as well as its clinical applications and limitations. We also highlight the future directions of CTCA as a one-stop non-invasive imaging modality for anatomic and functional assessment of CAD.
