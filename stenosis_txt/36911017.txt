Title: Endoscopic percutaneous repair of laryngeal cleft.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe a novel surgical technique of endoscopic percutaneous repair in pediatric patients with type 1, type 2 and type 3 laryngeal cleft (LC).
METHODS: A retrospective study involving 12 patients with LC was performed at a tertiary pediatric hospital between February 2021 and June 2022. Endoscopic percutaneous repair was performed in all the patients. Information such as demographics, comorbidities, history of tracheostomy and the open approach for the repair, type of cleft and complications were analyzed.
RESULTS: Twelve patients were diagnosed with LC. The median age of the patients at the time of surgery was 8.50 months (interquartile range, 49.50 months). Seven patients had tracheomalacia, four patients had subglottic stenosis, three patients had laryngomalacia. No surgical complications occurred in the 10 patients who underwent the primary procedure. For two patients who underwent a secondary procedure, endoscopic percutaneous repair failed again to heal the cleft. During the follow-up period after surgery, none of the patients had stridor, recurrent pneumonia, feeding difficulties, or dyspnea. Follow-up modified barium swallow postoperatively demonstrated no aspiration in 10 patients. Only the 2 patients with a secondary procedure had intermittent cough while taking large gulps of water. The cure rate of endoscopic percutaneous repairer was 83.3% (95% confidence interval: 73.9%-92.8%).
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic percutaneous repair should be considered as an alternative to the open transcervical approach and the traditional endoscopic approach for type 1, type 2 and type 3 LC.
