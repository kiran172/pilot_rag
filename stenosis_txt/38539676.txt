Title: Adventitia Layer-Focused Microsurgical Flow Reconstruction for Long-Segment Tubular Stenosis of the Cervical Segment (C1) Internal Carotid Artery: Clinical Valuable Experience in 20 Cases.

Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy of perivascular sympathectomy in managing adventitia layer-related long-segment tubular stenosis of cervical segment (C1) internal carotid arteries (ICAs) in a cohort where conventional medical and endovascular interventions were not viable options, we retrospectively analyzed 20 patients (8 males, 12 females, aged 41-63 years) who underwent perivascular sympathectomy for long-segment (>5 cm) tubular cervical ICA stenosis (non-atherosclerotic, non-intima related, and nondolichoarteriopathic) between 2017 and 2023. The procedure aimed to alleviate symptoms such as hemiparesis, pulsatile tinnitus, and migraines associated with transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). Preoperative and postoperative symptoms were assessed, and patient follow-up was conducted by MR angiography and perfusion studies. Postoperatively, 10 out of 11 migraine sufferers (90.9%) reported complete cessation of symptoms, while one patient (9.09%) experienced reduction in frequency and intensity. In cases of tinnitus, six out of nine patients (66.6%) reported complete resolution, two (22.2%) had reduced symptoms, and one (11.1%) saw no change. Regarding motor function, all 12 patients (100%) with initial hemiparesis (30-40% loss of motor function) showed complete recovery postoperatively. There was no TIA attack among the patients after the procedure in the mean two-year follow-up. Perivascular sympathectomy has shown promising results in alleviating symptoms and preventing recurrent cerebrovascular events in long-segment tubular stenosis of cervical ICAs.
