Title: Long-term laryngological sequelae and patient-reported outcomes after COVID-19 infection.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We examine prevalence, characteristics, quality of life (QOL) assessments, and long-term effects of interventions for laryngeal dysfunction after recovery from COVID-19 infection.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: 653 patients presenting to Yale's COVID clinic from April 2020 to August 2021 were identified retrospectively. Patients with PCR-positive COVID-19 who underwent evaluation by fellowship-trained laryngologists were included. Patient demographics, comorbidities, intubation/tracheostomy, strobolaryngoscopy, voice metrics, and management data were collected. Patient-reported QOL indices were Dyspnea Index (DI), Cough Severity Index (CSI), Voice Handicap Index-10 (VHI-10), Eating Assessment Tool-10 (EAT-10), and Reflux Symptom Index (RSI).
RESULTS: 57 patients met inclusion criteria: 37 (64.9 %) were hospitalized for COVID-19 infection and 24 (42.1 %) required intubation. Mean duration between COVID-19 diagnosis and presentation to laryngology was significantly shorter for patients who were intubated compared to non-intubated (175 ± 98 days versus 256 ± 150 days, respectively, p = 0.025). Dysphonia was diagnosed in 40 (70.2 %) patients, dysphagia in 14 (25.0 %) patients, COVID-related laryngeal hypersensitivity in 13 (22.8 %), and laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) in 10 (17.5 %) patients. Of the 17 patients who underwent voice therapy, 11 (64.7 %) reported improvement in their symptoms and 2 (11.8 %) patients reported resolution. VHI scores decreased for patients who reported symptom improvement. 7 (70 %) patients with LTS required >1 procedural intervention before symptom improvement. Improvement across QOL indices was seen in patients with LTS.
CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal dysfunction commonly presents and is persistent for months after recovery from COVID-19 in non-hospitalized and non-intubated patients. Voice therapy and procedural interventions have the potential to address post-COVID laryngeal dysfunction.
