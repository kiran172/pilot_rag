Title: Pelvic Fracture Urethral Distraction Defects in Preschool Boys: How to Recognize and Manage?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To share the cases of pelvic fracture urethral distraction defect (PFUDD) in preschool boys and evaluate the transperineal anastomotic urethroplasty strategy for the treatment of these cases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between January 2010 and May 2021, 8 preschool boys (<6 years) with PFUDD underwent the transperineal anastomotic urethroplasty in our center were retrospectively reviewed. Etiology was traumatic pelvic fracture in all boys. The type of trauma included: fall injury in 1 and vehicle crush injury in 7. Urethroplasty was performed at least 3 months after initial trauma or the last failed intervention. One of them suffered from PFUDD associated with urethrorectal fistula received urethroplasty combined with fistula repair. A successful urethroplasty was defined as restoring the patency and continuity of urethra and no further interventions were needed.
RESULTS: Follow-up was obtained in all the 8 preschool boys for 3-135 (median: 65) months. The average age was 4.1 years old (range 1-5). After operation, the final success rate was 100%. Neither stenosis recurrence nor urinary fistulas were reported during follow-up. Of the 8 boys, 1 developed urinary incontinence, only occurring after high-intensity exercise such as running. Potency state could not be evaluated for all boys due to the young age. One boy reported having normal morning erection after a follow-up of 135 months.
CONCLUSION: PFUDD in preschool boys is a challenge for both the urologist and parent. Our study preliminarily confirmed that the progressive anastomotic urethroplasty strategy can ensure a high success rate.
