Title: Paediatric Takayasu's arteritis complicated by thrombotic occlusion of the distal thoracic aorta.

Abstract: We present the case of a 1-year-old girl with mid-aortic syndrome due to untreated Takayasu's arteritis who developed cardiogenic shock. Enhanced computed tomography revealed long-segment occlusion of the distal thoracic aorta. We successfully performed graft interpose (10â€‰mm in diameter) under cardiopulmonary bypass through both median sternotomy and left posterolateral thoracotomy. The thrombus was relatively small and the distal thoracic aorta was narrow over a long segment due to severely thickened intima. Follow-up computed tomography showed widely patent graft without a stenotic region in the abdominal aorta or its branches. The patient discharged ambulatory without major complications.
