Title: Early Tibial Vessel Recoil Following Treatment With the Bare Temporary Spur Stent System: Results From the DEEPER OUS Vessel Recoil Substudy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Vessel recoil is a common phenomenon occurring in the tibial vessels following balloon angioplasty. This study examined the occurrence and short-term impact of acute vessel recoil in a subset of patients treated with retrievable scaffold therapy (RST) via the Spur Peripheral Retrievable Scaffold System (Spur).
METHODS: Patients with tibial disease underwent angiography immediately following RST, and then 15 minutes post-treatment. Vessel recoil was defined as a ≥10% decrease in lumen diameter after 15 minutes. Recoil was further analyzed by late lumen loss method, subsegmental late lumen loss method, and smallest segment to same segment method. Patient and vessel characteristics were evaluated. Functional recoil (acute vessel spasm), defined as no significant change in minimal lumen diameter (MLD) at baseline compared with 15 minutes post-treatment, was also evaluated.
RESULTS: Of the 38 patients (40 lesions; 33 men [87%]; mean [SD] age 75.3 [8.2] years; 26 (68.4%) with diabetes mellitus); recoil was noted in 42.5% of vessels. Prior to treatment, 13 lesions (32.5%) were total occlusions, the mean lesion length was 64.7±30.4 mm, and 27.5% (11/40) were moderate or severely calcified. Mean treated lesion length was 97.8±39.6 mm. For lesions evaluable by duplex ultrasound, 86.7% of vessels (26/30) were patent at 6 months. There was no significant difference in patency between lesions with recoil and lesions without recoil (81.8% vs 89.5%); there was a trend toward patency in the non-recoil group. Two lesions had functional recoil (acute vessel spasm) and were patent at 6 months. There was no statistically significant correlation of recoil to comorbidities or lesion characteristics, including calcification, for which there was also no correlation to patency.
CONCLUSION: Vessel recoil was noted in 42.5% of vessels treated with RST, whereas previous published rates with balloon angioplasty demonstrated vessel recoil up to 97%, suggesting that RST may impact vessel recoil. This exploratory study did not demonstrate a correlation between vessel recoil and patency at 6 months.
CLINICAL IMPACT: Retrievable scaffold therapy may replace scoring devices and cutting devices for vessel preparation before definite (drug) therapy. Retrievable scaffold therapy supplements already established vessel preparation strategies in order to follow the concept of leaving nothing behaind. A temporary retrievable scaffold for changing vessel compliance and potentially releasing antiproliferative drugs represents a new interventional concept.
