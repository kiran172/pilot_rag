Title: The Enterprise stent…still useful after all these years.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Enterprise stent (Codman Neuro, Massachusetts, USA) received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval in 2007 for stent-assisted coiling (SAC). Since its introduction, newer stents and devices for aneurysm treatment have been developed resulting in a shift in the utilization of this stent from SAC to other off-label indications.
OBJECTIVE: To describe our experience with the Enterprise stent being used for SAC and other off-label indications.
METHODS: This is a multi-center retrospective review of the use of the Enterprise stent between 2018 and 2023. All patients in which the Enterprise stent was successfully deployed were included in the study.
RESULTS: Our study cohort comprised of 194 patients, mostly females (n = 112, 57.7%), with a mean age of 63.2 years ± 14.3. The Enterprise stent was used for SAC in only 24 (12.4%) patients and was used for rescue stenting in stroke in 101 patients (52.1%), treatment of intracranial stenosis in 53 patients (27.3%), treatment of in-stent stenosis in 1 patient (0.5%), and for treatment of dissections in 15 patients (7.7%). From 2018 to 2023, the use of Enterprise stents for SAC significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.0001) while the use of Enterprise stents for non-SAC purposes was insignificantly variable (p = 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that the Enterprise stent remains a reliable tool in neuroendovascular procedures, even if its original intended use has been supplanted by other devices.
