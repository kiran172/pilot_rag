Title: Paclitaxel-induced acute myocardial infarction: a case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Paclitaxel is a chemotherapeutic agent commonly used for ovarian, lung, breast carcinoma, and Kaposi's sarcoma. Its common side effects include hypersensitivity reaction, bone marrow suppression, and peripheral neuropathy. However, a rare and life-threatening side effect is paclitaxel-induced myocardial infarction.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 71-year-old man with type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heavy smoking history, previous coronary artery disease with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in left anterior descending artery (LAD), and non-small lung cancer presented with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction during infusion of paclitaxel infusion. Coronary angiogram showed de novo three vessel disease with 70% stenosis in ostial to distal left main artery (LM) and 80% in-stent re-stenosis in proximal to mid left anterior descending artery.
CONCLUSIONS: Physicians should be keeping this in mind when dealing with patients on paclitaxel, especially if they have previous risk factors for coronary artery disease.
