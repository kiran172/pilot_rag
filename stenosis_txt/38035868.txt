Title: Image-guided high-dose-rate brachytherapy as the method of choice in medically inoperable early-stage endometrial cancer patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: About 3-9% of patients with endometrial cancer are unable to undergo surgery due to medical comorbidities, including morbid obesity, or age-related frailty syndrome. An alternative curative option is irradiation. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate clinical outcomes of high-dose-rate intracavitary brachytherapy (HDR-ICBT) treatment in such patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seventy-eight patients with FIGO stage I-II endometrial cancer disqualified from surgery were treated with HDR-ICBT with 45-52,5 Gy prescribed to high-risk clinical target volume (HR-CTV) in 5-9 fractions given once a week. All fractions were planned using computed tomography (CT) scans.
RESULTS: The median follow-up time was 67 months. Median age was 79 years (range: 42-93 years). Median body mass index (BMI) was 39,1 kg/m2 (range: 24,2-68 kg/m2). We observed no statistically significant impact of BMI ≥ 40 on overall survival (OS) or prgression free survival (PFS). The 3- and 5-year OS for the whole population were 69% and 55%, respectively. The impact of high risk features (FIGO II, grade 3 or type 2 cancer) on OS was significant (p = 0,049). The 5-year cumulative incidence of local failure, distant metastases and non-cancer death were 12,9% [95% CI: 5,4%-20,5%], 6,4% [95% CI: 0,9%-11,9%], 33,1% [95% CI: 22,3%-43,9%], respectively. The 5-year risk of cancer and non-cancer death were 9% (95% CI: 3%-16%) and 36% (95% CI: 25%-47%), respectively. We observed G1 vaginal apex stenosis only.
CONCLUSIONS: CT-guided HDR-ICBT is a feasible and safe management of FIGO stage I endometrial cancer in obese and elderly patients. The survival outcome of the treated group is influenced more by associated comorbidities than by the progression of endometrial cancer.
