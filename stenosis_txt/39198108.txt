Title: Enhancing acute stroke assessment: evaluating the clinical utility of the "Real" one-stop-shop scan protocol combining brain computed tomography perfusion and head-and-neck computed tomography angiography using a 512-slice detector computed tomography scanner.

Abstract: AIM: To assess the efficiency and diagnostic value of the "real" one-stop-shop protocol integrating the computed tomography angiography (CTA) sequence of the head and neck into the computed tomography perfusion (CTP) acquisition using a 512-slice detector CT scanner in patients who suffered from acute ischemic stroke.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study included 100 patients suspected of acute ischemic stroke. The patients were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n=50) who underwent the traditional protocol (brain CTP and head-and-neck CTA examination separately) and the experimental group (n=50) who underwent a one-stop-shop protocol (combined brain CT perfusion and head-and-neck CTA, the CTA triggering time determined by a low-dose test bolus injection). The examination time, contrast-agent dosage, radiation dose, postprocessing time, and image quality were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the experimental group had a significantly lower total iodine contrast-agent dosage (80 vs. 100 ml, P<0.001) and shorter scan time (3.23 [3.13, 3.35] vs. 2.32 [2.17, 2.45] min, P<0.001). Additionally, the radiation dose exposure was lower in the experimental group than in the control group (5129.00 [5173, 5232] vs. 4681.35 [4555.12, 4822.95] mGy-cm, P<0.001). No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups in terms of postprocessing time, head-and-neck CTA, and CTP imaging quality.
CONCLUSION: The one-stop-shop protocol enables effective detection of lesions, providing clear visualization of the location and degree of stenosis in the head-and-neck vessels. It achieves this with lower costs in scan time, contrast-agent dosage, and radiation dose compared to the traditional protocol and is thus worth considering as the first examination for patients who suffer from acute ischemic stroke.
