Title: Anastomotic Configuration and Temporary Diverting Ileostomy Do Not Increase Risk of Anastomotic Stricture in Postoperative Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Surgical management of Crohn's disease (CD) is common. Postoperative complications include anastomotic stricturing (AS). The natural history and risk factors for AS have not been elucidated.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of patients with CD who underwent ileocolonic resection (ICR) with â‰¥1 postoperative ileocolonoscopy between 2009 and 2020. Postoperative ileocolonoscopies with corresponding cross-sectional imaging were evaluated for evidence of AS without neoterminal ileal extension. Severity of AS and endoscopic intervention at time of detection were collected. Primary outcome was development of AS. Secondary outcome was time to AS detection.
RESULTS: A total of 602 adult patients with CD underwent ICR with postoperative ileocolonoscopy. Of these, 426 had primary anastomosis, and 136 had temporary diversion at time of ICR. Anastomotic configuration consisted of 308 side-to-side, 148 end-to-side, and 136 end-to-end. One hundred ten (18.3%) patients developed AS with median time of 3.2 years to AS detection. AS severity at time of detection was associated with need for repeat surgical resection for AS. On multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, anastomotic configuration and temporary diversion were not associated with risk of or time to AS. Preoperative stricturing disease was associated with decreased time to AS (adjusted hazard ratio 1.8; P = 0.049). Endoscopic ileal recurrence before AS was not associated with subsequent AS detection.
DISCUSSION: AS is a relatively common postoperative CD complication. Patients with previous stricturing disease behavior are at increased risk of AS. Anastomotic configuration, temporary diversion, and ileal CD recurrence do not increase risk of AS. Early detection and intervention for AS may help prevent progression to repeat ICR.
