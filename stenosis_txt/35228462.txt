Title: [Evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics using arterial spin labeling perfusion MR imaging in a patient with cervical internal carotid artery vasospasm].

Abstract: 57-year-old woman with sequelae of cerebral infarction was admitted to our hospital because her left-sided hemiparesis was worsened. The right internal carotid artery (ICA) was not visualized by carotid duplex sonography and brain MRA. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) perfusion MR images showed reduced signals in the bilateral ICA territories at post labeling delay 1,525Â ms. Her neurological symptoms improved on the day after hospitalization. On day 3, the bilateral ICAs were well visualized on MRA, while cerebral perfusion in the ICA territories appeared to be normalized on ASL. We diagnosed cervical ICA vasospasm, based on the findings of cervical MRA and cerebral angiography. Three months later, the recurrence of ICA vasospasm occurred. ASL was useful for the serial non-invasive evaluation of cerebral hemodynamics from the onset to improvement in a patient with ICA vasospasm.
