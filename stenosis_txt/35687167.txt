Title: Life-threatening idiopathic intracranial hypertension: the role of venous sinus stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a clinical syndrome characterised by raised intracranial pressure with no discernible aetiology. It is relatively rare in children and its demographic features may differ from those of adults. The relationship between IIH and venous sinus stenosis (VSS) is well known. As VSS plays an important role in the pathophysiology, treatments have been developed aimed at improving venous blood outflow in refractory IIH. In the last two decades, venous sinus stenting has emerged as a treatment option in cases where stenosis is documented.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The scientific literature on paediatric cases of IIH and its treatment with venous sinus stenting was analysed. We present the case of a 6-year-old girl with a life-threatening presentation of IIH, who was treated with transverse sinus stenting and a lumboperitoneal shunt. We summarise the characteristic of paediatric stenting cases reported and review the literature focusing on the main aspects of venous sinus stenting.
CONCLUSION: VSS stenting could be a treatment tool for the acute presentation of IIH with severe symptoms and VSS plus an elevated trans-stenotic pressure gradient. However, in some cases, additional surgical treatment may be necessary.
