Title: Percutaneous Transluminal Renal Angioplasty for Fibromuscular Dysplasia and Prognostic Risk Factors: A Retrospective Chinese Cohort Study.

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory vascular disease involving small-to-medium-sized arteries. The characteristics of Chinese patients with FMD remain unclear. We retrospectively analyzed the data of patients with renal FMD who underwent percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) for the first time at Fuwai Hospital between 2010 and 2021. The variables were selected through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO), and logistic regression models were constructed to identify independent risk factors. A total of 116 patients (52 males, median age at diagnosis, 25.0 years) were enrolled. Elevated blood pressure was the leading complaint. After a median follow-up period of 18.0 months (interquartile range: 6.0-48.0 months), hypertension recurred in 34 patients and restenosis in nine patients, among whom four patients underwent secondary intervention and one patient underwent surgical revascularization. Bilateral renal artery involvement (odds ratio [OR]: 2.61, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-6.15; p = 0.028) and age at hypertension onset (OR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99; p = 0.018) were independent prognostic factors for adverse outcomes. The results indicate that patients with bilateral renal artery involvement and younger age at hypertension onset are more likely to have poorer clinical outcomes after PTRA, and should be more closely monitored.
