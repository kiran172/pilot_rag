Title: Lipoprotein(a) and aortic valve stenosis: A casual or causal association?

Abstract: AIMS: This review aims to provide an update of available methods for imaging calcification activity and potential therapeutic options.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Aortic valve calcification represents the most common heart valve condition requiring treatment among adults in Western societies. No medical therapies are proven to be effective in treating symptoms or reducing disease progression. Therefore, surgical or transcatheter aortic valve replacement remains the only available treatment option. Elevated circulating concentrations of lipoprotein(a) is strongly associated with degenerative aortic stenosis. This relationship was first observed in prospective observational studies, and the causal relationship was confirmed in genetic studies.
CONCLUSIONS: New therapeutic targets have been identified and new imaging techniques could be used to test the effectiveness of new agents and further clarify the pathophysiology of AVS. No therapy that specifically lowers Lp (a) levels has been approved for clinical use.
