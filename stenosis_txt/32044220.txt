Title: Poststroke Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Recurrent Stroke in Patients With Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cognitive impairment occurs in 20%-40% of stroke patients and is a predictor of long-term morbidity and mortality. In this study, we aim to determine the association between poststroke cognitive impairment and stroke recurrence risk, in patients with anterior versus posterior circulation intracranial stenosis.
METHODS: This is a post-hoc analysis of the Stenting and Aggressive Medical Therapy for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial. The primary predictor was poststroke cognitive function measured by Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) at 3-6 months and the primary outcome was recurrent ischemic stroke. We used univariate and multivariable cox-regression models to determine the associations between MOCA at 3-6 months and recurrent stroke.
RESULTS: Of the 451 patients enrolled in SAMMPRIS, 393 patients met the inclusion criteria. The mean age of the sample (in years) was 59.5 ± 11.3, 62.6% (246 of 393) were men. Fifty patients (12.7%) had recurrent ischemic stroke during a mean follow up of 2.7 years. The 3-6 month MOCA score was performed on 351 patients. In prespecified multivariable models, there was an association between 3 and 6 month MOCA and recurrent stroke (hazard ratio [HR] per point increase .93 95% confidence interval [CI] .88-.99, P = .040). This effect was present in anterior circulation stenosis (adjusted HR per point increase .92 95% CI .85-0.99, P = .022) but not in posterior circulation artery stenosis (adjusted HR per point increase 1.00 95% .86-1.16, P = .983).
CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we found weak associations and trends between MoCA at 3-6 months and stroke recurrence but more notable and stronger associations in certain subgroups. Since our study is underpowered, larger studies are needed to validate our findings and determine the mechanism(s) behind this association.
