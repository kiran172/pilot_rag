Title: Management of severe low back pain with a focused vibro-percussion wave treatment: A case report.

Abstract: A 49-year-old male with severe low back pain (LBP) showed multilevel disc bulges with spinal stenosis. After 18 novel low-frequency sound wave treatments, initial VAS pain score of 9.5 reduced to 2.5 and the Rolland-Morris score of 13 reduced to 3. MRI showed some resolution of L3-L4 and L4-L5.
