Title: The Role of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance in Aortic Stenosis and Regurgitation.

Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is a well-set diagnostic technique for assessment of valvular heart diseases and is gaining ground in current clinical practice. It provides high-quality images without the administration of ionizing radiation and occasionally without the need of contrast agents. It offers the unique possibility of a comprehensive stand-alone assessment of the heart including biventricular function, left ventricle remodeling, myocardial fibrosis, and associated valvulopathies. CMR is the recognized reference for the quantification of ventricular volumes, mass, and function. A particular strength is the ability to quantify flow, especially with new techniques which allow accurate measurement of stenosis and regurgitation. Furthermore, tissue mapping enables the visualization and quantification of structural changes in the myocardium. In this way, CMR has the potential to yield important prognostic information predicting those patients who will progress to surgery and impact outcomes. In this review, the fundamentals of CMR in assessment of aortic valve diseases (AVD) are described, together with its strengths and weaknesses. This state-of-the-art review provides an updated overview of CMR potentials in all AVD issues, including valve anatomy, flow quantification, ventricular volumes and function, and tissue characterization.
