Title: Endoscopic biliary drainage using a 4-Fr catheter for biliary obstruction: a pilot study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Stent or endoscopic nasobiliary drainage (ENBD) catheter placement for a tight, complicated biliary stricture is still technically challenging. A thin, 4-Fr ENBD catheter (4-Fr catheter) has been developed to overcome this difficulty. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of the 4-Fr catheter for endoscopic biliary drainage (EBD).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 51 patients who underwent EBD with the 4-Fr catheter because placement of a conventional drainage catheter (CDC) had failed.
RESULTS: The success rate of 4-Fr catheter placement was 96.1% (49/51). The median patency period of the catheter was 114â€‰days (95% CI, 53-200). Among the 49 patients with successful placement of the catheter, adverse events occurred in five (10.2%) patients: post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pancreatitis (PEP), two patients; catheter dislocation, one patient; and kinking of the 4-Fr catheter, two patients. Both cases of PEP improved with conservative treatment, but all cases of catheter dislocation and kinking required reintervention with a 4-Fr catheter. Forty-three (87.8%) patients achieved clinical remission after EBD with a 4-Fr catheter.
CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed 4-Fr catheter is safe and feasible for EBD in patients in whom CDC placement is difficult due to a tight, complicated biliary stricture.
