Title: Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection With Intact Atrial Septum: Early and Midterm Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return with intact atrial septum warrants greater understanding and evaluation in the literature.
METHODS: From January 1993 to December 2018, 293 patients with partial anomalous pulmonary venous return underwent surgical repair. Of these, 45 patients (15.3%) had an intact atrial septum. The median age was 36 years (interquartile range, 24-48). Direct reimplantation was used in 17 patients (38%), intracardiac baffling in 15 (33%), and caval division (Warden) technique in 13 (29%). Descriptive statistics were used to assess the data, and Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess survival.
RESULTS: Anomalous veins were right-sided in 27 patients (60%), left-sided in 16 patients (36%), and bilateral in 2 patients (4%). The insertion sites were the superior vena cava in 23 patients (51%), innominate vein in 12 (27%), inferior vena cava in 6 (13%), coronary sinus in 2 (4%), right atrium in 1 patient (2%), and unknown in 1 patient (2%). Scimitar syndrome was noted in 8 patients (18%). There was no postoperative mortality or residual defects. Postoperative echocardiography excluded any obstruction of pulmonary or systemic veins. Postoperative complications included atrial fibrillation in 9 patients (20%) and pneumothorax requiring chest tube in 5 patients (11%). Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 100%, 95%, and 95%, respectively. Two patients underwent pulmonary vein dilation, one at 3 years and the other at 7 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical repair of partial anomalous pulmonary venous connection with intact atrial septum can be performed with excellent early and midterm outcomes. The overall incidence of midterm systemic or pulmonary vein stenosis is low.
