Title: Successful non-invasive imaging of the coronary artery IMT in pediatric patients with Kawasaki disease using high-resolution echocardiography.

Abstract: Kawasaki Disease (KD) is a multisystemic vasculitis of medium- and small-sized arteries. Abnormal intimal thickening may develop in the involved arterial area after regression of coronary artery aneurysm (CAA). Intimal dysfunction may induce local stenosis or arteriosclerosis in the future. In this case-control study, we investigated 29 consecutive KD patients [20 male, median current age, 7.9 years; median follow-up duration, 5.7 years] and a group of 29 healthy matched controls (CON) [19 male, median current age, 10.8 years]. They were assesed and compared for CAA, LVFS, GCS, GLS, coronary artery (CA) Z scores, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and coronary artery IMT by high-resolution transthoracic echocardiography (hrTTE). Coronary artery IMT (caIMT) was significantly higher in patients with a maximal CA Z score > 2.5 in acute KD than in CON: KD caIMT: 0.62 mm [IQR, 0.57-0.72 mm] vs. 0.53 mm [0.51-0.60 mm], p = 0.043. CAAs were found in 15 (51.7%) patients with acute KD. The maximal median LCA Z score in acute KD was 2.57z [IQR, 1.93-3.2z] and in follow-up -0.39z [IQR, -1.25 to -0.36z]. There was no significant difference in carotid IMT between KD patients and CON. Signs of CA intima-media thickening were detected by hrTTE in patients with a maximal CA Z score > 2.5 in acute KD. These data indicate that these patients may be at risk for cardiovascular sequale even in the absence of permanent CA luminal abnormalities. Therefore long-term follow-up of this group of KD patients may be required.
