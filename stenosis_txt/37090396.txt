Title: Currarino Syndrome Presenting in Adulthood: A Rare Case.

Abstract: Currarino syndrome or Currarino triad is a complex condition consisting of congenital anomalies. The triad consists of anterior sacral mass (meningocele, teratoma or dermoid/epidermoid cyst), sacral bone defect (hypoplasia, agenesis ), anorectal malformation/congenital anorectal stenosis.Â This condition is named after Dr Guido Currarino, an Italian-American paediatric radiologist, who first described it in 1975. This needs a multidisciplinary treatment approach. We describe a case of successfully managed young adult with Currarino syndrome. The latest artificial intelligence tool, Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (ChatGPT), helped to write this case report.
