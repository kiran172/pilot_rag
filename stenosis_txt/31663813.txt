Title: A Qualitative Study of Preparation for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Surgery: Perceptions of Patients and Physical Therapists.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To gain the perspectives of patients who underwent lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) surgery and physical therapists who treat spine-related disorders regarding rehabilitation and other care prior to LSS surgery.
DESIGN: Qualitative focus group study.
METHODS: Sixteen patients (4 female; average ± SD age, 64.3 ± 8.8 years; time since surgery, 9.9 ± 4.4 months) and 10 physical therapists (2 female; average ± SD age, 40.9 ± 6.6 years; time in practice, 17.2 ± 7.7 years) participated. Four groups were conducted: 2 with patients post LSS surgery and 2 with physical therapists who treat spine-related disorders. Participants were asked open-ended questions by a trained facilitator regarding their perceptions of preoperative LSS education and rehabilitation. Transcripts were coded and themes were identified.
RESULTS: Analyses revealed 4 themes within the discussions: (1) desire for helpful information, (2) benefits of preoperative rehabilitation, (3) downfalls of preoperative rehabilitation, and (4) desire for coordinated care. Varying opinions on preoperative physical therapy between patients and physical therapists were discussed, revealing that similar numbers of participants held positive and negative perceptions of preoperative physical therapy. A desire for more thorough preoperative education and care was expressed by both groups.
CONCLUSION: There is a clear need for standardized preoperative LSS care and education. This may decrease misunderstandings about LSS surgery and its treatments in the future as well as improve coordinated care between surgeons and physical therapists.
