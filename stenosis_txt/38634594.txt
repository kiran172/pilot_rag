Title: [Complicated gastric cancer and modern treatment approaches].

Abstract: Among all patients with gastric cancer, 40% admit to the hospitals due to cancer-related complications. The most common complications of gastric cancer are bleeding (22-80%), malignant gastric outlet obstruction (26-60%), and perforation (less than 5%). The main treatment methods for gastric cancer complicated by bleeding are various forms of endoscopic hemostasis, transarterial embolization and external beam radiotherapy. Surgical treatment is possible in case of ineffective management. However, surgical algorithm is not standardized. Malignant gastric outlet stenosis requires decompression: endoscopic stenting, palliative gastroenterostomy. Surgical treatment is also possible (gastrectomy, proximal or distal resection of the stomach). The main problem for patients with complicated gastric cancer is the lack of standardized algorithms and abundance of potential surgical techniques. The aim of our review is to systematize available data on the treatment of complicated gastric cancer and to standardize existing methods.
