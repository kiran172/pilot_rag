Title: Free-floating thrombus in lower limb deep veins and May-Thurner syndrome: case report.

Abstract: Free-floating thrombus in the deep venous system has a high potential to cause pulmonary embolization. It can also be found in patients with superficial venous thrombosis (SVT) that extends to a deep vein. There are still no defined criteria for treatments described in the literature, which range from anticoagulation and fibrinolytic treatments with vena cava filter implants, through open or endovascular thrombectomies, to more invasive procedures such as surgical interruption with ligation of the venous system. We present the case of a patient with extensive deep venous thrombosis affecting the iliofemoral-popliteal territory with a floating thrombus extending from the left common iliac vein to the inferior vena cava. Treatment was performed with fibrinolytic therapy delivered with a multiperforated catheter, supplemented with anticoagulation with heparin and daily control angiography. At the end of the treatment, a significant stenosis was identified in the left common iliac vein, and angioplasty was performed with stenting.
