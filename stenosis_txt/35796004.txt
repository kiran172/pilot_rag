Title: Endoscopic versus fluoroscopic esophageal dilatations in children with esophageal strictures: 10-year experience.

Abstract: Esophageal strictures in children may cause dysphagia, choking during feeds, and failure to thrive. They can be treated by balloon dilatations, either under endoscopic or fluoroscopic guidance; there is no literature comparing the methods. Retrospective review of the medical records of children (0-18 years) who were treated with balloon dilatations between 2010 and 2020. The primary outcome was the number of dilatation sessions required until clinical success after 3 months. Secondary outcomes were long-term success at 12 months, and complications of bleeding and perforation. Forty-six patients underwent 174 dilatation sessions. Success rates in the endoscopy and fluoroscopy groups were similar: 62% versus 67% (p = 0.454) at 3 months and 57% versus 67% (p = 0.721) at 12 months. Complication rate was lower in the endoscopy group (0% vs. 15%, p < 0.001). Both endoscopic and radiologic-guided balloon dilatations were shown to be equally effective, but endoscopic guidance had fewer complications.
