Title: Rapidly Progressive Stenosis of the Left Main Trunk Ostium Starting 21 Months After Stent Implantation.

Abstract: Rapidly progressive in-stent restenosis (ISR) after stent deployment from the left main trunk (LMT) to the left anterior descending artery (LAD) without plaque at the LMT ostium has not been reported. A 60-year-old Japanese man with a history of scleroderma, pulmonary fibrosis, and type 2 diabetes developed acute myocardial infarction of the right coronary artery (RCA) and was treated by emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for RCA. Nine days later he underwent PCI from the LMT to the LAD. Follow-up coronary angiography (CAG) at 9 and 21 months post-PCI did not reveal ISR in any lesion, but the patient experienced cardiac arrest at 25 months post-PCI. Emergency CAG after resuscitation revealed ISR of the LMT ostium; emergency PCI was conducted. The development of ISR at the ostium of the LMT although the patient was free of plaque 4 months before is extremely unusual. This rare ISR of the LMT ostium progressed rapidly after follow-up CAG revealed no ISR at 21 months post-stent implantation.
