Title: Early Start of Infliximab in Crohn's Disease Increases Rates of Endoscopic Remission and Decreases Stenosis Formation: Experiences From a Single Center Cohort.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Over 10 years ago, the step-up/top-down trial demonstrated favorable outcomes of Crohn's disease (CD) after early initiation of infliximab (IFX) in patients with CD. However, data on long-term effects of this treatment strategy in daily clinical practice are scarce.
METHODS: This retrospective study investigated effects of early (<24 months after diagnosis) versus late intervention (>24 months) of IFX in CD on endoscopic remission (ER) rates, surgery rates, and course of CD, long term.
RESULTS: Overall, 242 CD patients (94 early, 148 late intervention) were started on IFX and followed for 24 months. Sixty-one patients with early and 86 with late intervention underwent endoscopy after start of IFX. After IFX induction, 90.3% of patients with early versus 87.8% with late intervention were in clinical remission (P = .676), compared to 89.1% versus 85.8% after 24 months (P = .554). Almost half of patients with early IFX (45.9%, n = 28/61) achieved ER within 24 months compared to only one forth with late IFX intervention (25.6%, n = 22/86, P = .013). In addition, significantly less patients with early IFX intervention (9.8%, n = 6/61) developed intestinal stenosis during 24 months follow-up compared to late IFX start (29.1%, n = 25/86, P = .007). Logistic regression revealed early IFX intervention as only relevant factor achieving ER with an odds ratio of 2.386 (95% confidence interval [1.1180; 4.825], P = .016).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data on early IFX therapy in CD support early IFX intervention with more patients achieving ER, and less patients developing stricturing disease behavior. Early IFX intervention could therefore change the course of CD.
