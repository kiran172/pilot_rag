Title: Giant subaortic left ventricular diverticulum with aortic regurgitation and stenosis.

Abstract: A subaortic left ventricular diverticulum (SLVD) represents an extremely rare congenital anomaly. It can be asymptomatic but sometimes develops fatal complications. Treatment has been debated due to limited experience. We present the successful treatment of a giant SLVD with aortic regurgitation and stenosis and ascending aorta dilatation. Our goal is to improve understanding of this rare entity.
