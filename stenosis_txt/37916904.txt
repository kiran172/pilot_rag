Title: Carotid endarterectomy for the management of carotid stenosis occurring concurrently with head and neck cancer.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Currently, most patients with concurrent head and neck cancer (HNC) and carotid stenosis (CS) are treated disjointedly for their oncologic and vascular lesions. The purpose of this review is to evaluate literature exploring a novel approach to these cases that poses several advantages, in which carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is performed simultaneously with surgical resection of HNC.
RECENT FINDINGS: Carotid stenosis is a common comorbidity of patients presenting with head and neck cancer as these pathologies have overlapping risk factors. Adjuvant oncologic therapy such as radiation therapy to the site of the lesion is known to increase development or progression of carotid stenosis. Performing simultaneous surgical management of CS and HNC decreases total procedures for the patient, provides a less challenging surgical field, and eliminates prioritization of treatment initiation for one pathology over the other. There has been limited reporting of simultaneous CEA with oncologic resection of HNC in the literature. However, of the 21 cases reviewed here, no perioperative strokes were reported with only one perioperative death from myocardial infarction.
SUMMARY: Available literature supports that simultaneous CEA with oncologic resection of HNC is safe and may offer several advantages, although larger studies are required.
