Title: Effects of renin-angiotensin system inhibitor type and dosage on survival after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: The objective of the study was to determine the effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RASI) on the survival of subgroups of patients with aortic stenosis after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and to assess the impact of types and dosages of RASI on outcomes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This single-centre, retrospective analysis included 2862 patients (n = 2227 with RASI and n = 635 without RASI) after successful TAVI. Propensity score matching established comparable patient populations (n = 625 per group). Survival was analysed by Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression and was corrected for baseline, procedural, and medical parameters. Self-reported adherence to RASI therapy 3 months after hospital discharge was 94%. Three-year all-cause mortality rates were 12.3% and 20.2% for patients with or without RASI, respectively (log-rank <0.001). In the matched study populations, mortality rates were 14.2% vs. 20.0% (log-rank <0.03). RASI was particularly beneficial in patients with ejection fraction <40% [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval 0.50 (0.29-0.87)], EuroScore II ≥4% [HR 0.47 (0.35-0.65)], or low-flow, low-gradient aortic stenosis [HR 0.53 (0.31-0.93)] who were also on beta-blockers and statins. An association between discharge dosage and survival was observed, with HR 0.75 (0.58-0.96) and 0.57 (0.44-0.72) for patients on <50% and ≥50% target dose, respectively. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) reduced mortality rates similarly (13.9% vs. 9.8%, log-rank 0.103).
CONCLUSIONS: The beneficial association between RASI after TAVI and improved survival during follow-up is particularly evident in high-risk patients and may be dose dependent. No superiority was noted in the effectiveness of ACEI or ARB.
