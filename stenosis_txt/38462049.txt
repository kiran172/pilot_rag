Title: Hybrid Interventions in Congenital Heart Disease: A Review of Current Practice and Rationale for Use.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hybrid interventions have become a common option in the management for a variety of patients with congenital heart disease. In this review, we discuss the data that have driven decision making about hybrid interventions to date.
METHODS: The existing literature on various hybrid approaches was reviewed and summarized. In addition, the key tenants to creating a successful hybrid program within a congenital heart center are elucidated.
RESULTS: Hybrid strategies for single-ventricle patients, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and muscular ventricular septal defect closure have important benefits and limitations compared with traditional approaches.
CONCLUSION: A growing body of evidence supports the use of hybrid interventions in congenital heart disease. But important questions remain regarding improved survival and other long-term outcomes, such as neurocognition, that might impact widespread adoption as a primary treatment strategy.
