Title: Assessment of Neutrophil Extracellular Traps (NETs) and Macrophage Ratio in the Inner and Outer Area of Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: It is noteworthy that majority of the data links neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to human arterial thrombosis. In the current study, extracellular neutrophil networks and macrophage polarization were assessed in the area outside and inside the Carotid artery stenosis.
METHODS: The sample of Carotid plaque of the patient was divided into two halves with a transverse incision; the terms inner part and outer part were used for the plaque's inner part and the adjacent area. Samples were sorted in 10% formalin for CD163, CD11c, MPO, and histone H3 immunohistochemical assessment, while part of the sample was stored at -80Â°C for western blotting assay for PDA4 marker.
RESULTS: Results of this study showed that the extracellular neutrophil in the inner part of the Carotid plaque was significantly increased (P&lt;0.0001), while the number of M1 and M2 macrophages was higher in the inner part compared with the outer part of the Carotid plaque (P&lt;0.0001).
CONCLUSION: The distribution of NETs and the ratio of macrophages may be different in the inner and outer aspects of arterial plaque.
