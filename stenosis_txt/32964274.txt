Title: A novel identification system combining diffusion kurtosis imaging with conventional magnetic resonance imaging to assess intestinal strictures in patients with Crohn's disease.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the utility of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) for assessing bowel fibrosis and to establish a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based classification based on DKI and conventional MRI parameters for characterizing intestinal strictures in Crohn's disease (CD) using the histological evaluation of resected intestine samples as the reference standard.
METHODS: Thirty-one patients with CD undergoing preoperative conventional MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (b values = 0-2000 s/mm2) were consecutively enrolled. We classified the mural T2-weighted signal intensity and arterial-phase enhancement patterns on conventional MRI. We also measured DWI-derived apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) and DKI-derived apparent diffusion for non-Gaussian distribution (D<sub>app</sub>) and apparent diffusional kurtosis (K<sub>app</sub>). A new MRI-based classification was established to characterize intestinal strictures in CD. Its performance was validated in nine additional patients with CD.
RESULTS: Histological inflammation grades were significantly correlated to T2-weighted signal intensity (r = 0.477; P &lt; 0.001) and ADC (r = - 0.226; P = 0.044). Histological fibrosis grades were moderately correlated to K<sub>app</sub> (r = 0.604, P &lt; 0.001); they were also correlated to D<sub>app</sub> (r = - 0.491; P &lt; 0.001) and ADC (r = - 0.270; P = 0.015). T2-weighted signal intensity could differentiate between no-to-mild and moderate-to-severe bowel inflammation (sensitivity, 0.970; specificity, 0.479). K<sub>app</sub> could differentiate between no-to-mild and moderate-to-severe bowel fibrosis (sensitivity, 0.959; specificity, 0.781). The agreement between the new MRI-based classification and the histological classification was moderate in the test (κ = 0.507; P &lt; 0.001) and validation (κ = 0.530; P &lt; 0.001) sets.
CONCLUSIONS: DKI can be used to assess bowel fibrosis. The new MRI-based classification can help to distinguish between fibrotic and inflammatory intestinal strictures in patients with CD.
