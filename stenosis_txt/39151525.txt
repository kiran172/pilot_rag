Title: Long-term clinical efficacy of drug-coated balloon angioplasty for TASCII C/D femoropopliteal lesions in older patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia: A retrospective study.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of drug-coated drug (DCB) angioplasty for long femoropopliteal lesions in older patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). In this multi-center retrospective study, we enrolled 119 patients with CLTI due to Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus (TASCII) C/D femoropopliteal lesions who underwent DCB angioplasty. A total of 119 patients with 122 limbs (TASCII C = 67, 54.9%; TASCII D = 55, 45.1%) were enrolled. At 36-month follow-up, primary patency, assisted primary patency, secondary patency, and freedom from target lesion revascularization were 47.3%, 49.8%, 59.5%, and 62.7%, respectively, and there was a significant improvement over baseline in Rutherford class (P < .001) and ankle-brachial index measurements (P < .001). Complex target lesions (P = .017) and 1 stenosis-free outflow vessel (P = .001) were risk predictors of freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization. Complex target lesions (P = .044), diabetes (P = .007), and 1 stenosis-free outflow vessel (P = .003) were risk predictors of restenosis. At 2 months, the ulcer healing rate was 96.3% (26/27). At 36 months, the limb salvage and survival rates were 85.8% and 83.3%, respectively. DCB angioplasty were safe and effective for older patients with CLTI attributable to femoropopliteal TASCII C/D lesions.
