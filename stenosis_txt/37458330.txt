Title: Surgical Outcomes by Early Airway Endoscopy Findings after Pediatric Staged Laryngotracheoplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine how initial postoperative airway endoscopy findings after stent removal predict successful decannulation in children undergoing double-staged laryngotracheoplasty (dsLTP). Secondary objectives assessed timing of decannulation and number of endoscopic interventions needed after dsLTP.
METHODS: A case series with chart review included children who underwent dsLTP at a tertiary children's hospital between 2008 and 2021. Rates of decannulation, time to decannulation, and number of interventions after dsLTP were recorded for children with high- or low-grade stenosis at the first bronchoscopy after stent removal.
RESULTS: Of the 65 children who were included, 88% had high-grade stenosis and 98% had a preoperative tracheostomy. Successful decannulation happened in 74% of the children, and 44% of the children were decannulated within 12 months of surgery. For children with low-grade stenosis at the first endoscopy after stent removal, 84% were successfully decannulated compared with 36% of the children with high-grade stenosis (p = 0.001). After dsLTP, children with high-grade stenosis required 7.5 interventions (SD: 3.3) compared with 4.0 interventions (SD: 3.0) for children with low-grade stenosis (p < 0.001). Decannulated children with high-grade stenosis necessitated more endoscopic procedures (7.0 vs. 3.7, p = 0.02). Time to decannulation was similar between children with high- and low-grade early postoperative stenosis (21.9 vs. 17.8 months, p = 0.63).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher grade stenosis identified on the first airway endoscopy after suprastomal stent removal is correlated with lower decannulation rates and more postoperative endoscopic interventions. Although time to decannulation was not impacted by early stenosis grade, surgeons might utilize these early airway findings to counsel families and prognosticate possible surgical success.
