Title: The interplay of long noncoding RNA HULC with microRNA-128-3p and their correlations with lipid level, stenosis degree, inflammatory cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules in coronary heart disease patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long noncoding RNA HULC (lnc-HULC) and its target microRNA-128-3p (miR-128-3p) regulate endothelial cell function, blood lipid level, and inflammatory cytokine production, which are involved in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Based on the above information, this study intended to further investigate the correlation between lnc-HULC and miR-128-3p, as well as their clinical values for CHD management.
METHODS: Totally, 141 CHD patients and 70 controls were enrolled. Lnc-HULC and miR-128-3p in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Serum inflammatory cytokines and cell adhesion molecules were further determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in CHD patients.
RESULTS: Lnc-HULC was upregulated, while miR-128-3p was downregulated in CHD patients than in controls (both P &lt; 0.001). The ROC curve further displayed that lnc-HULC (AUC: 0.906, 95% CI: 0.867-0.945) and miR-128-3p (AUC: 0.814, 95% CI: 0.756-0.873) had the potential of discriminating CHD patients from controls. Regarding the correlation between lnc-HULC and miR-128-3p, lnc-HULC was negatively associated with miR-128-3p in CHD patients (r<sub>s</sub> =  - 0.307, P &lt; 0.001), but this association was not observed in controls (r<sub>s</sub> =  - 0.155, P = 0.199). Furthermore, it was discovered that upregulated lnc-HULC was associated with elevated blood lipid levels (TG, LDL-C), inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-17A), cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1), and Gensini score (all P &lt; 0.05) in CHD patients. Meanwhile, miR-128-3p was negatively associated with blood lipid level (LDL-C), inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6), cell adhesion molecules (VCAM-1, ICAM-1), and Gensini score (all P &lt; 0.05) in CHD patients.
CONCLUSION: Lnc-HULC and its target miR-128-3p relate to lipid level, stenosis degree, inflammatory cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules in CHD patients.
