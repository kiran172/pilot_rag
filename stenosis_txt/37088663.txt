Title: Atteintes coronariennes et artérite a cellules géantes : à propos de 2 cas et revue de la littérature.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Coronaritis is a rare but serious complication of giant-cell arteritis (GCA), with an estimated prevalence of less than 1%, however difficult to establish, and of early onset.
METHODS: We describe 2 cases of GCA presenting with coronaritis and present a review of the literature on this complication.
RESULTS: The first patient presented with stable angina on common trunk coronaritis with ostial stenosis. Corticosteroid combined with tocilizumab from the outset resulted in improvement. Angioplasty was performed at 6months with good outcome. The second patient presented with asymptomatic tritruncular ostial coronaritis. Corticosteroid allowed clinic-biological improvement of GCA. Two years later, he presented relapse with an acute coronary syndrome, with favorable evolution after angioplasty, increase of corticosteroids and addition of tocilizumab.
CONCLUSION: Patients presented were successfully treated with corticosteroids combined with tocilizumab and angioplasty of their coronary stenoses. Efficacy of tocilizumab in GCA has not been evaluated especially on coronaritis due to the rarity of this complication. Our experience and the cases reported in the literature suggest good results of angioplasty in this indication. Studies with long-term follow-up will be necessary to evaluate the risk of restenosis.
