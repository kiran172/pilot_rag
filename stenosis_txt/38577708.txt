Title: Prognostic value of serum albumin to creatinine ratio in patients undergoing carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of serum albumin-to-creatinine ratio (sACR) in carotid artery stenting (CAS) patients regarding in-hospital and 5-year outcomes.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study. Baseline characteristics were compared between patients by admission albumin to creatinine ratio and categorized accordingly: T1, T2 and T3. 609 patients were included in the study. Serum albumin and creatinine levels at hospital admission were used to calculate the sACR. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. MACE consisted of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), myocardial infarction (MI) and death. All follow-up data were obtained from electronic medical records or by interview. The study was terminated after 60 months of follow-up.
RESULTS: Serum albumin levels were found to be significantly lower in T1, while creatinine was found to be significantly higher in T1. T1 has the lowest sACR while T3 has the highest. In hospital, ipsilateral stroke, major stroke, MI and death were significantly higher in T1. In long-term outcomes, ipsilateral stroke, major stroke, and death were significantly higher in T1.
CONCLUSIONS: Low sACR values at hospital admission was independently associated with in-hospital and long-term mortality and major stroke in patients underwent CAS.
