Title: Role of ERCP in Benign Biliary Strictures.

Abstract: Benign biliary strictures (BBS) can be associated with several causes, with postoperative and inflammatory strictures representing the most common ones. Endoscopy represents nowadays the first-line treatment in the management of BBS. Endoscopic balloon dilatation, plastic stents placement, fully covered metal stent placement, and magnetic compression anastomosis are the endoscopic techniques available for the treatment of BBS. The aim of this study is to perform a review of the literature to assess the role of endoscopy in the management of BBS and to evaluate the application of the different procedures in the different clinical settings.
