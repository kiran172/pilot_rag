Title: [Left Ventricular Plasty for Left Ventricular Aneurysm Following Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy].

Abstract: An 82-years-old woman was admitted with sudden chest pain. Coronary angiography did not reveal any significant stenosis, but left ventriculography showed akinesis and ballooning of the apex with a hyperkinetic basal segment, suggestive of takotsubo cardiomyopathy. She suffered intractable heart failure, and laboratory data, electrocardiogram signs of ST-segment elevation and left ventricular( LV) apical dysfunction failed to show improvement. LV plasty was performed on 106th day after the onset because of aneurysmal change of the left ventricular apex myocardium, unremitting sanguineous pericardial effusion, and anemia. She had a good postoperative course and end-diastolic ventricular volume index was remarkably reduced from 144 to 55 ml/m2. She discharged home on the 38th postoperative day.
