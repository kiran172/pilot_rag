Title: Predictors of In-Hospital Mortality after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: The development of aortic valve stenosis is strongly associated with older adults. Patients who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis frequently have heart failure (HF). We investigated the predictors of mortality after TAVI according to the presence of HF, and specifically HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) versus HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Patients were identified from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample registry from January 2011 to September 2015 using the ICD-9 codes. Patients with HF who underwent TAVI were classified according to whether they were diagnosed with HFrEF or HFpEF. The principal outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. Multivariable analysis was used to adjust for potential baseline confounders. Among 11,609 patients undergoing TAVI, 6,368 (54.9%) had baseline HF, including 4,290 (67.4%) with HFpEF and 2,078 (32.6%) with HFrEF. In TAVI patients with HF, in-hospital mortality was also not significantly different in those with HFrEF compared with HFpEF (3.66% vs 3.17%, respectively; adjusted odds ratio 1.14, 95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.53; p = 0.38). Polyvalvular heart disease was an additional independent predictor of in-hospital mortality in HFrEF, whereas age, liver disease, and the absence of depression and anemia were additional independent predictors of mortality in HFpEF. In conclusion, baseline HF in patients undergoing TAVI is prevalent and is more commonly due to HFpEF than HFrEF. Mortality is similar in those with HFrEF and HFpEF. Knowledge of the specific predictors of mortality after TAVI in HF patients may be useful for patient selection and prognostic guidance.
