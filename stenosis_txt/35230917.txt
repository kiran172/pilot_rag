Title: Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysm associated with coeliac trunk occlusion treated with aorto-hepatic bypass and aneurysm resection.

Abstract: Pancreaticoduodenal artery aneurysms are rare visceral artery aneurysms that may be associated with stenosis of the coeliac trunk. We present a case of a 48-year-old woman with a symptomatic aneurysm of the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery caused by occlusion of the coeliac trunk due to median arcuate ligament syndrome. The patient was treated with an aorto-hepatic bypass and excision of the aneurysm. We discuss the case and the complexities and controversies in the treatment of this disease.
