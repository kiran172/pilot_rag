Title: A phase 3, open-label, single-arm study of vadadustat for anemia in chronic kidney disease for Japanese patients on hemodialysis not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents.

Abstract: Vadadustat is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor approved in Japan for the treatment of anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This phase 3, open-label, single-arm study evaluated the efficacy and safety of vadadustat in 24 Japanese patients with CKD-associated anemia on hemodialysis who were not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs). Patients received vadadustat for 24 weeks; the starting dose was 300 mg/day and doses were adjusted to achieve the target hemoglobin (Hb) range of 10.0-12.0 g/dL. The least squares mean of average Hb at Weeks 20 and 24 (95% confidence interval) was 10.75 g/dL (10.35, 11.14). The most common adverse event was shunt stenosis (25.0%). Adverse drug reactions (diarrhea and vomiting) occurred in two patients (8.3%) and the severity was mild. Vadadustat increased and maintained Hb levels within the target range and was generally well-tolerated in Japanese patients with anemia on hemodialysis not receiving ESAs.
