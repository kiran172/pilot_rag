Title: Endoscopic management of benign and malignant hilar stricture.

Abstract: Management of hilar strictures pose a significant challenge for endoscopists. Several strategies have been demonstrated in the last decade beyond decompression, however, there remains controversy and minimal consensus in the literature. This review seeks to summarize the current literature and discuss emerging therapies, such as photodynamic therapy and radiofrequency ablation.
