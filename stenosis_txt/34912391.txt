Title: Prevalence of Comorbidities among Patients with Acromegaly.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Acromegaly is a chronic disorder resulting from excessive secretion of growth hormone and (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and is associated with several comorbidities. These complications contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality associated with this condition thus early diagnosis leads to better outcomes. There have been studies in other countries to assess the comorbidities associated with acromegaly. However, we do not have any recent data with regards to Pakistan. So, in order to demonstrate the prevalence of demographics, hormonal disorders, and other complications associated with acromegaly we conducted this study.
METHODS: It is a retrospective review of patients' records presented to the tertiary care Hospital, Karachi, Pakistan for the diagnosis and management of acromegaly and the complications associated with this condition between the time periods 2000 till 2020. A total of 89 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria of acromegaly and were included in the study. Comorbid conditions were described based on current guidelines. Patient baseline characteristics were recorded along with other complications arising during treatment.
RESULTS: Eighty-nine patients were included. 64% were male, over 70% were older than 30 years old and more than 40% of patients had BMI greater than 30. HTN, pre-hypertension, and CCF were reported in 35.95%, 3.37%, and 6.74%. Diabetes mellitus, hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and hyperprolactinemia were reported in 39.32%, 38.20%, 37.07%, 34.46%, and 16.85% of cases. The prevalence of osteoarthritis, blood disorder, skin changes, thyroid cancer, and spinal stenosis was found out to be around 1.12% each.
CONCLUSIONS: Acromegaly is associated with cardiovascular and endocrinal disorders. Screening for these disorders at the time of diagnosis can lead to early management and better outcomes translating into decreased mortality.
