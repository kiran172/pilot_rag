Title: The p48 MW flow modulation device for treatment of unruptured, saccular intracranial aneurysms: a single center experience from 77 consecutive aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The p48 MW Flow Modulation Device (phenox, Bochum Germany) is a low profile flow diverter stent (FDS), designed for implantation into intracranial arteries with a diameter of less than 3.5 mm.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the p48 MW FDS in the treatment of unruptured aneurysms located at intracranial arteries with less than 3.5 mm diameter based on a retrospective analysis from a single tertiary neurovascular center.
METHODS: A prospectively maintained database was retrospectively reviewed to identify all cases of intracranial saccular aneurysms treated electively with the p48 MW device. Records were made of basic demographics, aneurysmal characteristics, interventional procedures, adverse events, clinical outcomes and occlusion rates on angiographic follow-ups.
RESULTS: A total of 77 aneurysms and 74 patients were included. The mean size of the treated aneurysms was 3.5 ± 2.4 mm and the mean aspect ratio was 1.3 ± 0.4. A total of 80 endovascular procedures were performed with a total of 12 (15%) adverse events leading to two (2.5%) permanent morbidities/mortalities. Technical issues were encountered in 3 (3.9%) cases. Adequate occlusion of the treated aneurysm was recorded in 55.6% and 63.9% on the first and latest available DSA follow-ups, respectively. There were no cases of side-branch occlusion.
CONCLUSIONS: The p48 MW is an easy-to-use implant with very good safety margins. Side branch occlusion and significant in-stent stenosis are infrequently encountered. The time from implantation to sufficient aneurysm occlusion takes longer than with FDS with lower porosity.
