Title: Abdominal Vascular Evaluation.

Abstract: The vascular lab (VL) is instrumental in diagnosing vascular diseases such as renal artery stenosis and mesenteric ischemia or following a patient after transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt (TIPS) creation. This article discusses indications, protocol, and diagnostic criteria for abdominal vascular ultrasound. The vascular lab can be used to investigate pathology in the abdomen either as a preliminary screening tool to evaluate for a pathology such as mesenteric artery stenosis in a patient with food fear and weight loss, renal artery stenosis in a patient with refractory hypertension or renal failure, or as a diagnostic tool in follow up after a patient has undergone a transjugular intrahepatic portal systemic shunt (TIPS) for portal hypertension. The technical success of duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen can be compromised by respiratory motion, obesity, and intestinal gas. Therefore, duplex scanning is performed in the fasting state particularly in elective outpatient cases. In emergent cases when pathology such as acute mesenteric ischemia is suspected evaluation with CT angiography may be best.
