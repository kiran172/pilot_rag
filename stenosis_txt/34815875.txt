Title: Delayed presentation of congenital rectal stenosis associated with Down's syndrome and hypothyroidism: Case report.

Abstract: Rectal stenosis is a rare variety of rectal atresia. A membrane separates the rectum from the anal canal in the presence of a normal anus. We report a case of rectal stenosis associated with Down's syndrome and hypothyroidism in whom rectal stenosis was diagnosed at the age of 17 years.
