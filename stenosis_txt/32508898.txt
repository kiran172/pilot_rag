Title: Neuroendovascular Cerebral Sinus Stenting in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare, ill-understood disease of significant morbidity. Because the pathophysiology is poorly understood, treatment protocols are not uniform and are directed towards alleviating the most common symptoms: headache and visual loss. In this review, we analyze 25 case series, all of which included IIH patients (n = 408) who were treated with placement of a venous sinus stent. Among 342 patients who had headache, 240 patients (70.2%) had improvement or resolution of headache after the stent insertion. Of the 217 patients documented to have visual problems, visual acuity was improved or stabilized in 161 patients (74.2%). Of the 304 patients with papilledema, 257 showed resolution or improved (84.5%). Of the 124 patients who presented with pulsatile tinnitus, it was resolved in 110 patients (88.7%) after stent placement. Endovascular management of dural sinus stenosis is therefore clinically efficacious in patients with IIH who have failed medical and surgical therapy.
