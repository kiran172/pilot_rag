Title: Large Vessel Occlusion in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients: A Dual-Center Estimate Based on a Broad Definition of Occlusion Site.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of the frequency of large vessel occlusion (LVO) is important to determine needs for neurointerventionists and thrombectomy-capable stroke facilities. Current estimates vary from 13% to 52%, depending on acute ischemic stroke (AIS) definition and methods for AIS and LVO determination. We sought to estimate LVO prevalence among confirmed and suspected AIS patients at 2 comprehensive US stroke centers using a broad occlusion site definition: internal carotid artery (ICA), first and second segments of the middle cerebral artery (MCA M1,M2), the anterior cerebral artery, vertebral artery, basilar artery, or the proximal posterior cerebral artery.
METHODS: We analyzed prospectively maintained stroke databases of patients presenting to the centers between January and December 2017. ICD-10 coding was used to determine the number of patients discharged with an AIS diagnosis. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) was reviewed to determine LVO presence and site. Percentages of patients with LVO among the confirmed AIS population were reported.
RESULTS: Among 2245 patients with an AIS discharge diagnosis, 418 (18.6%:95% confidence interval [CI] 17.3%-20.0%) had LVO documented on CTA or MRA. Most common occlusion site was M1 (n=139 [33.3%]), followed by M2 (n=114 [27.3%]), ICA (n=69[16.5%]), and tandem ICA-MCA lesions (n=44 [10.5%]). Presentation National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores were significantly different for different occlusion sites (P=.02).
CONCLUSIONS: The LVO prevalence in our large series of consecutive AIS patients was 18.6% (95% CI 17.3%-20.0%). Despite the use of a broad definition, this estimate is less than that reported in most previous studies.
