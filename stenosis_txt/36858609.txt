Title: Severity of Mitral Valve Stenosis　- Possible Relationships With Blood Oxidant Markers and Antioxidants.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study examined whether the severity of mitral valve stenosis (MVS) is associated with oxidative stress (OS) markers in the blood, and other hematological and clinicodemographic parameters.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This prospective study was conducted between March and May 2022. Seventy-five patients with newly diagnosed MVS (25 mild, 25 moderate, 25 severe) were included. Mild, moderate, and severe MVS was defined as MV area &gt;2, 1.5-2, and &lt;1.5 cm2, respectively. Various OS markers and laboratory parameters were determined in venous blood samples. For predictive analyses, 2 different analyses were performed to detect patients with severe MVS and those with moderate or severe (moderate/severe) MVS. Age (P=0.388) and sex (P=0.372) distribution were similar in the 3 groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that a high white blood cell (WBC) count (P=0.023) and high malondialdehyde (P=0.010), superoxide dismutase (SOD; P=0.008), and advanced oxidation protein products (AOPP; P=0.007) levels were independently associated with severe MVS. A low platelet count (P=0.030) and high malondialdehyde (P=0.018), SOD (P=0.008), and AOPP (P=0.001) levels were independently associated with having moderate/severe MVS. The best discriminatory factors for severe MVS were SOD (cut-off &gt;315.5 ng/mL) and glutathione (cut-off &gt;4.7 μmol/L).
CONCLUSIONS: MVS severity seems to be affected by oxidant markers (malondialdehyde and AOPP), antioxidant enzymes (SOD), and inflammation-related cells (WBC and platelets). Future studies are needed to examine these relationships in larger populations.
