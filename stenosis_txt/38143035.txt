Title: Cinnamaldehyde has Antifibrotic Effects on Rats with Epidural Fibrosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Laminectomy is a widely employed surgical procedure for the treatment of spinal stenosis, but it may lead to epidural fibrosis (EF) and failed back surgery syndrome. Cinnamaldehyde, a phenylpropanoid found in cinnamon, has demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In the present study, we hypothesized that topical application and systemic administration of cinnamaldehyde could be helpful in the prevention of EF in a rat laminectomy model.
METHODS: The rats were randomly assigned to control, local, and systemic Tween-80 and local and systemic cinnamaldehyde experimental groups (n = 6, per group). In the control group, just laminectomy was performed. In local treatment groups, applications were done just after the laminectomy onto dura. In systemic treatment groups, intraperitoneal administrations were performed following skin suturing. The degree of epidural fibrosis was evaluated macroscopically and histopathologically 4 weeks later.
RESULTS: Macroscopic assessment revealed decreased EF with both topical and systemic cinnamaldehyde application, whereas microscopic examination results were not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide the first experimental evidence of cinnamaldehyde's potential protective effects against EF.
