Title: [A Case of Superior Mesenteric Artery Syndrome Following Transverse Colon Cancer Surgery].

Abstract: We reported a case of superior mesenteric artery(SMA)syndrome after decreased body weight and unstable oral intakes due to anastomotic leakage of postoperative transverse colon cancer. A 63-year-old man underwent laparoscopic left hemicolectomy and D3 lymph node dissection with a diagnosis of transverse colon cancer. He had postoperative anastomotic leakage and was discharged after conservative treatment on postoperative day 35. However, he had visited our hospital by the symptom of bowel obstruction caused by anastomotic stenosis and had been admitted twice. After second colonoscopic balloon dilation on postoperative day 129, he was diagnosed as anastomotic perforation and emergency reoperation was performed. In the postoperative course, he repeated vomiting and his body weight decreased and superior mesenteric artery syndrome was diagnosed. He improved after conservative treatment by fasting, a nasogastric intubation and total parenteral nutrition and was discharged 22 days after the diagnosis.
