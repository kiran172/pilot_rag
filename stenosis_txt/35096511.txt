Title: An atypical case of hemodialysis access stent migration.

Abstract: Endovascular stent fractures are commonly seen in arteries but are rare events in the venous system. Stents deployed in hemodialysis vascular accesses can fracture and migrate to proximal locations. Complications associated with stent fracture include in-stent stenosis and central vein stenosis. In this report, we present a unique case of a hemodialysis access stent fracture that migrated to the left ventricle and manifested with chest pain.
