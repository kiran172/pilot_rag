Title: Analysis of Surgeon and Center Case Volume and Stroke or Death after Transcarotid Artery Revascularization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that the annual hospital volume of cases may affect the number of adverse events after carotid endarterectomy (CEA). We aim to study the associations between hospital as well as surgeon volume and the risk of stroke or death after transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR).
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of the Vascular Quality Initiative data of patients undergoing TCAR from 2016 to 2021. Surgeon and center volume were calculated based on the mean number of cases (MNC) performed yearly by each surgeon and center. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of in-hospital stroke or death.
RESULTS: A total of 22,624 cases were included. Surgeon volume was divided into 3 quantiles: low (MNC = 4), medium (MNC = 10), and high (MNC = 26). Center volume was also divided into low (MNC = 14), medium (MNC = 32), and high (MNC = 64). After adjusting for potential confounders, and when compared with high-volume centers, low and medium center volumes were not associated with any increased odds of in-hospital stroke and death, stroke, death, or stroke with transient ischemic attack (TIA). Compared with high-volume surgeons, low surgeons' volume was associated with a higher odd of stroke (odds ratio 1.5, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.04, p = 0.008), and stroke and TIA (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.9, p = 0.002). However, medium surgeon volume was not associated with higher odds of stroke and death, stroke, and stroke with TIA. Neither low nor medium surgeon volume was associated with a difference in mortality compared with high surgeon volume.
CONCLUSIONS: In this retrospective study, center volume was not associated with any differences in outcomes among patients undergoing TCAR. On the other hand, surgeons with low volume were associated with a higher risk of stroke, death, or MI and stroke or TIA when compared with high surgeon volume. There was no difference in outcomes between medium and high surgeon volume.
