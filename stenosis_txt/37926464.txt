Title: Gastric ectopic pancreas adenocarcinoma: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: The incidence of malignant transformation in ectopic pancreas (EP), including adenocarcinoma, is extremely rare. Herein, we presented a single case with invasive adenocarcinoma caused by the EP in the stomach. The patient consulted our hospital due to abdominal discomfort with acid regurgitation. Computed tomography scan showed a pyloric obstruction and thickening of the gastric wall in the gastric antrum; a digestive endoscopic examination showed mucosal congestion, swelling in the anterior pyloric area, and pyloric canal stenosis. Next, the patient underwent gastrointestinal surgery, and the distal gastrectomy specimens revealed a deviation of 10 cm towards the lesser curvature and an extension of 22 cm towards the greater curvature. A 5.5 x 5.4 cm round-like mass was found during surgery. Pathological examination suggested invasive submucosal adenocarcinoma located under the gastric antrum mucosa. Our report provides additional clinical experience for diagnosing EP with canceration in the stomach.
