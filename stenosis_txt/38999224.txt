Title: Cardiovascular Imaging for Coronary Artery Disease in Patients with Diabetes Mellitus.

Abstract: In patients with diabetes mellitus, accelerated progression of atherosclerosis can lead to worse clinical outcomes. Determining the best diagnostic strategy to identify patients with increased cardiovascular risk is challenging. Current guidelines recommend using both functional imaging and CT angiography to detect myocardial ischemia and coronary artery disease based on pre-test probability. Functional imaging is suggested for patients with a higher clinical likelihood due to its higher rule-in diagnostic capacity. On the other hand, CT angiography is preferred for patients with lower pre-test probability because of its excellent negative predictive value. The optimal management strategy for asymptomatic diabetic patients remains unclear. In asymptomatic diabetic patients, previous randomized trials have not shown benefits from diagnostic testing over standard care. However, these trials were methodologically inconsistent and lacked clear stratification of cardiovascular risk. In terms of invasive evaluation, a combined invasive functional and anatomic imaging approach for angiographically intermediate coronary stenosis appears to be the best, most effective decision pathway for managing diabetic patients.
