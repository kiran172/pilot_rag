Title: Mid-term Outcomes of the Supported Ross Procedure in Children, Teenagers, and Young Adults.

Abstract: The Ross procedure in children, teenagers, and young adults, especially among those with a bicuspid aortic valve with aortic regurgitation, has been associated with neoaortic root dilatation and recurrence of aortic regurgitation. We have shown that at intermediate follow-up, patients who underwent a supported Ross technique were less likely to have neoaortic root dilatation. This study summarizes our most recent outcomes. This was a retrospective review of 40 consecutive pediatric and young adult patients undergoing a supported Ross procedure from 2005 to 2018. Clinical outcomes were reviewed in addition to echocardiographic measures of neoaortic dimension and neoaortic valve function. The median age at surgery was 16.0 years (range 10 - 35 years). Preoperative diagnosis was aortic regurgitation in 15 (37.5%) and mixed regurgitation/stenosis in 20 (50%). Median follow-up was 3.5 years (1.4-5.6) with 3 patients followed for more than 10 years. There were no deaths. Five patients had a reintervention, but only 1 on the aortic valve. One patient returned to the operating room on postoperative day 1 for revision of the right coronary button. Two patients required biventricular pacemakers for reduced ejection fraction. One patient developed aortic regurgitation and underwent mechanical valve replacement and another required a reintervention on the homograft with a percutaneously placed pulmonary valve replacement. At last follow-up, 39 patients had mild or less aortic regurgitation with median sinus z-score of 1.40 (0.48-2.07). Mid-term follow-up of pediatric and young adult patients undergoing a supported Ross operation for various aortic valve pathologies demonstrate excellent results with minimal neoaortic root dilation and reintervention.
