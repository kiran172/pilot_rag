Title: [Endovascular treatment of intracranial venous sinus stenosis in intracranial hypertension: three case reports and a discussion of the literature].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is an entity with an incidence of approximately 1.2: 100,000 inhabitants/year. It affects in a greater proportion obese women and women of childbearing age. Headache is the most characteristic symptom, followed by visual disturbances. In recent years, the diagnosis of dural sinus stenosis has increased in cases of intracranial hypertension resistant to conventional treatment. For this reason, the development of endovascular therapy as a therapeutic option in selected patients is booming.
CASE REPORTS: We present three cases of intracranial hypertension secondary to dural sinus stenosis, diagnosed and treated in our hospital. Despite the establishment of adequate diuretic treatment and the performance of invasive procedures to bypass the cerebrospinal fluid, they persisted with neurological symptoms and visual deficits. After verifying that they fulfilled the requirements described in the literature, they underwent intracranial stenting, with satisfactory results in all of them, achieving the disappearance of the headache and recovery of visual acuity.
CONCLUSION: Stenting of dural sinus stenosis as a cause of intracranial hypertension is an increasingly used technique, which has presented favorable results. Studies are necessary to know its long-term impact.
