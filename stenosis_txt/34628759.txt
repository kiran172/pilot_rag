Title: [Removal of Shield Needles from Graphene Oxide Thrombus and Preparation].

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease commonly seen in clinical practice. It can lead to thickening of vascular intima, occlusion of lumen stenosis and thrombosis, leading to angina pectoris, hypertension, myocardial infarction and other diseases, posing a serious threat to human life and health. This study provides a method for removing shield needles from graphene oxide thrombus and its preparation. The graphene oxide shield needle mainly includes flexible rotating shaft, radial flexible rod, rotating needle, adsorption main pipe and dosing main pipe, laser measuring device, high definition camera and other structures, which has the following advantages:firstly, it achieves multi-angle rotation grinding thrombosis, precise rotation grinding, avoids vascular damage and infection; secondly, thrombolytic drugs can be applied in the process of rotary grinding and small thrombus can be adsorbed to effectively avoid secondary embolization of blood vessels; thirdly, it a coating of graphene oxide on a rotating needle, which protects against bacteria and infection. This study has practical reference value for the development of thrombotherapy and the application of graphene in the medical field.
