Title: Successful Management of Recurrent Tunneled Dialysis Catheter Infections with the Hemodialysis Reliable Outflow Graft Device.

Abstract: The hemodialysis reliable outflow (HeRO) graft was designed for patients with failed arteriovenous accesses caused by an obstructed central venous outflow or patients who have exhausted all upper arm options. We describe a patient with severe stenosis of the superior vena cava (SVC) who experienced recurrent episodes of infection of permanent tunneled catheters, resulting in repeated hospitalizations. We successfully used the HeRO graft after angioplasty of the SVC. This indication for placing the HeRO graft has not been emphasized and mentioned previously in the literature. We also reviewed the literature regarding comparisons of this technique with other options.
