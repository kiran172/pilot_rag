Title: Percutaneous Full-Endoscopic Lumbar Foraminoplasty and Decompression by Using a Visualization Reamer for Lumbar Lateral Recess and Foraminal Stenosis in Elderly Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous endoscopic lumbar discectomy has been widely used to treat lumbar disc herniation; its advantages are less trauma, faster recovery, lower costs, and higher percentage of patient satisfaction compared with open surgery. Treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis with percutaneous full-endoscopic surgery is still challenging, especially for elderly patients with multiple comorbidities and complex pathologic factors. The aim of this study was to introduce percutaneous full-endoscopic lumbar foraminoplasty and decompression using a visualization reamer in elderly patients with lateral recess and foraminal stenosis and evaluate efficacy and safety.
METHODS: This retrospective review comprised 65 consecutive elderly patients (30 men and 35 women) with lateral recess and foraminal stenosis who underwent percutaneous full-endoscopic lumbar foraminoplasty and discectomy from January 2017 to September 2017. Visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index were used to evaluate pain relief and neurologic improvement.
RESULTS: Mean patient age was 71.58 years (range, 65-89 years). Mean follow-up period was 16.12 months (range, 12-20 months). Mean operative time was 98.59 minutes per level (range, 55-120 minutes). Mean intraoperative perspective frequency was 3.21 times (range, 2-6 times). Mean hospital stay after the procedure was 2.18 days (range, 1-4 days). Back and leg visual analog scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores at all time points in the postoperative period were significantly lower than preoperatively (P < 0.01). At final follow-up, modified MacNab criteria were rated as follows: excellent, 47 patients (72.31%); good, 12 patients (16.92%); fair, 3 patients (4.62%); and poor, 4 patients (6.15%). Therefore, excellent or good results were obtained in 89.23% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous full-endoscopic lumbar foraminoplasty and discectomy using a visualization reamer is an effective and safe treatment for elderly patients with lumbar lateral recess and foraminal stenosis. It improves safety and efficiency of decompression and reduces intraoperative fluoroscopy.
