Title: The Use of Preputial Dartos Flap in the Primary Repair of Distal Hypospadias: A Single-centre Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: An additional flap during the tubularization of incised urethral plate urethroplasty (TIPU) is believed to minimize the postoperative complications. It is still debatable whether using an additional flap is worth the risk given the hazards associated with doing so. This study aims to re-evaluate the benefits and drawbacks of TIPU with or without a preputial dartos (PD) flap.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed the results of patients with distal hypospadias who underwent surgery in our institute over the past 2 years. The urethral plate's width, thickness, and depth, the periurethral tissue's quality, and the width of the glans at the mid-glans level determined whether the neourethra was covered with a PD flap or left uncovered. Data on intra-operative blood loss, operating time, length of hospital stay, postoperative complications, and outcome were analysed.
RESULTS: There were 96 patients: 58 received an extra PD flap, whereas the other 38 did not. In the flap group, ventral skin necrosis was a prevalent problem, whereas meatal stenosis predominated in the no-flap group. Both the flap group (25.66%) and the no-flap group (23.86%) experienced comparable postoperative complications (P = 0.503). In comparison to the no-flap group, the flap group showed statistically significant differences (P&lt;0.001) in intra-operative blood loss (22.10 ± 6.96 vs. 10.34 ± 3.02 mL), operating time (96.34 ± 6.661 vs. 71.39 ± 9.76 min), and hospital stay (10.04 ± 0.87 vs. 8.47 ± 1.64 days).
CONCLUSION: The additional PD flap does not always affect the result of TIPU in terms of complications.
