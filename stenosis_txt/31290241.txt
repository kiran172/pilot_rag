Title: Does valve in valve TAVR carry a higher risk for thromboembolic events compared to native valve TAVR?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk for brain lesions in valve in valve (VIV)-transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) compared to native valve procedures (NV-TAVR).
BACKGROUND: TAVR is associated with the risk of stroke and a high incidence of brain lesions in diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI). The risk in VIV procedures is unknown.
METHODS: Patients were included, if they received a Sapien-3 or an Evolut-R valve for an NV-TAVR or VIV-TAVR and a DW-MRI within 3-5 days after the procedure.
RESULTS: Two hundred nine patients had NV-TAVR and 41 patients had VIV-TAVR. The VIV group was significantly younger (mean 82.3 vs. 74.7 years old, p < .001) but had higher mean EuroSCORE II (4.8 vs. 7.8, p < .001). Predilatation was significantly more common with native valve (39% vs. 2%, p < .01), postdilatation rate was lower in VIV but without statistical significance (17% vs. 7%, p = .110). Combined in-hospital safety outcome was comparable [13(6.6%) vs. 5(12.2%), p = .205]. Any stroke was documented in four (0.5%) patients after native valve and in one (2.4%) after VIV-TAVR. New DW-MRI brain lesions were significantly more often found in patients with native valves [153(73.2%) vs. 21(51.2%), p = .005], mean number of new lesions was also higher with native valve (2.8 ± 3.2 vs. 1.0 ± 1.4, p < .001). Forward stepwise of logistic regression found age and post dilatation significant predictors of new MRI lesions.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to native valves, VIV procedures were associated with lower incidence and number of brain lesions according to DW-MRI; these were explained by lower patients' age and lower rate of postdilatation.
