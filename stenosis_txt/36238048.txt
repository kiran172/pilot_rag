Title: Extent of Subprosthetic Pannus after Aortic Valve Replacement: Changes Over Time and Relationship with Echocardiographic Findings.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate changes of subprosthetic pannus on cardiac CT and determine its relationship to echocardiographic findings in patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement (AVR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2011 and November 2017, 17 AVR patients (56.8 ± 8.9 years, 12% male) who showed pannus formation on CT and had undergone both follow-up CT and echocardiography were included. The mean interval from AVR to the date of pannus detection was 10.5 ± 7.1 years. In the initial and follow-up CT and echocardiography, the pannus extent and echocardiographic parameters were compared using paired t-tests. The relationship between the opening angle of the prosthetic valve and the pannus extent was evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis.
RESULTS: The pannus extent was significantly increased on CT (p &lt; 0.05). The peak velocity (3.9 ± 0.8 m/s vs. 4.2 ± 0.8 m/s, p = 0.03) and mean pressure gradient (36.4 ± 15.5 mm Hg vs. 42.1 ± 15.8 mm Hg, p = 0.03) were significantly increased. The mean opening angles of the mechanical aortic leaflets were slightly decreased, but there was no statistical significance (73.1 ± 8.3° vs. 69.4 ± 12.1°, p = 0.12). The opening angle of the prosthetic leaflets was inversely correlated with the pannus extent (r = -0.57, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The pannus extent increases over time, increasing transvalvular peak velocity and the pressure gradient. CT can be used to evaluate the pannus extent associated with hemodynamic changes that need to be managed by surgical intervention.
