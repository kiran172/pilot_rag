Title: Use of pediatric donor en bloc kidneys along with bladder segment in pediatric liver-kidney and multivisceral-kidney transplantation.

Abstract: The combination of pediatric multivisceral and kidney transplantation leads to additional recipient risks due to the number of anastomoses and to the small sizes of donor structures. The inclusion of donor kidneys, ureters, and a bladder patch en bloc with multivisceral organs decreases the number and complexity of anastomoses and has not yet been reported. Four patients were transplanted in this fashion; three underwent multivisceral-kidney and one underwent liver-kidney transplantation. The first patient was a 3-year-old male with polycystic kidney disease and congenital hepatic fibrosis. The second was a 7-year-old female with complications from necrotizing enterocolitis. The third was a 12-month-old male with megacystis microcolon intestinal hypoperistalsis syndrome and secondary hydronephrosis, and the fourth was a 3-year-old male with multiple intestinal resections secondary to incarcerated hernia. The third patient developed a right ureteral stenosis with an intact bladder patch. The fourth child expired from maintained abdominal sepsis. The first 3 patients maintained normal graft function. There were no cases of thrombosis, arterial stenosis, or urinary leakages. These reported cases demonstrate that small pediatric en bloc transplantation of the multivisceral organs and dual kidneys with a bladder patch anastomosis is a feasible and less complex alternative to the standard procedure.
