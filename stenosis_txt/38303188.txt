Title: [Paclitaxel plus Bevacizumab Combination Therapy for Esophageal Metastasis of Breast Cancer-A Case Report].

Abstract: An 80-year-old woman with a history of left breast cancer complained of dysphagia. At the age of 67 years, she had undergone a left modified radical mastectomy, chemotherapy, and endocrine therapy for left breast cancer. Six years after adjuvant therapy completion, she developed dysphagia. Chest CT showed only midesophageal stenosis. Endoscopic examination revealed whole circumferential stenosis without mucosal abnormality located 25 cm from the incisors, and a biopsy showed histologically normal mucosa. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was performed 5 times in 1 year and 3 months. Subsequently, a biopsy specimen revealed adenocarcinoma, which suggested metastasis from the previous breast cancer. One month after the initiation of tamoxifen administration, dyspnea due to pleural effusion was encountered. We treated this via pleural adhesion therapy and changed the treatment to paclitaxel plus bevacizumab combination therapy. She continued paclitaxel plus bevacizumab therapy for 1 year and 4 months without any signs of recurrence.
