Title: Surgical treatment of symptomatic left anterior descending myocardial bridges: myotomy vs. bypass surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the effects of myotomy and bypass surgery for treating myocardial bridges (MBs) over the left anterior descending artery (LAD) in a single-center observation study.
METHODS: Fifty-four eligible patients (34 males, median age of 60 years old) with symptomatic LAD-MBs who underwent myotomy (31 patients) or bypass surgery (23 patients) were included in this study. The primary endpoints were the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and angiographic demonstration of adverse angiographic results.
RESULTS: No surgical death was observed. During a median follow-up of 26 months, 11 patients developed MACEs (7.4% for myotomy vs. 40.9% for bypass surgery, p = 0.007). Surgical strategy (bypass surgery vs. myotomy) was an independent risk factor for MACEs (odds ratio = 3.681, 95% confidence interval 1.814-8.685, p = 0.011). Myotomy compared with bypass surgery had a significantly lower incidence of adverse angiographic results (3.7% of residual compression vs. 40.9% of LIMA graft failure, p = 0.003). Among ten patients suffering from LAD-MBs with concomitant proximal coronary stenosis who underwent bypass surgery, only one reported transient recurrent exertional chest pain, and all LIMA grafts were patent.
CONCLUSIONS: Myotomy of symptomatic LAD-MBs may be associated with encouraging midterm results. Bypass surgery may be recommended for treating symptomatic LAD-MBs with concomitant proximal coronary stenosis.
