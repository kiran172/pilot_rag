Title: Pediatric airway compression in aortic arch malformations: a multidisciplinary approach.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic arch malformations (AAMs) should be suspected in the presence of persistent respiratory symptoms despite medical treatment or feeding problems at the pediatric age.
AIM: We report a descriptive cohort of patients with AAMs and the local management protocol applied.
METHODS: A total of 59 patients with AAM were retrospectively reviewed. Three groups were identified: double aortic arch (DAA), group 1; complete vascular ring (non-DAA), group 2; and anomalous origin of the innominate artery (IA), group 3.
RESULTS: Prenatal diagnosis was available for 62.7% of the patients. In all, 49.2% of children were symptomatic. There was a significantly different prevalence of respiratory symptoms within the three groups: 73.7% in group 1, 24.2% in group 2, and 100% in group 3 (p-value: &lt;0.001). Surgery was considered in the presence of symptoms in patients with DAA and in those with reduction of the tracheal section area greater than 50%. A total of 52.5% of the patients underwent surgical repair (median age 6 months). The median follow-up interval was 21.9 months. Respiratory symptoms improved in most symptomatic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: No specific protocols are available for the management of patients with AAMs. Conservative treatment seems to be reasonable for asymptomatic patients or those with airway stenosis less than 50%. A close follow-up is necessary to identify early patients who become symptomatic.
