Title: Transcatheter-based aortic valve replacement vs. isolated surgical aortic valve replacement in 2020.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Based on the results of several recent randomized trials, European and American guidelines on valvular heart disease management have substantially expanded the indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We present an all-comer data on peri-operative risk profile and in-hospital outcomes from Germany for patients treated by TAVI or isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (iSAVR) in 2020, providing an opportunity to compare study data with data from daily clinical practice.
METHODS: Data concerning all isolated aortic valve procedures performed in Germany in 2020 were retrieved from the mandatory nationwide quality control program. Expected mortality was calculated with the annually revised German Aortic valve score (AKL-score) based on the data of either catheter-based (AKL-CATH) or isolated surgical (AKL-CHIR) aortic valve replacement in Germany from the previous year (2019).
RESULTS: In 2020 21,903 TAVI procedures (20,810 transvascular (TV; vs. 2019: 22.973; - 9.4%), 1093 transapical (TA; vs. 2019: 1413; - 22.6%)) and 6144 (vs. 2019 7905; - 22.5%) iSAVR were performed in Germany. Patients who received TAVI showed a significantly higher perioperative risk profile than patients undergoing iSAVR based on older age and more severe co-morbidities. While in-hospital mortality after TAVI (2.3%) was numerically lower than in 2019 (2.5%), this difference was not significant (p = 0.11). In-hospital mortality after iSAVR was identical in 2020 and 2019 (2.8%) and thus higher than after TAVI (p = 0.003), resulting in an observed expected mortality ratio of 1.02 after TAVI and 1.05 after iSAVR. After exclusion of the emergency procedures, in-hospital mortality did not differ significantly between the groups (TAVI 2.2% vs. iSAVR 1.9%, p = 0.26).
CONCLUSION: Total numbers of both iSAVR and TAVI in Germany were lower in 2020 than in 2019, most likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the relative number of patients treated by TAVI as compared to iSAVR continues to increase. Despite older age and more severe comorbidities compared to patients undergoing iSAVR the in-hospital mortality after TAVI continued to decrease in 2020 and remains significantly lower than after iSAVR.
