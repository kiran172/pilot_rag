Title: Establishing Benchmarks for Airway Replacement: Long-Term Outcomes of Tracheal Autografts in a Large Animal Model.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Airway replacement is a challenging surgical intervention and remains an unmet clinical need. Due to the risk of airway stenosis, anastomotic separation, poor vascularization, and necrosis, it is necessary to establish the gold-standard outcomes of tracheal replacement. In this study, we use a large animal autograft model to assess long-term outcomes following tracheal replacement.
METHODS: Four New Zealand White rabbits underwent tracheal autograft surgery and were observed for 6â€‰months. Clinical and radiographic surveillance were recorded, and grafts were analyzed histologically and radiographically at endpoint.
RESULTS: All animals survived to the endpoint with minimal respiratory symptoms and normal growth rates. No complications were observed. Computed tomography scans of the post-surgical airway demonstrated graft patency at all time points. Histological sections showed no sign of stenosis or necrosis with preservation of the native structure of the trachea.
CONCLUSION: We established benchmarks for airway replacement. Our findings suggest that a rabbit model of tracheal autograft with direct reimplantation is feasible and does not result in graft stenosis or airway collapse.
