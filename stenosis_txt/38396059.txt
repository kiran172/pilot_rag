Title: Normative body mass-adjusted reference ranges of magnetic resonance imaging signs commonly used in diagnosing idiopathic intracranial hypertension in a healthy standard population.

Abstract: Patients with chronic daily headaches (CDH) are often a diagnostic challenge and frequently undergo neuroimaging. One common underlying cause of CDH is idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). However, certain neuroimaging abnormalities that suggest IIH, such as optic nerve sheath diameters (ONSD), pituitary gland height, and venous sinus diameter, require interpretation due to the absence of established normative values. Notably, intracranial pressure is known to varies with age, sex and weight, further complicating the determination of objectively abnormal findings within a specific patient group. This study aims to assist clinical neuroradiologists in differentiating neuroimaging results in CDH by providing weight-adjusted normative values for imaging characteristics of IIH. In addition to age and BMI we here assessed 1924 population-based T1-weighted MRI datasets of healthy participants for relevant MRI aspects of IIH. Association to BMI was analyzed using linear/logistic regression controlled for age and stratified for sex. ONSD was 4.3 mm [2.8; 5.9]/4.6 mm [3.6; 5.7] and diameter of transverse sinus was 4.67 mm [1.6; 6.5]/4.45 mm [3.0; 7.9]. Height of pituitary gland was 5.1 mm [2.2;8.1]/4.6 mm [1.9;7.1] for female and male respectively. Values generally varied with BMI with regression slopes spanning 0.0001 to 0.05 and were therefor presented as normative values stratified by BMI. Protrusion of ocular papilla, empty sella and transverse sinus occlusion were rare in total. Our data show an association between BMI and commonly used MRI features for diagnosing IIH. We provide categorized normative BMI values for ONSD, pituitary gland height, and transverse sinus diameter. This distinction helps objectively identify potential IIH indicators compared to regular population norms, enhancing diagnostic accuracy for suspected IIH patients. Notably, optic nerve head protrusion, empty sella, and transverse sinus occlusion are rare in healthy individuals, solidifying their importance as imaging markers regardless of BMI.
