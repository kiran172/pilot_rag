Title: SIRT6-mediated Runx2 downregulation inhibits osteogenic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells in calcific aortic valve disease.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a progressive cardiovascular disorder involving multiple pathogenesis. Effective pharmacological therapies are currently unavailable. Sirtuin6 (SIRT6) has been shown to protect against aortic valve calcification in CAVD. The exact regulatory mechanism of SIRT6 in osteoblastic differentiation remains to be determined, although it inhibits osteogenic differentiation of aortic valve interstitial cells. We demonstrated that SIRT6 was markedly downregulated in calcific human aortic valves. Mechanistically, SIRT6 suppressed osteogenic differentiation in human aortic valve interstitial cells (HAVICs), as confirmed by loss- and gain-of-function experiments. SIRT6 directly interacted with Runx2, decreased Runx2 acetylation levels, and facilitated Runx2 nuclear export to inhibit the osteoblastic phenotype transition of HAVICs. In addition, the AKT signaling pathway acted upstream of SIRT6. Together, these findings elucidate that SIRT6-mediated Runx2 downregulation inhibits aortic valve calcification and provide novel insights into therapeutic strategies for CAVD.
