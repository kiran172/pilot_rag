Title: Analysis of Risk Factors for Anorectal Stenosis of Perianal Fistulizing Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND To analyze the risk factors of anorectal stenosis associated with perianal fistulizing Crohn's disease (PFCD). MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 139 cases of PFCD from January 2010 to December 2017 at the Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine. They were divided into 2 groups according to whether anorectal stenosis occurred. The possible factors associated with anorectal stenosis of PFCD were selected based on the literature review and clinical observations. Univariate analysis was performed to screen the risk factors of anorectal stenosis, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on these risk factors and factors that were clinically considered to be potentially influential, to screen out the independent risk factors of anorectal stenosis. RESULTS We found that 44 cases (31.7%) of PFCD were associated with anorectal stenosis. Univariate analysis showed that CDAI, lesion location, and age at diagnosis were risk factors for anorectal stenosis of PFCD. Logistic regression analysis showed that mild (fair to good) (OR=3.833, 95% CI: 1.123~13.080) to moderate (poor) (OR=7.345, 95% CI: 1.964~27.474) CDAI and age at diagnosis (OR=1.067, 95% CI: 1.013~1.124) were independent risk factors for anorectal stenosis of PFCD. CONCLUSIONS Higher CDAI and older age at diagnosis appear to confer higher risk of anorectal stenosis associated with PFCD.
