Title: [Complication management after bile duct surgery].

Abstract: Bile leakage and postoperative bile duct strictures or anastomotic stenosis after bilioenteric anastomosis are complex surgical complications, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Detailed diagnostics and sophisticated decision-making is always requiered. Complex liver surgery (redo procedures, nonanatomic resections, etc.) and surgery involving the liver hilum or exposure of the intraparenchymal Glissonean sheath are risk factors for postoperative bile leakage. Bile leakage is defined as a bilirubin concentration at least three times greater than the serum bilirubin measured in an abdominal drainage on or after the third postoperative day or as the need for radiologic intervention because of biliary collection or relaparotomy for bile peritonitis. Therapeutic strategies for bile leakage comprise conservative watch and wait, interventional procedures (endoscopic or percutaneous biliary drainage) and relaparotomy and are selected based on the postoperative onset, output volume and anatomic localization of the bile leak. Conservative treatment and interventional procedures show aÂ high success rate and should therefore be considered as the treatment of choice in most cases. In contrast to bile leakage, bile duct strictures and anastomotic stenosis are rarely observed after surgery and can usually be treated by interventional procedures. This review article discusses situation-dependent specific treatment of postoperative bile leakage as well as bile duct strictures and anastomotic stenosis in detail.
