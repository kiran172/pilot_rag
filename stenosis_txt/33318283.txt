Title: Resection of the arch of cricoid cartilage and circumcision of the tracheal cartilage for subglottic stenosis.

Abstract: Subglottic stenosis is a disease that causes dyspnoea by congenital or acquired stenosis of the cricoid cartilage and trachea. The cause of acquired subglottic stenosis varies. In this case, we present a case of idiopathic subglottic stenosis. Tracheotomies are performed in many cases, but they require long-term insertion of a tracheal cannula and make treatment difficult. In this case study, we performed a tracheoplasty by resection of the arch of cricoid cartilage and circumcision of the tracheal cartilage and implemented a cannula-free observation protocol.
