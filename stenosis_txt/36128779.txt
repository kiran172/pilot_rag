Title: Risk Factors and Imaging Biomarkers Associated With Perioperative Stroke in Pediatric Moyamoya Arteriopathy.

Abstract: Patients with moyamoya arteriopathy are at high risk for developing ischemic stroke in the perioperative period. We sought to evaluate whether preoperative clinical and neuroimaging biomarkers are associated with postoperative stroke and transient ischemic attack in children with moyamoya following revascularization surgery. We performed a retrospective chart review of pediatric patients who underwent revascularization surgery for moyamoya in the last 15 years. Fifty-three patients who underwent 69 surgeries met the inclusion criteria. We recorded clinical predictors of stroke or transient ischemic attack within 7 days following surgery. We used Suzuki stage and Composite Cerebrovascular Stenosis Score to analyze neuroimaging. Significant risk factors for developing postoperative stroke or transient ischemic attack were younger age at surgery (P = .004) and transient ischemic attack less than 1 month prior to surgery (P &lt; .001). Children under 5 and those with recent preoperative ischemic events should be the focus of investigation to evaluate modifiable risk factors and targeted interventions.
