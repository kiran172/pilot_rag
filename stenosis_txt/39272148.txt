Title: Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries in a young seropositive woman with human immunodeficiency virus: a case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Elevated susceptibility to acute myocardial infarction and various cardiovascular diseases has been observed in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus compared with the uninfected population, as demonstrated in numerous studies. The precise mechanism by which human immunodeficiency virus infection heightens the risk of acute myocardial infarction remains elusive. The manifestation of acute coronary syndrome in young patients with human immunodeficiency virus may deviate from the typical, displaying distinct pathophysiological and clinical characteristics. The occurrence of myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries in young patients with human immunodeficiency virus poses diagnostic and treatment challenges.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a 46-year-old African woman with no traditional atherosclerotic risk factors. She was diagnosed with human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection 2Â years prior to her current admission for chest pain. Her troponin levels were elevated, suggestive of acute coronary syndrome. Although coronary angiography ruled out coronary artery stenosis, it revealed mild myocardial bridging in the left anterior descending artery. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed myocardial infarction, indicating a myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries with an apical thrombus in the left ventricle. Following medical treatment, the patient experienced resolution of chest pain and improvement in ST-segment elevation.
CONCLUSIONS: In young female patients without traditional risk factors, human immunodeficiency virus infection is a possible etiological factor for myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries. The likely pathophysiological pathway is superficial endothelial cell denudation as a result of chronic inflammation and immune activation.
