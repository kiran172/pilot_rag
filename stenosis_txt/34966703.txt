Title: Comparison of Drainage Methods After Pyeloplasty in Children: A 14-Year Study.

Abstract: Objective: To summarize our experiences with drainage methods after laparoscopic pyeloplasty with a 14-year study. Methods: We reviewed the data of the 838 children operated on for hydronephrosis due to congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) between July 2007 and July 2020. Patients' demographics, perioperative details, postoperative drainage stents [including double-J stent, percutaneous trans-anastomotic (PU) stent, and trans-uretero-cystic external urethral stent (TEUS)], complications, hospital stay, and long-term follow-up outcomes were analyzed. Long-term follow-up was performed by outpatient visits and telephone follow-up. Moreover, we reviewed the details of nine cases of recurrence after laparoscopic pyeloplasty. Results: Comparison of preoperative general data among the three groups indicated that there was no statistical difference in age, gender, and surgical side of the three groups. Statistical differences were found in the incidence of postoperative complications from the three postoperative drainage method groups, especially the incidence of reoperations (p &lt; 0.01): there were six cases (3.19%) of recurrences in the TEUS group, two cases (0.36%) in the DJ group, and one case (0.93%) in the PU group. In the six recurrent cases from the TEUS group, four cases (44.4%) were found to have stenosis, and two cases (22.2%) have iatrogenic valvular formation. Conclusion: Not all three types of drainage methods are suitable for drainage after pyeloplasty. Based on our findings, TEUS is not recommended.
