Title: Late cholangitis after pancreatoduodenectomy: A common complication with or without anatomical biliary obstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postoperative cholangitis is a common complication after pancreatoduodenectomy that can occur with or without anatomical biliary obstruction. This study aimed to investigate the incidence, diagnosis, treatment, and risk factors of cholangitis after pancreatoduodenectomy.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy in 2 Dutch tertiary pancreatic centers (2010-2019). Primary outcome was postoperative cholangitis, defined as systemic inflammation with abnormal liver tests without another focus of infection, at least 1 month after resection. Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies were evaluated. Two types of postoperative cholangitis were distinguished; obstructive cholangitis (benign stenosis of the hepaticojejunostomy) and nonobstructive cholangitis. Potential risk factors were identified using logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Postoperative cholangitis occurred in 93 of 900 patients (10.3%). Median time to first episode of cholangitis was 8 months (interquartile range 4-16) after pancreatoduodenectomy. Multiple episodes of cholangitis occurred in 44 patients (47.3%) and readmission was necessary in 83 patients (89.2%). No cholangitis-related mortality was observed. Obstructive cholangitis was seen in 37 patients (39.8%) and nonobstructive cholangitis in 56 patients (60.2%). Surgery was performed for cholangitis in 7 patients (7.5%) and consisted of revision of the hepaticojejunostomy or elongation of the biliary limb. Postoperative biliary leakage (odds ratio 2.56; 95% confidence interval 1.42-4.62; P = .0018) was independently associated with postoperative cholangitis.
CONCLUSION: Postoperative cholangitis unrelated to cancer recurrence was seen in 10% of patients after pancreatoduodenectomy. Nonobstructive cholangitis was more common than obstructive cholangitis. Postoperative biliary leakage was an independent risk factor.
