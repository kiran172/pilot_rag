Title: Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome due to unilateral renal artery stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: A tricenarian female with a past medical history of status epilepticus secondary to posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) of unknown etiology presented with a 2-week history of double vision, dizziness, elevated blood pressure, and altered mental status. On hospital day 2, she experienced status epilepticus, during which her blood pressure rose to 240/160 from her baseline of around 140/90. The patient was subsequently intubated for airway protection and transferred to the intensive care unit, where she was started on a nicardipine drip. Due to her history of thrombotic microangiopathy, empiric treatment with plasma exchange and prednisone was started but discontinued when ADAMTS13 came back negative. Urine metanephrines also were found to be negative. Computed tomography angiography of the abdomen showed left renal artery stenosis and stent was placed. Remarkably, over the coming days, her blood pressure normalized, and her neurologic symptoms significantly improved. As a result, antihypertensive medications were titrated down, and the patient was finally provided with a cause of her repetitive, life-threatening episodes of PRES.
