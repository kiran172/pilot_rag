Title: Far lateral lumbar interbody fusion with unilateral pedicle screw fixation and double traversing cages using a biportal endoscopic technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) with a single cage and bilateral pedicle screw fixation results in decreased stability or increased risk of cage displacement Wang and Guo (Comput Methods Biomech Biomed Eng, 24(3):308-319, 6). We succeeded in inserting double traversing cages with unilateral pedicle screw fixation (UPSF) during far lateral TLIF using unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE).
METHOD: We attempted far lateral UBE-TLIF through two small incisions for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis with unilateral stenosis. With the help of novel instruments, far lateral UBE-TLIF with double traversing cages and UPSF was performed under tracheal intubation anaesthesia.
CONCLUSIONS: We successfully performed far lateral UBE-TLIF with double traversing cages and UPSF. This procedure may be an alternative minimally invasive method for treating lumbar instability.
