Title: Survival of left ventricular rupture post mitral valve replacement.

Abstract: A fatal and uncommon complication after mitral valve replacement is left ventricular (LV) rupture. We describe a case of a woman in her 40s with rheumatic heart disease and mitral regurgitation who underwent mitral valve replacement on cardiopulmonary bypass and experienced LV rupture but survived this catastrophe.
