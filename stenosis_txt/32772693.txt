Title: [Update: Management of colonic diverticulitis].

Abstract: Update: Management of colonic diverticulitis Abstract. Several classification systems exist for diverticulosis and diverticulitis. We preferably use the "Classification of Diverticular Disease" (CDD) to grade the severity of disease. This classification is based on imaging by CT scan or ultrasound. The CDD system divides patients into categories with a common therapeutic strategy. Acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is treated by oral or intravenous antibiotics. For the majority of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis, antibiotic therapy might be omitted in favor of a solely symptomatic therapy. Acute diverticulitis complicated by a relevant abscess or a perforation is treated by interventional drainage or surgical therapy. Resection with primary anastomosis replaces more and more resection with end colostomy (Hartmann's procedure). For patients with sepsis, the concept of damage control surgery has been introduced. The indication for elective surgery after conservative treatment of diverticulitis shall be dictated by the degree of the patient's symptoms, rather than the number of conservatively treated episodes of diverticulitis. Persisting complications, as fistulas and stenosis, represent an indication for elective colonic resection.
