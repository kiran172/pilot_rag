Title: Prospective, Multi-center, Single-Arm Study of the Auryon Laser System for Treatment of Below-the-Knee Arteries in Patients With Chronic Limb-Threatening Ischemia: 30-Day Results of the Auryon BTK.

Abstract: The 355 nm Auryon laser (AngioDynamics, Inc., Latham, New York) has been shown to be effective and safe in treating various morphology lesions in the femoropopliteal arteries. There are limited data on the Auryon laser in treating below-the-knee (BTK) arteries in patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia. We present the 30-day efficacy and safety findings from the ongoing Auryon BTK study. Patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia were prospectively enrolled in the Auryon BTK study between March 2022 and February 2023 in 4 US centers after obtaining written informed consent. The primary safety end point included major adverse limb events + postoperative death at 30 days, defined as a composite of all-cause death, major amputation, and target vessel revascularization. Demographic, procedural, angiographic, and outcome data were collected. A total of 60 patients (61 lesions) were treated. The mean age was 74.6 ± 10.3 years, with 65.0% men, 58.3% with diabetes, 43.3% Rutherford Becker (RB) IV, and 56.7% RB V. Of the 61 lesions, 59% had severe calcification, 31.1% were chronic total occlusions, and 90.2% were de novo disease. The baseline diameter stenosis was 80.2 ± 16.4%, after laser 57.4 ± 21.7%, and after final treatment 24.0 ± 23.1% (p <0.0050). The primary performance end point showed a procedure success rate of 37 of 68 (63.8%). Bailout stenting occurred in 1 of 61 lesions (1.6%). The RB category was 100% RB IV or higher at baseline versus 35.3% at 30 days. At 30 days, there was no target vessel revascularization and the patency was 88.9% (Peak Systolic Velocity Ratio (PSVR) ≤2.4). In conclusion, the Auryon laser is safe and relatively effective in treating BTK lesions with minimal complications.
