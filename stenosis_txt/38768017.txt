Title: Transforming congenital heart disease management: Advances in fetal cardiac interventions.

Abstract: This review addresses the transformative advancements in fetal cardiac interventions (FCI) for congenital heart diseases (CHD), with a particular focus on aortic stenosis with evolving hypoplastic left heart syndrome, pulmonary atresia with an intact ventricular septum, and HLHS with an intact atrial septum (HLHS-IAS). We outline the specific FCI techniques employed, the refined criteria for selecting appropriate fetal and maternal candidates, and the promising yet varied outcomes associated with these procedures. Procedural strategies and clinical decision-making are examined as we take into account the fetal pathophysiology and the benefits and risks of early intervention. We highlight the role of multidisciplinary teams in improving technical success and managing immediate procedural complications, which have led to significant improvements in procedural outcomes. Additionally, the review discusses the long-term outcomes, challenges, and future research directions in FCI, emphasizing the necessity for continuous innovation and collaboration across specialties to advance the management of CHD. The integration of new technologies and research findings holds the promise of further enhancing FCI success rates and patient outcomes.
