Title: Biliary metal stents should be placed near the hilar duct in distal malignant biliary stricture patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic biliary drainage using a self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) has been widely performed to treat distal malignant biliary obstruction (DMBO). However, the optimal position of the stent remains unclear.
AIM: To determine the ideal position for SEMS placement.
METHODS: In total, 135 DMBO patients underwent SEMS (uncovered or covered) placement over a ten-year period. A total of 127 patients with biliary obstruction between the junction of the cystic duct and Vater's papilla were enrolled. An SEMS was placed through the upper common bile duct 2 cm from the biliary hilar duct in 83 patients (Hilar group) or near the top of the biliary obstruction in 44 patients (Lower group). Technical and functional success, adverse events, and risk factors for SEMS dysfunction were evaluated.
RESULTS: The stent patency period was significantly longer in the Hilar group than in the Lower group (P value &lt; 0.01). In multivariate analysis, the only statistically significant risk factor for SEMS dysfunction was being in the Lower group (hazard ratio: 9.94, 95% confidence interval: 2.25-44.0, P &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSION: A longer patency period was achieved by positioning the SEMS near the biliary hilar duct.
