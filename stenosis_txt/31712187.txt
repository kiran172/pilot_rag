Title: Utilization of Carbon Dioxide Angiography and Percutaneous Balloon Angioplasty for Treatment of Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) may lead to graft dysfunction and failure. Progressive deterioration of renal allograft function may be exacerbated by contrast-induced nephrotoxicity during iodine contrast administration for renovascular imaging of allografts. We present our institutional experience of endovascular management for TRAS using CO<sub>2</sub> digital subtraction angiography (CO<sub>2</sub>-DSA) and balloon angioplasty to manage failing renal transplants.
METHODS: Four patients with renal allografts from March 2017-May 2018 were referred for graft dysfunction and pending renal transplant failure. Indications for referral included refractory hypertension, decreasing renal functioning, and elevated renovascular systolic velocities.
RESULTS: Median age of the four patients was 41.5 years (22-60 years). There were two male and female patients. Chronic hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus were the most common comorbidities. An average total of 75 mL of CO<sub>2</sub> was used, supplemented with 17.4 mL of iodinated contrast. All patients had improvements in renal function following intervention with a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 25.8% and 21.4%, respectively. We also observed a mean decrease of BUN by 13.6% and creatinine by 37.4%. Additionally, eGFR increased by 37.7%. All allografts survived after surgery, and only one patient required repeat angioplasty for recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: CO<sub>2</sub>-DSA with balloon angioplasty can be successfully utilized to salvage deteriorating kidney allograft function in patients with TRAS.
