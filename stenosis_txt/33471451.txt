Title: VATS tracheal resection and reconstruction.

Abstract: Tracheal resection followed by reconstruction is one of the most difficult procedures in thoracic surgery. Intrathoracic tracheal injuries were usually treated by sternotomy, thoracotomy, or a combination of these techniques. In the last decade, minimally invasive surgical techniques have become an innovative trend in the treatment of thoracic tracheal conditions. Recent authors have proven the feasibility and safety of tracheal operations using video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This video tutorial demonstrates our technique for intrathoracic tracheal resection performed by VATS, using 2 ports, for the resection of postintubation stenosis. We show the steps performed by the surgical team and pay special attention to the maneuvers needed to operate with greater safety and achieve a tension-free reconstruction. This tutorial provides a method for treating this type of tracheal injury. It is of special interest for surgeons who specialize in the airway.
