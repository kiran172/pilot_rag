Title: Innominate artery occlusion: a case study.

Abstract: AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this case report is to evaluate carotid duplex and hemodynamic patterns in an asymptomatic male patient with innominate artery occlusion. Innominate artery occlusion is a rare clinical entity that can lead to a range of cerebrovascular symptoms, including arm claudication, subclavian steal syndrome, and stroke. The case report emphasizes key learning points in diagnosing innominate artery occlusion using imaging and physiological methods.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 64-year-old asymptomatic male patient with a history of carotid bruit, hypertension, coronary artery bypass grafting, aortic aneurysm, hyperlipidemia, mild aortic stenosis, long-term tobacco use, and a body mass index of 24 was referred for a carotid ultrasound.
CONCLUSIONS: Innominate artery occlusion is a rare condition requiring a comprehensive assessment of collateralization before any intervention is attempted. Considering waveform features such as transient end-diastolic flow reversal and tardus parvus, along with brachial pressures and transcranial Doppler, can assist in evaluating the extent of disease.
