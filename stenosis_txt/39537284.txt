Title: Approach and Effects of Percutaneous Mitral Valve Repair in Women.

Abstract: Mitral valve disease, particularly mitral regurgitation (MR), exhibits significant sex-related differences in disease patterns and clinical presentation, as well as in management and outcomes. Lack of sex-specific parameters to assess the hemodynamic impact of MR may contribute to delayed recognition of disease progression and later referral of women for intervention. Globally, rheumatic heart disease accounts for most of the burden of mitral valve pathology and affects more women than men across all age groups but few studies have explored whether there are underlying sex-related differences in pathophysiology, diagnosis, management, and outcomes of interventions such as percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty.
