Title: Reconstruction of convex urethral stoma in a cat with prepubic urethrostomy.

Abstract: An intact, male mixed-breed cat approximately 3 months of age was referred to Iwate University Veterinary Teaching Hospital with dysuria that developed after a traffic accident. At the initial visit, a cystostomy tube was placed as a temporal urinary diversion. Antegrade urethrography revealed severe stenosis of the intrapelvic urethra. A prepubic urethrostomy (PPU) with formation of a convex urethral stoma was performed 22 days after the first visit. Twenty-four months after surgery, the cat could urinate smoothly in a standing position, although a small amount of intermittent leakage was observed immediately after getting up. There was no evidence of peristomal dermatitis. Therefore, the formation of a convex urethral stoma may effectively prevent peristomal dermatitis in cats who undergo PPU.
