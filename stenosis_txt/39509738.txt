Title: Predictive potential of pre-procedural cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers regarding mortality following transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a common heart valve disease, especially in aging populations. While surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the standard treatment, many patients are ineligible. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) offers an alternative, especially for high-risk patients, but is not without complications. Identifying biomarkers that predict post-TAVI mortality is essential for optimizing outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to evaluate the role of cardiac and inflammatory biomarkers in predicting short-term and mid to long-term mortality following TAVI.
METHODS: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Web of Science for studies examining the impact of inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers on mortality following TAVI. Mean differences (MDs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model.
RESULTS: Twenty-eight studies involving 10,560 patients were included, with 1867 in the mortality group. Mortality was significantly associated with higher pre-procedural levels of creatinine (0.41; 95 % CI: [0.35, 0.48]), brain natriuretic peptide (0.58; 95 % CI: [0.43, 0.73]), C-reactive protein (0.55; 95 % CI: [0.45, 0.64]), and white blood cell count (0.18; 95 % CI: [0.06, 0.31]), and lower pre-procedural levels of hemoglobin (-0.49; 95 % CI: [-0.60, -0.38]) and albumin (-0.18; 95 % CI: [-0.24, -0.13]). These associations remained statistically significant in subgroup analyses for both mid to long-term mortality and short-term mortality, except for WBC levels, which were not significantly associated with short-term mortality, and Hb, for which short-term data were insufficient. Platelet count showed no significant difference.
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the importance of inflammatory and cardiac biomarkers in risk stratification and patient management in TAVI procedures.
