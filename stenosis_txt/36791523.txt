Title: Safety and Feasibility of Staged Versus Concomitant Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Mitral Valve Repair After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: The data on the safety and feasibility of performing concomitant or staged transcatheter edge-to-edge repair (TEER) of the mitral valve with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains limited. The Nationwide Readmission Database was used to identify TEER and TAVI procedures from October 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019, using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification administrative data. A total of 627 weighted cases of TEER and TAVI procedures were included in the analysis. Of those cases, 453 underwent staged TEER after TAVI, whereas 174 had concomitant TAVI and TEER during the same admission. Patients who underwent staged procedures were mostly men (64.8%, p = 0.02) and had a higher median age of 85 years (interquartile range 79 to 88) versus 82 years (interquartile range 72 to 86) in the concomitant procedure group. The adjusted propensity-matched mortality rate was similar for staged versus same-admission procedures (6.1% vs 7.0%, p = 0.79). In-hospital complication rates, including acute kidney injury, vascular complications, need for percutaneous coronary intervention, mechanical support, and pacemaker implantation, were higher for the same-admission TEER and TAVI group than TEER performed as a staged procedure. Nonhome facility discharges and length of hospital stay (15 vs 4 days) were also significantly higher for the concomitant same-admission TEER and TAVI groups. In conclusion, there was no difference in in-hospital mortality rate between patients who underwent concomitant or staged TEER and TAVI procedures, whereas complication rates were significantly higher in the concomitant group.
