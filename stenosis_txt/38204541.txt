Title: Hisian Lead Electrical Decay After TAVR Intervention.

Abstract: We report a case of patient with a single-chamber Hisian pacemaker who developed complete atrioventricular block and significant deterioration of the ventricular threshold and sensing after transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Revision of the implantation was required, with ventricular lead extraction and replacement.
