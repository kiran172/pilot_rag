Title: Long-Term Clinical Outcomes of Fractional Flow Reserve-Guided Coronary Artery Revascularization in Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abstract: Fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided percutaneous coronary intervention has shown favorable long-term clinical outcomes. However, limited data exist evaluating the FFR assessment among the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of FFR-guided coronary revascularization in patients with CKD. A total of 242 CKD patients who underwent FFR assessment were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups: revascularization (FFR â‰¤ 0.80) and non-revascularization (FFR &gt; 0.80). The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and target vessel failure (TVF). The key secondary endpoint was TVF. The Cox regression model was used for risk evaluation. With 91% of the ischemic vessels revascularized, the revascularization group had higher risks for both the primary endpoint (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.06; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-3.97; p = 0.030) and key secondary endpoint (aHR: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.10-4.37; p = 0.026), during a median follow-up of 2.9 years. This result was consistent among different CKD severities. In patients with CKD, functional ischemia in coronary artery stenosis was associated with poor clinical outcomes despite coronary revascularization.
