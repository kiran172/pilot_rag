Title: Skeletal Muscle Characteristics May Inform Preprocedural Risk Stratification in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Low psoas muscle mass previously has been associated with mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Evidence from other clinical disciplines suggests that psoas density (PD) may be a better predictor than psoas muscle cross-sectional area indexed to body surface area (PI). The authors hypothesized that PD would be more strongly correlated with patient discharge disposition and survival after TAVR than PI.
DESIGN: The authors performed a single-center, retrospective study of TAVR patients from 2013 to 2016. PI and PD were assessed at the third lumbar spine level using computed tomography imaging. Propensity-score matching was used to investigate the association of PI and PD with discharge disposition and mortality.
SETTING: Tertiary university hospital PARTICIPANTS: Cohort of 245 TAVR patients.
INTERVENTIONS: None MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 245 patients met inclusion criteria. Following propensity score matching, patients with PI &lt;4 cm2/m2 and PD &lt;25 Hounsfield units (HU) were less likely to survive and to be discharged home compared with patients with PI ≥4 cm2/m2 or PD &gt;25 HU. After repeating the propensity score matching with PI as a covariable, PD remained associated with mortality (90 days: odds ratio [OR] 4.59; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.96-10.31, p &lt; 0.001, 1 year: OR 6.14; 95% CI 3.45-28.57, p = 0.01, 3 years: OR 4.55; 95% CI 2.41-40.00, p = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: PD may be more relevant than PI in risk stratification for TAVR patients.
