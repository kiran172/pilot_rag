Title: Cross-over septal flap technique for choanal atresia surgery in two centres: how I do it.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Choanal atresia is a congenital obstruction of the posterior nasal aperture. Endoscopic endonasal surgery has led to successful choanal atresia repair. This paper describes our surgical technique using septal mucosal flaps without the need for stenting.
METHODS: This study comprised a multicentre retrospective review of patient notes. A cross-over septal technique is described, whereby bilateral vertical mucosal incisions are made at the posterior third of the septum, and the atretic plate and posterior vomer are removed. One flap is pedicled superiorly and rotated over the bare skull base and sphenoid bone; the contralateral flap is pedicled inferiorly to cover the exposed vomer remnant and hard palate.
RESULTS: There were 12 patients from 2013 to 2020, aged 0.07-50 years, with a male to female ratio of 1:5. Ten patients had unilateral and two had bilateral choanal atresia. Nine patients had bony choanal atresia, with the remainder mixed.
CONCLUSION: The cross-over technique for choanal atresia has low morbidity and 100 per cent success in our series. The use of mucoperiosteal flaps to cover exposed bone and minimal instrumentation to the lateral nasal wall reduce post-operative stenosis.
