Title: [Mitral Valve Plasty Late after Tetrology of Fallot Repair:Report of a Case].

Abstract: The case was a 32-year-old man. Blalock-Taussig shunt was performed at five months-old for tetralogy of Fallot, and intracardiac repair was performed at four years-old. He was admitted with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Preoperative echocardiography showed vegetations on the mitral valve and severe mitral regurgitation. Severe right heart pressure load findings, pulmonary valve stenosis and regurgitation, and residual ventricular septal defect were also observed. The surgery included mitral valve repair, reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract, pulmonary valve replacement, and closure of the ventricular septal defect. The postoperative course was favorable. The cause of mitral regurgitation was an abnormal chordae tendineae attached to the interventricular septum and valve destruction by infective endocarditis.
