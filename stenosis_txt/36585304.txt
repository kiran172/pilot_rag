Title: Early laparoscopic-assisted surgery is associated with decreased post-operative inflammation and intestinal strictures in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: In 2015, a protocol including early laparoscopy-assisted surgery in the treatment of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) was implemented at our institution. Carbon dioxide insufflation during laparoscopy may have an anti-inflammatory effect. We aimed to compare post-operative outcome after early laparoscopy-assisted surgery and classical laparotomy for NEC.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Charts of premature infants undergoing surgery for NEC (2012-2021) were reviewed. Cases operated by early laparoscopy-assisted surgery (2015-2021) were compared to infants operated for NEC between 2012 and 2015 (laparotomy-NEC). Outcomes were post-operative CRP, need for reintervention, mortality, and the occurrence of post-NEC intestinal strictures. CRP was measured on the day of surgery (POD-0), 2 days (POD-2), and 7 days after surgery (POD-7). Data were compared using contingency tables for categorical variables and Student t-test or Mann-Whitney test for continuous variables.
RESULTS: Infants with NEC operated by early laparoscopy (n = 48) and laparotomy (n = 29) were similar in terms of perforation (60% vs 58%, p = 0.99) and POD-0 CRP (139 vs 124 mg/L, p = 0.94). Delay between first signs of NEC and surgery was shorter in the laparoscopy group (3 vs 6 days, p = 0.004). Early laparoscopy was associated with a lower CRP on POD-2 (108 vs 170, p = 0.005) and POD-7 (37 vs 68, p = 0.002), as well as a lower rate of post-operative intestinal stricture (34% vs 61%, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to being safe and feasible in premature infants, early laparoscopic-assisted surgery was associated with decreased NEC-related post-operative inflammation and strictures. A prospective, randomized study is needed in order to evaluate short and long-term effects of laparoscopy in infants with NEC.
