Title: Iatrogenic Anomalous Origin of the Right Pulmonary Artery From the Aorta: A Rare Complication of Ligation of Aortopulmonary Window.

Abstract: An aortopulmonary window (APW) is a communication between the main pulmonary artery (MPA) and the ascending aorta in the presence of two separate semilunar valves. Surgical strategies described for the management of APW include ligation, division and suturing, patch closure of APW (transaortic or transpulmonary or transwindow), and device closure. Ligation of a type-2 APW can result in stenosis or complete closure of the right pulmonary artery (RPA) off the MPA, while leaving the aorta still opening into the RPA. We describe a delayed presentation of iatrogenic anomalous origin of the RPA from the aorta, post APW ligation, and its management.
