Title: Laryngeal Lymphoid Hyperplasia Presenting As Stridor in Pediatric Age.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Benign lymphoid hyperplasia uncommonly involves the larynx. Involvement of glottis and subglottis is even rare, considering sparse lymphatic supply compared to supraglottis.
CASE REPORT: A young female presented to emergency with worsening breathing difficulty. After securing the airway, she had found to have circumferential glottis and subglottic mucosa covered firm swelling. Histopathological evaluation of the swelling showed it to be benign lymphoid hyperplasia. Coblation assisted excision of the lesion was done, and the patient became asymptomatic without any recurrence.
CONCLUSION: Idiopathic lymphoid hyperplasia is a very rare entity to present as glottis and subglottic lesions. Probably, it's the first case to be reported in the literature as laryngeal involvement sparing the supraglottis.
