Title: Safety of day-case endovascular interventions for peripheral arterial disease in a rural, underserved area.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the safety of endovascular procedures undertaken in a single outpatient center located in a rural, underserved area. Endovascular procedures for Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) have become increasingly common in outpatient settings; their safety is yet to be determined in a rural, underserved area with no stand-by vascular surgeon on site.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective case review of endovascular procedures for the investigation and management of lower extremity PAD between December 2012 and August 2015. Patients were classified by Rutherford score, degree of stenosis and length of lesions. Complications were major (requiring hospitalization) or minor, including perforation, distal embolization, hematoma, and allergic reactions, which could be treated immediately in the catheterization laboratory with no sequelae. Patients were monitored in the facility and followed up using clinical, biochemical and radiological parameters at 24 h and 1 month.
RESULTS: A total of 692 patients underwent endovascular procedures for the investigation and/or treatment of PAD, of which 608 were interventional. Of these patients, 10.20% experienced procedural complications, of which 0.66% were classified as major, including wire retention and retroperitoneal hemorrhage. In total, 99.34% were discharged safely on the same day as the procedure. No adverse events were reported at follow up.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular procedures for PAD can be performed safely in a rural outpatient setting with low complication rates. Most complications are minor and do not require hospitalization. Outpatient procedures for PAD are safe and may widen access to specialist procedures in areas of socio-economic deprivation.
