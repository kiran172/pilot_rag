Title: Stent retriever for Tandem Acute Revascularization Technique (START): a novel technique for the endovascular management of tandem occlusions.

Abstract: Tandem occlusions, characterized by the simultaneous presence of an intracranial large vessel occlusion and extracranial carotid artery stenosis or occlusion,1 pose a unique endovascular challenge.2 3 Typically, the extracranial occlusion is a result of atherosclerotic plaque; however, dissections are also a possible cause. It is currently uncertain whether an intracranial first approach or an extracranial first approach should be employed.4 5 A new technique has been developed which allows for the simultaneous treatment of both the intracranial and the extracranial lesion.6 We describe a variation of this technique: the stent retriever for tandem acute revascularization technique (START), which consists of simultaneously treating the intracranial lesion with stent retriever and contact aspiration, and the extracranial lesion with balloon angioplasty. We present a technical video explaining all the steps of START.(video 1) neurintsurg;16/5/529/V1F1V1Video 1Description and example of the START.
