Title: Thulium Laser Vapoenucleation of the Prostate (ThuVEP) in Men at High Cardiovascular Risk and on Antithrombotic Therapy: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: Bleeding is the most common complication of transurethral resection of the prostate and simple open prostatectomy, especially in men on antiplatelet/anticoagulant therapy. The present study aimed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of thulium laser vapoenucleation of the prostate (ThuVEP) for benign prostatic hyperplasia in patients on chronic antithrombotic medications. Between January 2015 and December 2019, 88 men underwent the procedure under antithrombotic agents in our center. The mean age was 74.7 ± 6.1 years. Median prostate volume was 66.5 mL. Patients on oral anticoagulants were bridged to low-molecular-weight heparin (n = 35). Aspirin (n = 39), clopidogrel (n = 10), and ticlopidine (n = 4) were maintained. Of the patients, 69.3% had an American Society of Anesthesiologists score ≥ 3. Blood loss at 24 h was comparable in all groups. Median catheterization length and postoperative stays were 2 and 3 days respectively. Acute cardiovascular events occurred in 2 patients (2.3%). Of the patients, 4 required prolonged bladder irrigation, 2 required blood transfusions, 1 required a cystoscopy for bleeding control, and 1 required a suprapubic cystostomy for blood clot evacuation. No patients died within 30 days of being discharged. Late complications occurred in 3 (3.8%) patients (1 optical urethrotomy and 1 bladder neck incision for stenosis; 1 acute myocardial infarction). All follow-up visits (1, 6, and 12-month) showed a significant improvement in all urinary parameters compared to baseline. ThuVEP appears to be a feasible surgical option in high-risk patients on antithrombotic regimens, with acceptable postoperative morbidity, good functional outcome, and low incidence of medium-term reoperation rate.
