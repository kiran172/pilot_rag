Title: Supraglottic stenosis as a late complication of radiotherapy: a case report.

Abstract: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is rare and affect mainly men between the fourth and sixth decades of life. The clinic is characterized to be nonspecific and the main complaints or findings related to this disease are: cervical mass, aural dysfunction, and headache. The basis of treatment is radiotherapy that involves a wide field of irradiation of normal tissues, which usually generates sequelae with direct implications for quality of life. We report a case of a nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with radiotherapy and chemotherapy that evolved, after 8 years, into supraglottic stenosis. We emphasize the relevance of clinical follow-up after radiotherapy, particularly due to the late sequelae and the relevance of using radiotherapy devices with a more focal cancer field, in order to minimize complications.
