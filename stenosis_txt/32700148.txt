Title: Predominant classic circular-stapled double-tract reconstruction after totally laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy: safe, feasible, time-saving anastomoses by technical tie-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The double-tract reconstruction (DTR) could be a preferable option in avoiding the postoperative esophageal reflux and anastomotic stenosis during totally laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy (TLPG). An optimal procedure to achieve the DTR in TLPG remains to be established.
METHODS: During March 2018 to April 2019, 15 consecutive patients with gastric cancer in the upper third of the stomach underwent intracorporeal DTR after TLPG at our hospital. The intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy (E-J), gastrojejunostomy (G-J) and jejunojejunostomy (J-J) were, respectively, performed using circular staplers by the Self-Pulling and Holding Purse-String Suture Technique, Intraluminal Poke Technique and U-shaped Parallel Purse-string Suture Technique (Technical Tie-Up). Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics, perioperative details and postoperative outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean operating time was 216.1 ± 18.2 min. Total time for three anastomoses was 49.8 ± 6.1 min, and the time for E-J, G-J, J-J was 22.4 ± 5.0 min, 13 (range 11-16) min, 14.2 ± 2.8 min, respectively. The median proximal and distal resection margins were 2.5 (range 2-4) cm and 6 (range 5-7) cm, respectively, which were all tumor-free in 15 patients. No major complications and mortality occurred. During the median follow-up period of 14 months (range 7 to 20.5 months), there were no postoperative anastomosis-related complications observed, such as anastomotic bleeding, leakage or stenosis. No patients complained the symptoms indicating esophageal reflux and remnant gastritis.
CONCLUSIONS: Predominant classic circular-stapled double-tract reconstruction is safe, feasible and time-saving in TLPG by the technical tie-up.
