Title: Feasibility and efficiency of a new classification based on high-resolution MRI for carotid artery pseudo-occlusion and occlusion: Hybrid revascularization pilot study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Studies on changes in the distal internal carotid artery based on high resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HRMRI) are scarce. Herein, we propose a histological classification system for patients with carotid artery pseudo-occlusion or occlusion based on preoperative HRMRI, for which we evaluated the feasibility and clinical implications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2017 to June 2021, 40 patients with Doppler ultrasound, CTA or MRA suggesting carotid artery occlusion were enrolled in this study. A new classification system based on HRMRI was established and subsequently verified by postoperative specimens. We recorded and analyzed patient characteristics, HRMRI data, recanalization rate, requirements of additional endovascular procedures, complications, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Four histological classifications (type Ⅰ-Ⅳ) were identified. According to our classification system, 20 patients (50.00%) were type I, nine (22.50%) were type II, 7 (17.50%) were type III, and four (10.00%) were type Ⅳ. The success rate of recanalization was 88.89% (32/36) in type I-III patients. Four (44.44%) type Ⅱ patients and five (71.43%) type Ⅲ patients suffered from intraoperative dissection.
CONCLUSION: Patients identified as types I (pseudo-occlusion) and II (thrombotic-occlusion) were able to be treated via hybrid revascularization with relatively low risk, while patients identified as type III (fibrous-occlusion) required more careful treatment. Recanalization is not suitable for patients identified as type Ⅳ. Our proposed classification system based on HRMRI data can be used as an adjunctive guide to predict the technical feasibility and success of revascularization via a hybrid technique.
