Title: Contemporary Surgical and Transcatheter Management of Mitral Annular Calcification.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The presence of mitral annular calcification (MAC) in patients with mitral valve (MV) stenosis or regurgitation is a difficult scenario for surgeons and the heart team. Patients with MAC most often have a significant number of comorbidities that exclude them as surgical candidates. This review highlights the various contemporary techniques available to manage MAC during treatment of the MV.
METHODS: This study is a focused review of the anatomy, pathology, and management of MAC. The review describes the surgical and transcatheter techniques with outcomes, where available.
RESULTS: The incidence of MAC is between 5% and 42% in patients with severe MV disease. The pathophysiology underlying MAC is not yet clear, but it most likely is related to processes of inflammation and atherosclerosis. Surgical techniques can be grouped into those in which the MAC is completely resected en bloc and those in which the MAC is incompletely resected or left in situ. Transcatheter therapies are feasible in some patients, but they have been limited by the anatomic constraints of MAC; most importantly left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and paravalvular regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgeons as part of the heart team now have a range of techniques to manage MAC in those patients with severe MV disease. Transcatheter therapies may increase the options for patients whose surgical risk is too high.
