Title: A four-leaf clover: A case report of quadricuspid aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We present the case of a patient with severe quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) stenosis who underwent treatment with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
CASE SUMMARY: An 87-year-old woman was referred to our department with severe aortic stenosis. Computed tomography angiography revealed a QAV with four separate equal-sized leaflets, similar in appearance to a four-leaf clover. The patient underwent successful implantation of a 23â€‰mm Edwards Sapien 3 transcatheter valve via left transfemoral access. The valve positioning across the aortic annulus was fluoroscopically challenging due to difficulty visualizing all four cusps in only one two-dimensional view and to the position of the left main coronary artery, which was very low. The immediate result of the TAVI was good, with no aortic regurgitation and no coronary damage. Follow-up to 6 months was free of event.
CONCLUSION: This case demonstrates that QAV stenosis can be treated using TAVI with good clinical outcomes.
