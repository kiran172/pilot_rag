Title: Vaginal Stenosis After Gender-affirming Vaginoplasty: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To review the literature and report the incidence of vaginal stenosis (VS) after vaginoplasty and compare the incidence rates by surgical technique and follow-up duration.
METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review according to PRISMA guidelines. Original research on primary vaginoplasty was included. Exclusion criteria included non-English studies, mixed cohorts without subgroup analysis, revision vaginoplasty, and papers without stenosis rates. The search was ran in Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane on September 9, 2022. Stenosis rates were compared with descriptive statistics using SPSS.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine studies with a cumulative 7338 subjects were included. The overall incidence of VS was 5.83% (range 0%-34.2%). Combining VS with introital stenosis (IS) and contracture results in a cumulative incidence of 9.68%. The rate of VS in the penile inversion vaginoplasty subgroup (PIV) was 5.70%, compared to 0.20% in primary intestinal vaginoplasty. The rate of IS in the PIV group was 3.13% and 4.7% in the intestinal vaginoplasty subgroup.
CONCLUSION: The overall rate of VS was 5.83%, which is lower than previously documented. This may be related to the inclusion of more recent studies and analysis limited to primary vaginoplasty. The similar rate of IS in PIV and intestinal vaginoplasty subgroups may be secondary to multiple suture lines and the need for dilation through this anastomosis. Our research demonstrates a need for a standardized definition of VS.
