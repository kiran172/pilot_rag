Title: Risk analysis of intracranial aneurysm rupture based on the arterial segment of origin.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms (IAs) is related to their arterial origin, but whether the different segments of the artery have different risks and act as independent risk factors is still unknown. Our study aimed to investigate the rupture risk of IAs in different arterial segments in a large Chinese cohort.
METHODS: Imaging and clinical data of consecutive patients with IAs diagnosed by Computed Tomography angiography (CTA) from January 2013 to December 2022 were collected. Two neuroradiologists independently identified ruptured and unruptured IAs based on imaging and medical records. The internal carotid artery (ICA), middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), vertebral artery (VA), and posterior cerebral artery (PCA) were segmented according to the Bouthillier and Fischer segmentation methods. Stenoses of the proximal parent vessel were evaluated and documented. The Institutional Review Board (IRB) at Beijing Tiantan Hospital approved this retrospective study.
RESULTS: A total of 3,837 aneurysms {median size 3.5 mm [interquartile range (IQR) 2.6-5.1 mm]; 532 ruptured} were included in this study from 2,968 patients [mean age: 57 years (IQR 50-64); male patients: 1,153]. Ruptured aneurysms were most commonly located in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) (52.9%), anterior communicating artery (ACoA) (33.8%), other locations (33.3%), ACA (22.4%), and basilar artery (BA) (21.4%). The locations with the highest likelihood of rupture were the C7 ICA (21.3%), M2 MCA (24.0%), distal MCA (25.0%), and A2 ACA (28.1%). IAs originating from the C7 (p &lt; 0.001), dM1 (p = 0.022), and dA1 (p = 0.021) segments were independent risk factors for rupture. IAs without stenosis of the proximal parent vessel were associated with a higher risk of rupture (p = 0.023).
CONCLUSION: There are unique associations between the origins of aneurysms from various arterial segments. Aneurysms originating from the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), BA, PICA, A2, dA, C7, and M2 indicate a higher risk of rupture. Aneurysms originating from C4, C5, and C6 indicate a lower risk of rupture. C7 IAs, ACoA IAs, and PICA IAs seem to be independent risk factors.
