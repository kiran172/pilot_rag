Title: Jailed high-pressure balloon technique is superior to jailed wire technique in protecting side branch of coronary bifurcation lesions.

Abstract: Objectives. This study investigated the influence of higher pressure protection with a small diameter balloon of side branch (SB) on bifurcation lesions. Background. Of the different coronary stent implantation techniques, the modified jailed balloon technique has become a viable option for bifurcation lesions. However, there was no detailed study on the relationship between the balloon inflation pressure of the main vessel (MV) and SB. Methods. In this study, we collected information of patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for bifurcated lesions between March 2019 and December 2022. They were divided into two groups according to the operation way: active jailed balloon technique (A-JBT) group and jailed wire technique (JWT) group. Results. A total of 216 patients were enrolled. The A-JBT group had a larger SB stenosis diameter (1.53 ± 0.69 vs. 0.95 ± 0.52, p &lt; .001), the lower degree of stenosis (44.34 ± 18.30 vs. 63.69 ± 17.34, p &lt; .001) compared to the JWT group. However, the JWT group had a higher incidence of SB occlusion (18.0% vs. 1.9%, p &lt; .001) compared to the A-JBT group. Nevertheless, the success rate for both groups was 100%. Conclusions. This novel high inflation pressure and small diameter balloon approach we propose has significant advantages. There is a lower rate of SB occlusion and SB dissection, which is more cost-effective and provides better clinical outcomes for the patient. This method should be considered in the future for treating bifurcation lesions.
