Title: Atypical Aslanger pattern in inferolateral myocardial infarction - A new variant to look out for?

Abstract: We report a case of a 53-year-old male with inferolateral myocardial infarction, presenting an atypical Aslanger pattern on electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG showed ST elevation in leads III, aVR, aVF, and posterior leads, with ST depression in II and V2-V6 with terminal positive T waves. Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of the left circumflex artery (LCx) with significant stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) and right coronary artery (RCA). The LCx was successfully revascularized. This case highlights the importance of recognizing atypical Aslanger patterns, which may indicate multivessel coronary artery disease.
