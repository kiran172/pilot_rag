Title: Renal duplication with ureter duplex not following Meyer-Weigert-Rule with development of a megaureter of the lower ureteral segment due to distal stenosis - A case report.

Abstract: Meyer-Weigert-Rule predicts the draining pattern of duplex ureters in bipolar renal duplications. The upper pole is normally seen as ectopic and therefore dysplastic due to obstruction, whereas the lower pole is related to vesicoureteral reflux. In our case, this rule is violated with uncrossed ureter duplex and a dysplastic lower pole in connection with obstruction.
