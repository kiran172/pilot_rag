Title: [Transthoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair for Malperfusion after Ascending Aortic Replacement for Stanford Type A Acute Aortic Dissection;Report of a Case].

Abstract: A 53-year-old man was presented with Stanford type A acute aortic dissection. We first performed emergency ascending aortic replacement under selective cerebral perfusion with moderate hypothermia. He developed abdominal pain after the surgery. Six days after the 1st surgery, computed tomography revealed that the new entries were located in the distal anastomosis site and the distal aortic arch, and the true lumen of the aorta was obstructed by the false lumen and stenosis. Visceral malperfusion was diagnosed and emergent total debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) was planned. One proximal covered stentgraft and 2 distal bare stents were deployed.
