Title: Aggravating effect of abnormal low-density protein cholesterol level on coronary atherosclerotic plaque in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The abnormal low-density protein cholesterol (LDL-C) level in the development of atherosclerosis is often comorbid in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus(T2DM). This study aimed to investigate the aggravating effect of abnormal LDL-C levels on coronary artery plaques assessed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) in T2DM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study collected 3439 T2DM patients from September 2011 to February 2022. Comparative analysis of differences in coronary plaque characteristics was performed for the patients between the normal LDL-C level group and the abnormal LDL-C level group. Factors with P < 0.1 in the univariable linear regression analyses were included in the multivariable linear stepwise regression.
RESULTS: A total of 2820 eligible T2DM patients were included and identified as the normal LDL-C level group (n = 973) and the abnormal LDL-C level group (n = 1847). Compared with the normal LDL-C level group, both on a per-patient basis and per-segment basis, patients with abnormal LDL-C level showed more calcified plaques, partially calcified plaques, low attenuation plaques, positive remodellings, and spotty calcifications. Multivessel obstructive disease (MVD), nonobstructive stenosis (NOS), obstructive stenosis (OS), plaque involvement degree (PID), segment stenosis score (SSS), and segment involvement scores (SIS) were likely higher in the abnormal LDL-C level group than that in the normal LDL-C level group (P < 0.001). In multivariable linear stepwise regression, the abnormal LDL-C level was validated as an independent positive correlation with high-risk coronary plaques and the degree and extent of stenosis caused by plaques (low attenuation plaque: β = 0.116; positive remodelling: β = 0.138; spotty calcification: β = 0.091; NOS: β = 0.427; OS: β = 0.659: SIS: β = 1.114; SSS: β = 2.987; PID: β = 2.716, all P value < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal LDL-C levels aggravate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in patients with T2DM. Clinical attention deserves to be caught by the tailored identification of cardiovascular risk categories in T2DM individuals and the achievement of the corresponding LDL-C treatment goal.
