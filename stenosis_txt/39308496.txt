Title: Optimal timing of invasive intervention for high-risk non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the immediate, early, and delayed percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) strategies in non-ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) patients with high-risk.
METHODS: Medical records of patients treated at the Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Only patients with complete available information were included. All patients assigned into three groups based on the timing of PCI including immediate (< 2 h), early (2-24 h) and delayed (≥ 24 h) intervention. Multivariable Cox hazards regression and simpler nonlinear models were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 657 patients were included in the study. The median follow-up length was 3.29 (interquartile range: 1.45-4.85) years. Early PCI strategy improved the major adverse cardiac event (MACE) outcome compared to the immediate or delayed PCI strategy. Early PCI, diabetes mellitus, and left main or/and left anterior descending or/and left circumflex stenosis or/and right coronary artery ≥ 99% were predictors for MACE outcome. The optimal timing range for PCI to reduce MACE risk is 3-14 h post-admission. For high-risk NSTEMI patients, early PCI reduced primary clinical outcomes compared to immediate or delayed PCI, and the optimal timing range was 3-14 h post-admission. Delayed PCI was superior for NSTEMI with chronic kidney injury.
CONCLUSIONS: Delayed invasive strategy was helpful to reduce the incidence of MACE for high-risk NSTEMI with chronic kidney injury. An immediate PCI strategy might increase the rate of MACE.
