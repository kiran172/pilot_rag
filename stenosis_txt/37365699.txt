Title: Effect of Truncal-Type Occlusion Based on Multiphase or Single-Phase Computed Tomographic Angiography in Predicting Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis-Related Acute Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether truncal-type occlusion based on multiphase computed tomographic angiography (mpCTA) was more effective for predicting intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis-related occlusion (ICAS-O) than occlusion type based on single-phase computed tomographic angiography (spCTA) in patients with acute ischemic stroke with large-vessel occlusion (AIS-LVO) in the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from 72 patients with AIS-LVO in the MCA between January 2018 and December 2019. The occlusion types included truncal-type and branching-site occlusions. The association between ICAS-O and occlusion type based on the 2 computed tomographic angiography patterns was analyzed, and receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted for assessment. The areas under the curve were compared to determine the difference between the predictive powers of truncal-type occlusion based on mpCTA and spCTA.
RESULTS: Among the 72 patients, 16 were classified as having ICAS-O and 56 as having embolisms. In univariate analysis, truncal-type occlusion was significantly associated with ICAS-O ( P < 0.001 for mpCTA and P = 0.001 for spCTA). After multivariable analysis, truncal-type occlusion based on both mpCTA and spCTA remained independently associated with ICAS-O ( P = 0.002 for mpCTA and P = 0.029 for spCTA). The areas under the curve were 0.821 for mpCTA and 0.683 for spCTA; this difference was statistically significant ( P = 0.024).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with AIS-LVO in the MCA, truncal-type occlusion based on mpCTA enables more accurate detection of ICAS-O than that based on spCTA.
