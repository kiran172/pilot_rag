Title: 30-Day Outcomes With the Portico Transcatheter Heart Valve: Insights From a Multi-Centre Australian Observational Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established therapy for the treatment of aortic valve disease in appropriately selected patients. Previous studies using the self-expanding Portico transcatheter heart valve (THV), (Abbott Structural Heart, St Paul, MN, USA) have demonstrated the technical feasibility of this system albeit in the hands of relatively inexperienced Portico users. The objective of this study was to assess the real-world safety and efficacy of the Portico THV (with and without the FlexNav delivery system, Abbott Structural Heart) at the 30-day timepoint in an Australian cohort.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study was a retrospective real-world cohort analysis of 269 consecutive patients with severe aortic valve disease who underwent TAVI at multiple centres within Australia between February 2015 and April 2021. Of the 269 patients, 51.7% were female, mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score was 5.2 (±6.8) and 98.5% had successful implantations. Thirty (30)-day post-implantation all-cause mortality was observed in one (0.4%) patient, major vascular complications in two (0.7%) patients, more-than-mild paravalvular leak in six (2.2%) patients and requirement for new permanent pacemaker implantation in 27 (10.2%) patients. Haemodynamic parameters at 30 days included mean effective orifice area (EOA) of 2.3 (±0.9) cm2 and mean aortic valve gradient (AVG) of 9.6 (±6.2) mmHg.
CONCLUSION: This analysis of the Portico THV in a real-world setting suggested that the system is associated with satisfactory safety and efficacy parameters. Previously published datasets may not have found similar findings owing to lower operator experience with the Portico THV system.
