Title: Noninvasive Imaging Risk Stratification with Computed Tomography Angiography for Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: The recent technological evolution of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) with improved sensitivity and high negative predictive value has extended its potential applications as a gatekeeper test before invasive coronary angiography. However, the definition of the most accurate diagnostic algorithms comprising CTA as a first-line strategy for ruling out coronary artery disease and the correct management of the patients according to the results of imaging tests still warrant better definition.
