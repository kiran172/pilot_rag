Title: Comparison of Different Techniques of Meatoplasty After Canal Wall Down Mastoidectomy.

Abstract: To compare surgical outcomes with different meatoplasty techniques without removal of a cartilage piece in canal wall down mastoidectomy. Total 61 patients of canal wall down mastoidectomy included in the study where either inferior based flap technique or division in middle technique meatoplasty performed and 2 groups formed. Group A consisted of 33 patients and the inferior based flap technique of meatoplasty used in these patients. Group B consisted of 28 patients and the division in middle technique of meatoplasty used in these patients. Granulations, discharge or stenosis of canal were observed in less than 8% of cases in both the groups. Meatoplasty done without incision or excision of a piece of cartilage from pinna can be achieved with good success rates with either inferiorly based flap technique or division in middle technique.
