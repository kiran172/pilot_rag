Title: Multicentric study applying the european laryngological society classification of benign laryngotracheal stenosis in adults treated by tracheal or cricotracheal resection and anastomosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Introduction and widespread use of cricotracheal resection and anastomosis (CTRA) as routine treatment for high-grade benign laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) led to the need for a new classification system that could accurately predict surgical outcomes by integrating crucial stenosis and patient-related information. In 2015, the European Laryngological Society (ELS) proposed a new classification for benign LTS. We retrospectively tested it in adults treated at three referral centers to assess its reliability in predicting surgical outcomes.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
METHODS: We included 166 adults treated by open tracheal resection and anastomosis (TRA) and CTRA procedures, restaged according to the ELS classification evaluating grade of stenosis (I-IV, Myer-Cotton), number of subsites involved, and presence of systemic comorbidities. We correlated these parameters with decannulation, number of retreatments, and complications.
RESULTS: Final decannulation was predicted by a proposed ELS score ≥ IIIb, history of previous treatment, and length of resection (P < .05). Decannulation was achieved in 99% of patients without and in 88% of patients with surgical complications (P < .01). The incidence of surgical complications was related to the proposed ELS score (P < .01); an ELS score < IIIb showed a lower complication rate compared to patients with a ≥ IIIb score (32.8% vs. 57.7%, P < .01). Additional treatment was required in 73 (44%) patients (mean = 2.7 ± 2.2, range = 1-11). ELS score ≥ IIIb, length of resection, and occurrence of surgical complications predicted the number of such treatments (P < .05, P < .05, and P < .001, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: ELS classification of benign LTS is able to accurately predict success in adult TRA/CTRA procedures and may be helpful in choice of therapy and patient counseling.
