Title: Reintubation in COVID-19 patients: a multicenter observational study in Japan (J-RECOVER study).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Reintubation is not an uncommon occurrence following extubation and discontinuation of mechanical ventilation. In COVID-19 patients, the proportion of reintubation may be higher than that of non-COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, COVID-19 patients may have a higher risk for developing laryngotracheal stenosis, along with a higher proportion of reintubation than in non-COVID-19 patients. Our understanding of the proportion of reintubation in COVID-19 patients is limited in Japan. Additionally, the reasons for reintubation have not been adequately examined in previous studies outside of Japan. Thus, the present study aimed to describe the proportion and causes of reintubation among COVID-19 patients in Japan.
METHODS: This was a multicenter observational study that included 64 participating centers across Japan. This study included mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients who were discharged between April 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020. The outcomes examined were the proportion and causes of reintubation.
RESULTS: A total of 373 patients were eligible for inclusion in the current analysis. The median age of patients was 64 years and 80.4% were male. Reintubation was required for 35 patients (9.4%) and the most common causes for reintubation were respiratory failure (71.4%; n = 25) and laryngotracheal stenosis (8.6%; n = 3).
CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of reintubation among COVID-19 patients in Japan was relatively low. Respiratory failure was the most common cause for reintubation. Reintubation due to laryngotracheal stenosis accounted for only a small fraction of all reintubated COVID-19 patients in Japan.
