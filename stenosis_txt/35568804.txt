Title: Predictors of very early stroke recurrence in the POINT trial population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recent trials of acute secondary prevention in patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) have demonstrated high rates of early recurrence within days of the initial event. Identifying clinical features associated with early recurrence may guide focused management.
METHODS: Using logistic regression applied to the data of the Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial, we evaluated what baseline clinical factors predict outcome events occurring within 7 days of randomization.
RESULTS: In the POINT trial, 181 subjects (3.7%) had early recurrence, defined as primary outcome events within 7 days of trial entry, whereas only 100 outcome events occurred over the remainder of the 90 day trial. Protective effects of dual antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin were seen only as a reduction in these early recurrences, without any impact on later events. In univariate analysis, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, serum glucose, initial carotid imaging results, study cohort (minor stroke or TIA), and treatment assignment were significantly associated with early recurrence. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified a number of factors with significant independent associations with early recurrence, including carotid stenosis or occlusion (Odds Ratio [OR] 2.77; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.78-4.31), cohort (minor stroke versus TIA) (OR 1.86; 95% CI 1.33-2.58), race (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.10-2.25), baseline statin use (OR 0.68; 95% CI 0.49-0.95), systolic blood pressure (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.03-1.18), serum glucose (OR 1.03; 95% CI 1.01-1.05), and age (OR 1.02; 95% CI 1.00-1.03). Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analysis showed a 70% accuracy of the resulting logistic model in predicting early recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Early recurrence is high, and is concentrated in the first 7 days, in patients with minor stroke or TIA. A number of baseline clinical factors, including carotid disease, presentation with minor stroke rather than TIA, race, absence of statin usage, systolic blood pressure, and serum glucose, are independently associated with early event recurrence in the POINT trial population.
