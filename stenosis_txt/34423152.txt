Title: Sutureless closure for the management of gastroschisis.

Abstract: Gastroschisis is a common congenital anomaly in which the midgut fails to return to the abdominal cavity resulting in exposed intestines, which are not covered by a membrane in a neonate. The incidence of gastroschisis has been increasing worldwide resulting in an evolving medical and surgical management. Gastroschisis can be either simple or complicated. Complicated gastroschisis occurs when gastroschisis is associated with gastrointestinal conditions such as intestinal atresia, volvulus, stenosis or perforation. In this instance, the mortality and morbidity of patients significantly increases. Initial management of gastroschisis requires a multi-modal, interdisciplinary approach in order to successfully care for a neonate. Patients should be managed in a neonatal intensive care unit under the care of intensivists, respiratory therapists and pediatric surgeons. Temperature regulation, hydration and protection of the bowel are of the utmost priorities. Surgical management of gastroschisis focuses on reduction of the bowel and closure of the abdominal wall defect. Initially, the defect was closed primarily with suture, however, more recently, a sutureless closure has become prevalent. This, in conjunction with use of a silo, has led to a shift from the operating room and general anesthesia to the bedside. This article aims to discuss the presentation, diagnosis and management of gastroschisis.
