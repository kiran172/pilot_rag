Title: Stent interventional treatment of superior vena cava syndrome with a pacemaker placement complication in an infant.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Epicardial pacemaker is the preferred method for newborns and children under 10 kg of weight. However, its placement presents a high rate of premature failure.
CASE REPORT: The case of an infant requiring placement of pacemaker by congenital atrioventricular block with prenatal diagnosis is described. The patient showed critical stenosis of the superior vena cava as a complication. Interventional resolution using a stent at the site of stenosis corrected the superior vena cava syndrome effectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This case represents a clinically viable alternative for the treatment of superior vena cava syndrome, which can be used after other conventional therapies have failed.
