Title: Guidelines for endoscopic balloon dilation in treating Crohn's disease-associated small intestinal strictures (supplement to the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Enteroscopy).

Abstract: Balloon-assisted enteroscopy allows endoscopic treatments in the deeper segments of the small bowel. Endoscopic balloon dilation has become a popular minimally invasive alternative for the treatment of Crohn's disease-associated small intestinal strictures. As a supplement to the Clinical Practice Guidelines for Enteroscopy, the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society's Working Committee has developed the present "Guidelines for endoscopic balloon dilation in treating Crohn's disease-associated small intestinal strictures," based on new scientific techniques and evidence. The guidelines cover standard procedures for the insertion route of the balloon endoscope, bowel preparation, indications, procedure-related complications, efficacy, target diameter and duration, management of multiple strictures, and the current state of combined and alternative treatments. Unresolved future research questions are also listed in this guideline.
