Title: Severely calcified bicuspid aortic valve stenosis after valve-sparing root replacement: A word of caution.

Abstract: A 58-year-old man was admitted for reoperation for severe aortic stenosis in a previously preserved bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). He had undergone valve-sparing root replacement (VSSR) for dilated aortic root 6 years ago. Transesophageal echocardiography following VSSR showed good valve function with no aortic incompetence. However, the BAV became stenotic causing shortness of breath. At reoperation, the preserved BAV was noted to be fibrotic and calcified and had a fixed rigid small orifice. It was replaced with a biological valve plus root enlargement. Macroscopic finding showed thickening of the cusps and nodular calcification. Microscopic examination revealed severe nodular calcification.
