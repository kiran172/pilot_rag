Title: Thoracoscopic esophagoesophagostomy for a refractory stricture in a patient with esophageal atresia.

Abstract: Anastomosis stricture is a well-known complication after esophageal atresia repair. Endoscopic dilatation is the gold standard treatment for esophageal stenosis. However, surgical interventions are indicated for refractory cases. We present a 2-year-old girl with esophageal stricture refractory to regular endoscopic dilatation after esophageal atresia repair that underwent thoracoscopic stricture resection and reanastomosis. Although thoracoscopic approach is widely used for esophageal atresia repair, this approach has not been used before for the treatment of anastomosis stricture.
