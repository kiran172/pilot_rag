Title: Predictors of long-term outcomes after catheter-directed thrombolysis combined with stent implantation in acute deep vein thrombosis secondary to iliac vein compression.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to analyze predictive factors for long-term clinical outcomes after catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) combined with stent implantation for acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) secondary to iliac vein compression (IVC). A retrospective analysis was performed to review clinical data and follow-up information on 52 patients who underwent CDT combined with stent implantation for acute DVT secondary to IVC from June 2015 to March 2020. Clinical outcomes including stent patency and incidence of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) were investigated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. All included patients were categorized into 2 groups according to the presence of PTS. Potential risk factors, including age, gender, degree of iliac vein stenosis, time from onset to treatment, dosage of thrombolytic agent, stent extending below the inguinal ligament, and duration of anticoagulation for PTS were evaluated using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Over a median follow-up of 24 months, 4 individuals underwent reintervention due to in-stent stenosis or stent compression. Primary stent patency was 98.1% at 1 month, 94.2% at 6 months, 90.4% at 12 months, and 88.5% at 24 months. Freedom from PTS was 98.1% at 6 months, 84.6% at 12 months, and 75% at 24 months. No treatment-related mortality or morbidity was observed. Based on the development of PTS, 13 patients with PTS were classified into group A and 39 patients without PTS were regarded as group B. Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, key prognostic factors for PTS were degree of iliac vein stenosis and time from onset to treatment. CDT combined with stent implantation is safe and effective for acute DVT secondary to IVC in the long-term perspective. Severe iliac vein stenosis and longer period from onset to treatment may be associated with a higher risk of PTS.
