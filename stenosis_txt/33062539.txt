Title: Outcomes of Urgent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients With Acute Decompensated Heart Failure: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: Background Data on urgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) as rescue therapy for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) are limited. We sought to investigate the outcomes of patients who underwent urgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a single institution. Methods This is a retrospective cohort study of 602 patients with a history of heart failure (HF) due to AS who underwent TAVR between April 2012 and July 2017. We stratified patient cohort into urgent (n=139) and elective (n=463) TAVR. Urgent TAVR was defined as patients who were admitted for ADHF and underwent TAVR during the same hospitalization. Patients that underwent urgent TAVR for other reasons were excluded. Results Rates of postoperative intra-aortic balloon pump requirement, atrial fibrillation, dialysis requirement, vascular complications, and stroke were similar between the two groups. Compared with elective TAVR, patients undergoing urgent TAVR had a higher rateÂ of cardiac arrest (5.7% vs 1.3%, p=0.005), longer length of stay (LOS) (11 vs. 5, p<0.001), and significant 30-day mortality (8.6% vs 4.1%, HR 2.1, 95% CI 1.04-4.22). Patients who underwent urgent TAVR were also associated with long-term mortality (Log-rank p = 0.0162). Conclusions In our study, urgent TAVR for ADHF was associated with both short-term and long-term mortality as compared to elective TAVR. Further randomized studies are needed to investigate the appropriate management of this population.
