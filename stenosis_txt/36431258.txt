Title: The Efficacy and Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants versus Standard of Care in Patients without an Indication of Anti-Coagulants after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now considered the mainstay of aortic stenosis management; however, the optimal antithrombotic therapy in patent without indications for an oral anticoagulant (OAC) is yet to be identified. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) treatment versus the standard of care in patients without indications of OACs after TAVR. We synthesized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from Web of Science, SCOPUS, EMBASE, PubMed, and Cochrane until 18 August 2022. We used the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes with the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI). We registered our protocol in PROSPERO with ID: CRD42022357027. Three RCTs with 2922 patients were identified. DOACs were significantly associated with higher incidence of all-cause mortality (RR: 1.68 with 95% CI [1.22, 2.30], p = 0.001), mortality due to non-cardiovascular causes (RR: 2.34 with 95% CI [1.36, 4.02], p = 0.002), and the composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke (RR: 1.41 with 95% CI [1.13, 1.76], p = 0.002). However, DOACs were associated with decreased incidence of reduced leaflet motion (RLM) (RR: 0.19 with 95% CI [0.09, 0.41], p = 0.0001) and hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) (RR: 0.50 with 95% CI [0.36, 0.70], p = 0.0001). DOACs were effective to reduce RLM and HALT; however, the clinical effect of this is still controversial. DOACs were associated with worse efficacy and safety outcomes, including all-cause mortality. Further RCTs investigating the optimal antithrombotic regimen after TAVR.
