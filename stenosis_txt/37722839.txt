Title: Early Outcomes of Pulmonary Valve Replacement With the Edwards Inspiris Resilia Pericardial Bioprosthesis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Controversy regarding the optimal pulmonary valve substitute remains, with no approved surgical valve for pulmonary valve replacement (PVR). Furthermore, unfavorable anatomy often precludes transcatheter PVR in patients with congenital heart disease. We therefore sought to evaluate the feasibility of the Edwards Inspiris pericardial aortic bioprosthesis in the pulmonary position in pediatric and adult patients requiring PVR.
METHODS: Data from consecutive patients who underwent PVR from February 2019 to February 2021 at our institution were retrospectively reviewed. Postoperative adverse events included paravalvular or transvalvular leak, endocarditis, explant, thromboembolism, valve thrombosis, valve-related bleeding, hemolysis, and structural valve degeneration. Progression of valve gradients was assessed from discharge to 30 days and one year.
RESULTS: Of 24 patients with median age of 26 years (interquartile range [IQR]: 17-33; range: 4-60 years), 22 (91.7%) patients had previously undergone tetralogy of Fallot repair and 2 (8.3%) patients had undergone double-outlet right ventricle repair in the neonatal period or infancy. All patients had at least mild right ventricular (RV) dilatation (median RV end-diastolic volume index 161.4, IQR: 152.3-183.5â€…mL/m2) and at least moderate pulmonary insufficiency (95.8%) or stenosis (8.3%). Median cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp times were 71 (IQR: 63-101) min and 66 (IQR: 60-114) min, respectively. At a median postoperative follow-up of 2.5 years (IQR: 1.4-2.6; range: 1.0-3.0 years), there were no mortalities, valve-related reoperations, or adverse events. Postoperative valve gradients and the severity of pulmonary regurgitation did not change significantly over time.
CONCLUSIONS: At short-term follow-up, the bioprosthesis in this study demonstrated excellent safety and effectiveness for PVR. Further studies with longer follow-up are warranted.
