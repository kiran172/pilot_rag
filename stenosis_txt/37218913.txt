Title: Advantages of Multiposition Scanning in Echocardiographic Assessment of the Severity of Discordant Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of severity of discordant aortic stenosis (AS) assessment using multiposition scanning and the standard apical window.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients (n = 104) underwent preoperative transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and were ranked according to the degree of AS severity. The reproducibility feasibility of the right parasternal window (RPW) was 75.0% (n = 78). The mean age of the patients was 64 years, and 40 (51.3%) were female. In 25 cases, low gradients were identified from the apical window not corresponding to the visual structural changes in the aortic valve, or disagreement between the velocity and calculated parameters was detected. Patients were divided into two groups: concordant AS (n = 56; 71.8%) and discordant AS (n = 22; 28.2%). Three individuals were excluded from the discordant AS group due to the presence of moderate stenosis.
RESULTS: Based on the comparative analysis of transvalvular flow velocities obtained from multiposition scanning, the concordance group showed agreement between the velocity and calculated parameters. We observed an increase in the mean transvalvular pressure gradient (ΔP<sub>mean</sub>) and peak aortic jet velocity (V<sub>max</sub>), ΔP<sub>mean</sub> in 95.5% of patients, velocity time integral of transvalvular flow (VTI AV) in 90.9% of patients, and a decrease in aortic valve area (AVA) and indexed AVA in 90.9% of patients after applying RPW in all patients with discordant AS. The use of RPW allowed the reclassification of AS severity from discordant to concordant high-gradient AS in 88% of low-gradient AS cases.
CONCLUSION: Underestimation of flow velocity and overestimation of AVA using the apical window may lead to misclassification of AS. The use of RPW helps to match the degree of AS severity with the velocity characteristics and reduce the number of low-gradient AS cases.
