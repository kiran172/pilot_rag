Title: Re-administration of nivolumab after immune checkpoint inhibitor-induced cholangitis: the first reported case.

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) cause various immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We encountered a patient in whom nivolumab was re-administered effectively and safely treat laryngeal cancer after nivolumab-induced cholangitis. A 60-year-old man with metastatic laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma received 3rd-line treatment with nivolumab. After the 8th cycle of chemotherapy, laboratory tests revealed grade 3 elevations of gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase. Computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography showed diffuse hypertrophy, dilation of bile ducts, and intrahepatic bile ducts with irregular walls and mild stenosis. The histologic findings of a liver biopsy revealed portal inflammation and cholangitis, mainly composed of T cell infiltration. We diagnosed nivolumab-induced cholangitis and administered 30 mg of prednisolone (0.5 mg/kg) and ursodeoxycholic acid (600 mg) per day. Although we initiated 4th-line cytotoxic anticancer drug after the cholangitis improved, the laryngeal cancer progressed rapidly. Based on the improvement in hematologic parameters, radiologic imaging, and pathologic findings, we cautiously restarted nivolumab. During the 30 months after re-administration of nivolumab, the cholangitis did not recur and the disease was well-controlled.
