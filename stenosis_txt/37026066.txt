Title: Retrospective evaluation of a hand-sewn side-to-side intestinal anastomosis technique in dogs and cats.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hand-sewn intestinal resection and anastomosis are commonly performed in veterinary medicine. The outcome of the hand-sewn side-to-side anastomosis (SSA) technique has never been described and compared to other techniques in dogs and cats.
AIM: The study aims to describe the side-to-side hand-sewn anastomosis technique in small animals and to compare it with the end-to-end technique.
METHODS: A retrospective evaluation of the clinical records of dogs and cats that underwent enterectomy between 2000 and 2020 and were treated with side-to-side or end-to-end anastomosis (EEA) was performed.
RESULTS: Of the 52 dogs and 16 cats included in the study, 19 dogs and 6 cats received an SSA, and the remaining received an EEA. No intraoperative complication was reported. However, short-term complication rates were comparable, and mortality rates in the EEA group were higher. At the same time, stenosis was a frequent complication of SSA and was never reported following EEA.
CONCLUSION: End-to-end technique remains the gold standard for hand-sewn intestinal anastomosis in small animals. However, SSA can be considered for selected cases with acceptable morbidity and mortality rates.
