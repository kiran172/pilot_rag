Title: Spontaneous radial nerve palsy with hourglass-like constriction.

Abstract: Hourglass-like constriction (HLC) is an uncommon spontaneous mononeuropathy that is typically characterised by a sudden onset of pain followed by palsy, affecting branches of the radial (posterior interosseous nerve) and median nerves (anterior interosseous nerve). HLC of the radial nerve (RN) is rare, with only a few reported cases. Here, we report a case of a man who presented with acute wrist and finger drop due to the HLC of the RN. Surgery was recommended 5 months after clinical observation, when the lesion was resected and primarily repaired, resulting in satisfactory recovery. There is still much that remains unknown about HLC, especially for RN. The current understanding points out an inflammatory disease that should be treated conservatively for 3-7 months. The surgical technique depends mostly on the severity and extent of constriction; however, considering only RN constrictions, primary repair by neurorrhaphy or nerve grafts resulted in better functional outcomes.
