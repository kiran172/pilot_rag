Title: Dynamic cardiac computed tomography characteristics of double-chambered right ventricle.

Abstract: To introduce image characteristics of double-chambered right ventricle on cardiac computed tomography and set a diagnostic criterion for the diagnosis. We retrospectively collected and measured the right ventricular constrictive ratio on computed tomography images in children who had simple ventricular septal defects in the past 10 years, because double-chambered right ventricle is often associated with ventricular septal defects. The right ventricular constrictive ratio was defined as the subinfundibular cross-sectional intraluminal area during end-systole divided by the area during end-diastole in the same patient. We compared the right ventricular constrictive ratio between subjects with concomitant double-chambered right ventricle and those without. 52 children were included, and 23 (44.2%) of them have concomitant double-chambered right ventricle. In most cases (n = 21; 91.3%), the hypertrophied muscular bundles occur just inferior to the level of the supraventricular crest in the right ventricle. Mean right ventricular constrictive ratio in patients with double-chambered right ventricle (15%) was significantly smaller than that without (29%). A cut-off value of a right ventricular constrictive ratio less than 20.1% was established to diagnose double-chambered right ventricle with an 89.7% sensitivity and 78. 3% specificity. Right ventricular constrictive ratio can be a valuable asset for the preoperative diagnosis of double-chambered right ventricle with cardiac computed tomography.
