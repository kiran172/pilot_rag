Title: A systematic review of existing appropriate use criteria in cardiovascular disease from the last 15 years.

Abstract: Appropriate use criteria (AUC) aim to impact the provision of high-value care. This scoping review identified AUC regarding the procedural and operative treatment of cardiovascular disease and described the evolution of AUC in this space over time, including changes in the focus, strategy, and language of AUC. The summative presentation of these AUC identifies elements of AUC that may lead to successes in, and barriers to, implementation across disease processes, specialties, and societies. AUC topics include coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, valvular disease, venous disease, renal artery stenosis, and mesenteric ischemia, among others.
