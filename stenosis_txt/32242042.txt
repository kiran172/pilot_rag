Title: Clinical significance of serum concentrations of neuregulin-4, in acute coronary syndrome.

Abstract: Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is closely associated with an increased risk of death. Nrg4, a novel adipocytokine, has negative correlations with indicators of metabolic syndrome. Here, we investigated whether circulating Nrg4 associates with the prevalence of ACS. In this case-control study, a total of 257 subjects (144 patients with ACS and 56 patients diagnosed with stable angina pectoris (SAP)) compared to 57 healthy controls. Serum Nrg4 and hs-CRP concentrations were determined by ELISA. The associations of circulating Nrg4 with other clinical parameters were also analyzed. Serum levels of Nrg4 were lower in patients compared to the control subjects (0.7 ± 0.53 ng/mL versus 1.1 ± 0.9 ng/mL, P = 0.018). There was a significant association between higher Nrg4 level and lower risk of ACS (OR = 0.15; 95%CI = 0.02-0.9; P = 0.046), but not with SAP. This association was independent of potential confounders including traditional cardiovascular risk factors. The distribution of patients with no, 1, 2 and 3 vessel stenosis was significantly different in Nrg4 quartiles. Patients in the lower quartile of Nrg4 were more likely to experience 3 vessel diseases. Serum levels of Nrg4 correlated negatively with HDL-cholesterol in ACS patients. Decreased serum levels of Nrg4 might be an independent risk factor for ACS.
