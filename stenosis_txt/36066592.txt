Title: [Endoscopic management of complications of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract].

Abstract: Even when wide-ranging measures for avoidance of complications by improved techniques, training and many other activities are undertaken, postoperative and postinterventional complications still represent a daily problem in clinical medicine. The outcome of the patient is not uncommonly decided by the management of the complications. The failure to rescue or to control complications is increasingly recognized as being decisive for the success of treatment. This article therefore provides a current overview of the endoscopic management of complications of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. It describes when endoscopy can be used to detect or exclude a complication. The most important principles of treatment including the indications, limits of performance and technique are presented.
