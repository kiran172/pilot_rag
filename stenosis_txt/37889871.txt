Title: Incidence of Airway Abnormalities in Children With Craniosynostosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Children with syndromic craniosynostosis are known to have a high propensity for associated airway abnormalities. However, this has not been investigated using a large-scale national database.
METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, the 2016 Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project Kid's Inpatient Database was queried for craniosynostosis patients. Data on demographics, airway diagnoses, and comorbidities were analyzed.
RESULTS: Four thousand nine hundred fourteen children with craniosynostosis with a mean age of 1.7Â±3.6 years were identified. Of these, 51% were female and 136 children had an associated syndrome. Choanal atresia was present in 31% of patients with an associated syndrome versus 2.5% without. Syndromic patients are 4.59 times more likely (95% CI 2.65-7.94) to have airway anomalies than nonsyndromic patients. After age and sex adjustment, craniosynostosis patients have higher likelihoods of presenting with other anomalies, with syndromic having higher incidences: 5.23 times (95% CI 2.63-10.39) more likely to have laryngomalacia, 18.30 times (95% CI 3.27-102.36) more likely to have tracheal stenosis, and 4.58 times (95% CI 1.36- 15.43) more likely to have tracheomalacia. Incidence of tracheostomy was 5.84 times (95% CI 3.77-9.04) higher in syndromic patients with craniosynostosis. Tracheostomy rates were 28.4% and 4.6% in craniosynostosis patients with and without associated syndrome, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Syndromic craniosynostosis patients had significantly higher incidences of choanal atresia and other airway anomalies. Given a high incidence of airway anomalies, syndromic craniosynostosis patients likely warrant routine airway evaluation. Providers should also be vigilant about airway evaluation in patients with nonsyndromic craniosynostosis when aerodigestive symptoms arise.
