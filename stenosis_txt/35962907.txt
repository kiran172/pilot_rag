Title: Non-transecting dorsal mucosal anastomosis plus ventral oral graft for the treatment of urethral bulbar strictures: single surgeon experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report our experience with the non-transecting dorsal mucosal anastomosis plus ventral oral graft urethroplasty (NTAVOG) for the repair of tight bulbar urethral strictures.
METHODS: Data of 68 men with tight bulbar strictures underwent NTAVOG urethroplasty between 2012 and 2019 were retrospectively revised. The urethra was opened ventrally; the dorsal scarred mucosa was excised preserving the spongiosum; the mobilized mucosal edges were anastomosed to recreate the dorsal urethral plate; the repaired urethral plate was augmented by the ventral oral graft and the spongiosum was closed over it. Successful urethral reconstruction was defined as normal voiding without the need for any postoperative procedure. Sexual function was investigated using a validated questionnaire.
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 58 months (IQR 38-63) and mean stricture length was 1 cm (IQR 1-1.5). Of 68 cases, 56 (82.4%) were successful and 12 (17.6%) were failures requiring re-treatment. At multivariable analysis, no preoperative factor was significantly associated with recurrence. None of the preoperatively sexually active 53 patients reported postoperative erectile impairment and all were satisfied with their sexual life. The main limitation is the retrospective design.
CONCLUSIONS: In cases of tight bulbar stricture, the NTAVOG urethroplasty provides adequate urethral augmentation by preserving the spongiosum and avoiding postoperative sexual complications. We presented a series of patients undergone non-transecting dorsal anastomosis plus ventral oral graft urethroplasty for tight bulbar stricture. This treatment seems to be safe and with limited postoperative complications thanks to the preservation of the corpus spongiosum.
