Title: Pulmonary artery dissection secondary to ventricular septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis.

Abstract: The aortic short axis view demonstrated the widening of the pulmonary artery and the membrane-like echo in the pulmonary artery divided it into true lumen and false lumen. And the flow of the ruptured openings on the band-like echo was clearly revealed by Color Doppler.
