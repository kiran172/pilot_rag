Title: Navigating Congenital Nasal Obstruction: A Contemporary Surgical Paradigm.

Abstract: An uncommon form of nasal airway obstruction in a newborn with respiratory distress manifestations that needs prompt surgical correction when medical therapy cannot address the problem adequately. In this case study, two newborns were diagnosed with congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) following a CT paranasal sinuses when the infant demonstrated persistent symptoms of upper airway obstruction. The narrowing of the nasal pyriform aperture, with a mean width of 0.65 cm in these newborns, was insufficient to allow breathing through the nostrils. Bedsides flexible endoscopy examinations revealed laryngomalacia in both of these infants. A supraglottoplasty, surgical nasal dilation, and stenting were performed without requiring a sublabial drill out of the pyriform aperture, allowing total resolution of the initial respiratory symptoms. Thus, a successful nasal enlargement was accomplished. During the post-operative follow-up period, no incurrences were observed. Both patients with CNPAS were successfully treated with nasal dilatation and nasal stenting instead of the traditional pyriform aperture bone removal by a sublabial approach. Despite being a small series, it demonstrates that nasal dilatation and stenting may be considered an alternate procedure in selectiveÂ CNPAS cases because it lowers the risk of open surgery and presumably offers an effective management option.
