Title: In vivo validation of resting full-cycle ratio and diastolic pressure ratio: simultaneous measurement with instantaneous wave-free ratio.

Abstract: The diastolic pressure ratio (dPR) and resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) are considered to be almost identical to the instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) in the retrospective analysis of pooled data. The aim of this study was to investigate the direct comparison of iFR and these new resting indexes in real world practice. Two pressure wires were inserted and placed in the distal part of the same coronary artery. The measurement of the iFR and the other resting indexes was performed simultaneously. A total of 54 lesions from 23 patients were subject to physiological study. In 49 lesions, iFR and other resting indexes were also measured in hyperemic conditions. The general correlation between iFR and other resting indexes was excellent in both resting and hyperemic conditions (r2 = 0.99; mean difference - 0.001 ± 0.021; p &lt; 0.001; and r2 = 0.99; mean difference - 0.012 ± 0.025; p &lt; 0.001, respectively). This correlation was maintained in various subgroup analyses. A diagnostic change between iFR and other resting indexes occurred in three cases (3%) when a fixed cut-off point (≤ 0.89) was applied. There was no diagnostic change when a hybrid zone (0.86 ≤ iFR ≤ 0.93) was considered. The new resting indexes and iFR showed very high correlation in real world practice. A diagnostic change only occurred in three cases (3%) when a fixed cut-off point (≤ 0.89) was applied.
