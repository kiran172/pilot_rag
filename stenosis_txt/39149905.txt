Title: Outcomes of balloon-assisted maturation with large-diameter balloons.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Balloon-assisted maturation (BAM) is a well-established technique for maturation of inadequate arteriovenous fistulas (AVF). The objective of this study was to evaluate outcomes of initial BAM using large-diameter angioplasty balloons.
METHODS: Charts of patients who underwent BAM between 2018 and 2021 at a single academic institution were reviewed. AVF maturation rate was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included procedural complications, re-intervention rates, post-procedure vein diameter, and time to catheter-free hemodialysis (HD). Outcomes of patients that underwent initial BAM with ⩾7 mm diameter balloons (Group I) were compared to those of patients that had initial BAM with <7 mm balloons (Group II).
RESULTS: Group I (n = 149) was a significantly younger cohort and had more men compared to Group II (n = 90). There were no significant differences associated with procedural details and complication rates. Median vein diameter was larger (5.9 mm, IQR: 5-6.4) in Group I compared to Group II (5.1 mm, IQR: 4.2-5.9; p = 0.03) on post-procedure Duplex ultrasound. There was also a higher incidence of vein stenosis in Group II. The overall maturation rate was higher in Group I (97% vs 88%, p = 0.003), and a larger proportion of patients in Group II required more than one BAM to achieve maturation (33% vs 16%, p = 0.002). The median time to catheter-free HD after first BAM was 29 days (IQR: 19-47) in Group I and 42 days (IQR: 24-75) in Group II (p = 0.002). At 60 days after first BAM, the incidence of catheter-free HD was 83% in Group I versus 67% in Group II (p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates that the ability to utilize large angioplasty balloons during initial BAM is associated with higher rates of AVF maturation with fewer re-interventions and shorter time to catheter-free dialysis. AVFs that can tolerate this procedure often have more favorable baseline characteristics.
