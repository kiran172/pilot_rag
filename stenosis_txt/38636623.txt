Title: Prosthesis Infolding Incidence and Short-Term Outcomes in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Using Evolut Self-Expandable Device: A Multicenter Study.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an established treatment strategy in aortic valve disease. Infolding, as a nonuniform expansion of the prosthesis leading to introflection of part of the device circumference, is a complication specific to self-expandable prostheses. The aim of the study is to determine incidence, predictors, treatment strategy, and outcomes of infolding during Medtronic Evolut TAVI (Minneapolis, MN, US). Between January 2018 and March 2022, all patients treated with Evolut TAVI were included in a multicenter observational retrospective study. According to the occurrence of infolding, the enrolled cohort was divided into 2 groups; periprocedural characteristics and 30-day outcomes were compared. A total of 1,470 patients were included; 23 infolding cases (1.6%) were detected. Preprocedural imaging showed larger aortic anatomy and greater calcium burden in the infolding group. Infolding occurred mostly with Evolut Pro+ and size 34 mm and was diagnosed before full prosthesis release in 78.3%. The rate of moderate-to-severe paravalvular regurgitation was higher in the infolding group (21.7% vs 1.9%, p <0.001). Short-term follow-up showed greater all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (respectively, 4.3% vs 0.7% and 4.3% vs 0.6%, p <0.05) and higher rate of pacemaker implantation (33.3% vs 15.7%, p = 0.042) in case of infolding. High right cusp calcium score and resheathing maneuvers were independent predictors of infolding. In conclusion, prosthesis infolding is a TAVI complication burdened by worse cardiovascular outcomes. Prompt intraprocedural infolding diagnosis is pivotal, especially in case of great native valve calcium burden and resheathing maneuvers, to safely overcome this complication by prosthesis recapture or postdilation.
