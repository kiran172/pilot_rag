Title: Diagnosis and Treatment of a Nonhealing Wound Secondary to a Reepithelialized Hair Tourniquet With Ultrasound.

Abstract: A 9-month-old girl presented with a chronic wound on the dorsal surface of her toe that failed 6 months of medical management. Due to the prolonged clinical course, there was a concern for a foreign body. Intraoperative ultrasound was utilized to identify linear echogenic structures, which were excised and consistent with reepithelialized hairs secondary to hair-thread tourniquet syndrome. There were also erosive changes to the underlying phalanx. Intraoperative ultrasound was also used to guide the incision size and confirm the complete removal of the hairs.
