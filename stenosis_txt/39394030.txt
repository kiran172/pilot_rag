Title: Outcomes of the Modified Warden Procedure for Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection Drainage to a High Location in the Superior Vena Cava.

Abstract: AIM: To report the safety and effectiveness of a modified Warden procedure.
METHOD: Twenty-six (26) patients underwent modified Warden surgery at our centre from September 2017 to September 2021. In all patients, the superior vena cava (SVC) was reconstructed by turning the atrial wall in the main body of the right atrium upwards and applying fresh autologous pericardial patches. There were 13 male patients and 13 female patients, and the median age of the patients was 7.0 (range, 0.3-47.0) years. The median follow-up time after surgery was 47.0 (range, 32.0-80.0) months.
RESULTS: The aortic cross-clamp time was 108.50±34.72 minutes, the cardiopulmonary bypass time was 154.81±41.65 minutes, the median postoperative mechanical ventilation time was 8.5 (range, 0.0-91.0) hours, the median intensive care unit stay was 43.5 (range, 15.0-352.0) hours, and the median length of postoperative hospital stay was 7.0 (range, 6.0-19.0) days. All patients were safely and successfully discharged from the hospital. No deaths or sinus node dysfunction occurred during the follow-up period. The mean gradient of the reconstructed SVC and/or the right pulmonary vein (PV) increased in eight patients and decreased to less than 1 mmHg in six patients. One (1) adult patient had already undergone two vascular interventions, and one child had persistent stenosis but did not undergo reoperation at the time of the study. In addition, two patients were subjected to pericardial windowing.
CONCLUSIONS: A modified Warden technique using a right atrial flap and autologous pericardium effectively corrected the high-plane connection between the PVs and SVC. This technique effectively avoids sinus node dysfunction; however, a short-term increase in the differential pressure of the re-established SVC or PV after the procedure is acceptable, and reintervention is required only in rare cases.
