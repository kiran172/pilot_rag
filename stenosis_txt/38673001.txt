Title: The Application of Precision Medicine in Structural Heart Diseases: A Step towards the Future.

Abstract: The personalized applications of 3D printing in interventional cardiology and cardiac surgery represent a transformative paradigm in the management of structural heart diseases. This review underscores the pivotal role of 3D printing in enhancing procedural precision, from preoperative planning to procedural simulation, particularly in valvular heart diseases, such as aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation. The ability to create patient-specific models contributes significantly to predicting and preventing complications like paravalvular leakage, ensuring optimal device selection, and improving outcomes. Additionally, 3D printing extends its impact beyond valvular diseases to tricuspid regurgitation and non-valvular structural heart conditions. The comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature presented here emphasizes the promising trajectory of individualized approaches facilitated by 3D printing, promising a future where tailored interventions based on precise anatomical considerations become standard practice in cardiovascular care.
