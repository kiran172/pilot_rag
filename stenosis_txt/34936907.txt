Title: The Relation Between Inter Arm Blood Pressure Difference and Presence of Cardiovascular Disease: A Review of Current Findings.

Abstract: Raised inter arm blood pressure difference (IABPD) is already well-known as a clinical sign of peripheral arterial diseases including aortic dissection and subclavian stenosis. However, there are several other diseases associated with high IABPD. Therefore, this study aimed to review the association between increased IABPD and the presence of lethal health conditions, the possible mechanisms behind this relationship, and its contributing risk factors. Significant IABPD has been observed in patients with atherosclerotic plaques, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. Patients with high IABPD are also at more risk of left ventricular hypertrophy that may affect long-term cardiac function. Besides, brain injuries such as stroke, dementia, and Alzheimer's disease has been related to increased IABPD. Considering that raised IABPD is associated with multiple cardiovascular diseases and other organ damage, IABPD detection may be accurate for the early diagnosis and screening of these life-threatening diseases and help manage them better.
