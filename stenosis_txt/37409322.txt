Title: A rare cause of esophageal stenosis: Compression due to a thoracic osteophyte.

Abstract: Several cases of esophageal stenosis caused by cervical vertebral osteophytes have been reported; however, few reports of esophageal stenosis caused by thoracic osteophytes are available. We describe the case of an 86-year-old man with esophageal stenosis caused by a thoracic osteophyte near the tracheal bifurcation. An endoscopic ultrasonography examination was scheduled to determine the cause of acute pancreatitis; however, lacerations observed at the bifurcation following endoscope removal during prior esophagogastroduodenoscopy led us to cancel the ultrasonography to avoid potential esophageal perforation. A review of the present case and six similar previous cases of thoracic osteophyte-associated esophageal stenosis (identified via a systematic search of the PubMed database) demonstrated the clinical importance of a thoracic osteophyte near physiological esophageal stenosis. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy and computed tomography should be performed to screen for vertebral osteophytes before endoscopic ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and transesophageal echocardiography to avoid iatrogenic accidents.
