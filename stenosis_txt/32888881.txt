Title: A rare case of infrarenal aortic coarctation in a young female.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Infrarenal abdominal aortic coarctation (AAC) is an extremely rare disease. It can be associated with renal artery stenosis determining secondary renal hypertension.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We report a case of AAC in young female patient presenting systemic hypertension non-responder to medical treatment. Diagnostics revealed the involvement of the right renal artery as the cause of hypertension. The management consisted of percutaneous renal artery stenting and close surveillance for the aortic segment. The treatment was uneventful with resolution of the hypertensive condition.
DISCUSSION: AAC etiology is unknown. There are no studies comparing the long-term treatment outcome in adult patients. The long-term prognosis depends mainly on blood pressure control and the underlying disease. In the reported case the treatment of the renal lesion was adequate to control the secondary hypertension. This approach does not preclude future intervention in the aortic segment and provides a fast-recovery and less invasive approach to the major clinical manifestation.
CONCLUSION: In this case the treatment of the specific vascular lesion was adequate to address the main clinical hypertensive manifestation. This less-invasive approach did not preclude future intervention in the aortic segment where the evolution of the disease is unknown.
