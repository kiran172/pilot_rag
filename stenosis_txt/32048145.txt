Title: Dilation of tracheal stenosis below tracheostomy tube with Dolphin percutaneous tracheostomy kit : Tracheal stenosis treated with Dolphin PDT.

Abstract: We reported a new minimally invasive procedure to treat tracheal stenosis below tracheostomy tube using standard Ciaglia Blue Dolphin kit for percutaneous tracheostomy. Under endoscopic view, the Dolphin kit was inserted through the stoma into the stenosis; the balloon was inflated until a sufficient tracheal diameter was obtained; then, a longer tracheostomy tube was inserted through the stenosis and the distal tip placed near the carina. This procedure was succesfully applied in seven patients.
