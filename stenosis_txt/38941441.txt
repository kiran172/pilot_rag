Title: An old but still valuable technique for popliteal artery stenosis: Endarterectomy via the posterior approach.

Abstract: Isolated popliteal artery occlusions are rare compared with femoropopliteal occlusive diseases. Although endovascular procedures have gained importance in treatment, conventional surgery remains the gold standard. In this study, we reviewed popliteal endarterectomy and patch plasty using a posterior approach. Fourteen patients who underwent surgery for isolated popliteal artery occlusions were retrospectively examined. Patients were assessed in terms of age, sex, and risk factors, such as accompanying diseases and smoking, surgical method and anesthesia, incision type, preoperative and postoperative pulse examination, ankle-brachial indices, patency, wound infection, postoperative complications, and the treatment applied. Twelve (85.7%) patients were male, and 2 (14.3%) were female. Limb ischemia was critical (ABI < 0.7) in 11 (78.5%) patients. The average duration of postoperative hospitalization was 8 ± 3.7 days on average, and the average length of follow-up was 17 ± 3.4 months. Thrombosis and complications requiring secondary intervention did not develop during the early postoperative period. While the patency rate in the first 6 months of follow-up was 100%, it was 92.8% in the 1st year and 85.7% in the 2nd year. Surgical treatment with the posterior approach in isolated popliteal artery lesions is preferred by vascular surgeons as a prioritized treatment method, with a sufficient recanalization rate and low perioperative morbidity and mortality rates. Furthermore, it is promising because it does not prevent below-knee femoropopliteal bypass, which is the subsequent stage of treatment. Moreover, the great saphenous vein was protected, and the acceptable early- and mid-term results were encouraging.
