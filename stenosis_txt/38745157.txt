Title: Serum levels of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 are associated with coronary atherosclerotic plaque progression in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lp-PLA2 is linked to cardiovascular diseases and poor outcomes, especially in diabetes, as it functions as a pro-inflammatory and oxidative mediator.
OBJECTIVES: This research aimed to explore if there is a connection between the serum levels of Lp-PLA2 and the progression of coronary plaques (PP) in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and those without the condition.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum Lp-PLA2 levels were measured in 137 T2DM patients with PP and 137 T2DM patients with no PP, and in 205 non-diabetic patients with PP and 205 non-diabetic patients with no PP. These individuals met the criteria for eligibility and underwent quantitative coronary angiography at the outset and again after about one year of follow-up. The attributes and parameters of the participants at the outset were recorded.
RESULTS: Increased serum levels of Lp-PLA2 were closely associated with coronary artery PP, and also significantly correlated with change of MLD, change of diameter stenosis and change of cumulative coronary obstruction in both diabetic and non-diabetic groups, with higher correlation coefficients in diabetic patients as compared with non-diabetic patients. Moreover, multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that serum Lp-PLA2 level was an independent determinant of PP in both groups, with OR values more significant in diabetic patients than in non-diabetic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Levels of serum Lp-PLA2 show a significant association with the progression of coronary atherosclerotic plaque in patients with T2DM and those without, especially among individuals with diabetes.
