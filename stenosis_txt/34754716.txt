Title: Wellens syndrome in a young woman with coronary artery vasculitis.

Abstract: We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who was referred to our hospital with chest pain. An electrocardiogram showed biphasic T-wave inversions in leads V2-4 compared with that done 2Â years ago, suggesting Wellens syndrome, and an emergent coronary angiography revealed significant stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending artery due to coronary artery vasculitis. Although acute coronary syndrome in the young is very rare, coronary artery vasculitis should be considered as a possible etiology, especially in young women with chest pain.
