Title: Successful Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in a Patient With Absent Right Coronary Artery Ostium: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Coronary artery anomalies present unique interventional challenges, particularly when associated with significant coronary artery disease. This case report contributes to the limited literature on congenital coronary artery anomalies, emphasizing the need for tailored approaches to optimize patient care. We present a case of a 70-year-old male with refractory angina and a rare congenital coronary anomaly characterized by the absence of the right coronary artery ostium, necessitating reliance on the left coronary system for myocardial perfusion. Cardiac catheterization revealed mid-left anterior descending artery stenosis, prompting percutaneous coronary intervention. Despite the anatomical complexities encountered, the procedure was successfully performed. This case underscores the importance of meticulous diagnostic evaluation, advanced imaging techniques, and a multidisciplinary approach to managing patients with rare coronary anomalies. This report also emphasizes the unique diagnostic and therapeutic considerations by providing a comprehensive literature review and identifying areas for further research to advance treatment strategies and improve outcomes.
