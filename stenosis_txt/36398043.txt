Title: Successful closure of the ventricular septal defect;A rare complication after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: In this report, we present a patient with ventricular septal defect (VSD) that was detected at follow-up one month after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and successfully closed percutaneously. Before the procedure, a 29 mm Portico self-expanding aortic valve prosthesis was placed in the heavy calcific aortic valve position, and then the balloon was dilated due to aortic insufficiency and excellent results were obtained. One month after TAVI, the patient complained of shortness of breath at rest, and on physical examination a pansystolic murmur was detected. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a well-functioning prosthetic aortic valve; however, a VSD was detected causing left-to-right shunt in the interventricular septum. Later, we performed the interventional treatment of the defect using the Amplatzer muscular VSD occluder device with the transfemoral approach. Currently, five months after the combined procedure, the patient showed a significant improvement in symptoms and no significant shunt was observed.
