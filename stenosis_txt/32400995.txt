Title: [Research Progress in Fractional Flow Reserve].

Abstract: Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is a heart disease caused by coronary artery stenosis or obstruction, resulting in myocardial ischemia, hypoxia or necrosis. Its examination methods include electrocardiogram, hematological examination, coronary CT, coronary angiography and intravascular imaging technology, etc. In recent years, blood Fractional Flow Reserve(FFR) has been widely used to measure the degree of coronary artery stenosis in the treatment of coronary heart disease. Based on the related literature at home and abroad, elaborated the FFR measurements of coronary artery stenosis degree background significance, basic principle and implementation method, on the basis of inductive expounds the FFR examination of clinical research and the advantages and disadvantages, at the same time a preliminary prospect on the development of technology of FFR iFR-the future instantaneous waveform ratio and the functional SYNTAX score has a broad space for development.
