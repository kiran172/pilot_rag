Title: Functional evaluation before and after laryngo-tracheal resection.

Abstract: Laryngotracheal resections have become a clinical routine in experienced airway centers and even extended glotto-subglottic resections and reconstructions can be performed with low complication rates and excellent long-term airway patency. However, reports on the functional outcome after laryngotracheal resections are sparse and there is no general agreement among airway surgeons, which functional evaluations should be performed before and after surgery. The following review provides an overview on basic assessment tools, which can be used to objectively report functional outcome after laryngotracheal surgery.
