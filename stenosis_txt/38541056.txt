Title: Hemidouble Stapling Technique versus Ghosting Double Stapling Technique for Esophagojejunostomy after Laparoscopic Total Gastrectomy.

Abstract: The hemidouble stapler technique (HDST) in laparoscopic intracorporeal esophagojejunostomy has aspects that pose risks to the safety of the anastomosis. We developed a new esophagojejunostomy technique that converts a double-stapled anastomosis to a single-stapled anastomosis in laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG). The aim of this study is to compare the results of two techniques. Patients who underwent LTG for gastric cancer in our hospital between October 2016 and May 2022 were included in the study. Patients were retrospectively reviewed in two groups: those who underwent HDST and the ghosting double stapling technique (GDST). Both groups were analysed in terms of demographics, perioperative findings, and postoperative outcomes. The GDST was used in 14 patients. The HDST was used on 16 patients. Two patients in the HDST group whose esophagojejunal anastomosis was not assessed on endoscopic imaging were excluded. The mean total operative times were 292.6 ± 43.7 and 224.3 ± 36.1 min (p &lt; 0.001). The mean times for esophagojejunostomy were 38.6 ± 4.3 and 26.8 ± 6.4 min (p &lt; 0.001). One case of anastomotic stenosis was observed in the HDST group. Anastomotic leakage was not observed in both groups. However, there was no significant difference in overall morbidity between the groups (p &gt; 0.05). Both HDST and GDST can be safely performed in the esophagojejunostomy for LTG.
