Title: Diagnostic Roots Radiofrequency Sensory Stimulation Looking for Symptomatic Injured Roots in Multiple Lumbar Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We present how to perform radiofrequency sensory stimulation (RFSS) and whether RFSS could be helpful in identifying symptomatic injured roots in multilevel lumbar stenosis.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent RFSS from 2010 to 2012 were enrolled. To identify pathologic lesions, RFSS was performed for suspicious roots, as determined using lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The RFSS procedure resembled transforaminal root block. During RFSS of the suspicious root, patients could indicate whether stimulation induced their usual pain and/or sensory changes and could indicate whether the same leg area was affected. The number of possible symptomatic roots on MRI was evaluated before and after RFSS. Based on the RFSS results, we confirmed the presence of symptomatic nerve root(s) and performed surgical decompression. Surgical results, such as numeric rating scale (NRS) scores for low back pain (LBP) and leg pain (LP), and Oswestry disability index (ODI), were evaluated.
RESULTS: Ten patients were enrolled in the study. Their mean age was 70.1±9.7 years. Clinically, NRS-LBP, NRS-LP, and ODI before surgery were 5.1%, 7.5%, and 53.2%, respectively. The mean number of suspicious roots was 2.6±0.8. After RFSS, the mean number of symptomatic roots was 1.6±1.0. On average, 1.4 lumbar segments were decompressed. The follow-up period was 35.3±12.8 months. At the last follow-up, NRS-LBP, NRS-LP, and ODI were 3.1%, 1.5%, and 35.3%, respectively. There was no recurrence or need for further surgical treatment for lumbar stenosis.
CONCLUSION: RFSS is a potentially helpful diagnostic tool for verifying and localizing symptomatic injured root lesions, particularly in patients with multilevel spinal stenosis.
