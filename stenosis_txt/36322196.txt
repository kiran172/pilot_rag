Title: [Treat calcified stenoses correctly].

Abstract: Due to the demographic changes with an increasing aging process of the population and the increasing incidence of comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, and chronic kidney disease, older patients with high-risk profiles and calcified coronary lesions are being treated more often in interventional cardiology. Despite advances in technical possibilities and materials, the treatment of severely calcified stenoses continues to be associated with an increased periprocedural risk of complications and poor long-term clinical outcomes. The purpose of this article is to discuss the various treatment approaches and summarize them in an algorithm for the treatment of severely calcified stenoses.
