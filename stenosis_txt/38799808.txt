Title: Invasive Assessment of Right Ventricular to Pulmonary Artery Coupling Improves 1-year Mortality Prediction After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Anticipates the Persistence of Extra-Aortic Valve Cardiac Damage.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The interplay between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, known as right ventricular to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling, is crucial for assessing right ventricular systolic function against the afterload from the pulmonary circulation. Pulmonary artery pressure levels are ideally measured by right heart catheterization. Yet, echocardiography represents the most utilized method for evaluating pulmonary artery pressure levels, albeit with limitations in accuracy. This study therefore aims to evaluate the prognostic significance of right ventricular to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) coupling expressed as tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) related to systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) levels measured by right heart catheterization (TAPSE/sPAP<sub>invasive</sub>) or estimated by transthoracic echocardiography (TAPSE/sPAP<sub>echocardiography</sub>) in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: Using data from a bicentric registry, this study compares TAPSE/sPAP<sub>invasive</sub> vs. TAPSE/sPAP<sub>echocardiography</sub> in predicting 1-year all-cause mortality after TAVR.
RESULTS: Among 333 patients with complete echocardiography and right heart catheterization data obtained before TAVR, their mean age was 79.8 ± 6.74 years, 39.6% were female, and general 1-year survival was 89.8%. sPAP<sub>invasive</sub> and sPAP<sub>echocardiography</sub> showed only moderate correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient R: 0.53, p value: &lt;0.0001). TAPSE/sPAP<sub>invasive</sub> was superior to TAPSE/sPAP<sub>echocardiography</sub> in predicting 1-year all-cause mortality after TAVR (area under the curve: 0.662 vs. 0.569, p value: 0.025). Patients with reduced TAPSE/sPAP<sub>invasive</sub> levels (&lt; 0.365 mm/mmHg) evidenced significantly lower 1-year survival rates than patients with preserved TAPSE/sPAP<sub>invasive</sub> levels (81.8 vs. 93.6%, p value: 0.001; hazard ratio for 1-year mortality: 3.09 [95% confidence interval: 1.55-6.17]). Echocardiographic follow-up data revealed that patients with reduced RV-PA coupling suffer from persistent right ventricular dysfunction (TAPSE: 16.6 ± 4.05 mm vs. 21.6 ± 4.81 mm in patients with preserved RV-PA coupling) and severe tricuspid regurgitation (diagnosed in 19.7 vs. 6.58% in patients with preserved RV-PA coupling).
CONCLUSIONS: RV-PA coupling expressed as TAPSE/sPAP<sub>invasive</sub> can refine stratification of severe aortic stenosis patients into low-risk and high-risk cohorts for mortality after TAVR. Moreover, it can help to anticipate persistent extra-aortic valve cardiac damage, which will demand further treatment.
