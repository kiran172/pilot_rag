Title: [A single-center retrospective analysis of 77 traumatic arterial injuries of lower extremities].

Abstract: Objective: To analyze the treatment and clinical prognosis of lower extremity arterial injury caused by trauma. Methods: The clinical data of 77 patients with traumatic lower extremity arterial injury admitted to Department of Vascular Surgery,Yichang Central People's Hospital from January 2013 to June 2021 were collected retrospectively. There were 65 males and 12 females, with an average age of 47.4 years (range: 7 to 75 years). Among the 77 patients, 56 cases (72.7%) had open injury and 21 cases (27.3%) had closed injury. Iliac artery was injured in 9 cases (11.7%), common femoral artery in 7 cases (9.1%), superficial femoral artery in 1 case (1.3%), popliteal artery in 11 cases (14.3%) and inferior knee artery in 49 cases (63.6%). The treatment methods and clinical effects were analyzed. Results: One case with pelvic fracture combined the internal iliac artery injury and 1 case with multiple injuries involving the common femoral artery died of circulatory failure before surgery. Seventy-five cases received vascular-related operations, including arterial ligation in 24 cases, arterial reconstruction in 40 cases, stent graft implantation in 1 case, primary amputation in 2 cases, and arterial embolization in 8 cases. The overall mortality rate was 6.5% (5/77), all of which were closed injuries. Except for 2 cases who died before surgery, 3 cases with pelvic fracture combined the internal iliac artery injury died of multiple organ failure after internal iliac artery embolization. There were 8 cases received amputation (10.4%, 8/77), 5 cases with closed injury and 3 cases with open injury. In addition to 2 cases with primary amputation, 6 cases underwent secondary amputation due to ischemia-reperfusion injury after revascularization (4 cases with popliteal artery injury and 2 cases with subpatellar artery injury). The average followed-up time was 17 months (range: 2 months to 8 years). One patient with femoral artery injury underwent autologous great saphenous vein bypass, and lower limb artery CT angiography was re-examined 6 months after the operation, and 30% distal anastomotic stenosis was found. Ankle brachial index&lt;0.8 was found in two patients 1 year after popliteal artery repair, but none of the patients had intermittent claudication symptoms, and no further intervention was performed. Five patients suffered delayed healing due to severe lower limb injury, fracture and skin injury. Among them, 2 cases had poor wound healing at the stump of amputation, which gradually healed 3 to 5 months after several debridements. The other 3 vascular injury combined with tibial fracture patients had delayed tibial healing after surgery, but no symptoms of vascular ischemia occurred. All the other patients recovered well and no other serious complications occurred. Conclusions: The proportion of death and disability in patients with lower limb artery injury caused by trauma is high. Active and orderly surgical repair according to the site and type of injury can reduce the mortality, save the function of the affected limb, and promote the healing of injury.
