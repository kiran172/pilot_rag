Title: A case report of intestinal obstruction caused by cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cryptogenic multifocal ulcer stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) is a rare disease characterized by multiple superficial ulcers, stenosis, and obstruction of the small intestine of unknown origin, and the course can recur.
CASE PRESENTATION: We encountered a 62-year-old male patient with intestinal obstruction. The patient was admitted to the hospital for surgical treatment due to intestinal obstruction, and was diagnosed with cryptogenic multifocal ulcer stenosis enteritis due to comprehensive surgery and postoperative pathological considerations.
CONCLUSION: In the future, we will continue to follow up the patient. The present study aims to remind clinicians of this disease, and reduce the incidence of misdiagnosis.
