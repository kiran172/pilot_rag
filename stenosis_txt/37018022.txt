Title: Finite element analysis of braided dense-mesh stents for carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: When braided dense-mesh stents are used to treat carotid stenosis, the structural mechanics of vascular stents, the contact mechanics with blood vessels, and the fluid mechanics in the blood environment need to be studied in depth to reduce the damage of stents to blood vessels and the incidence of in-stent restenosis. Three types of braided stents with 8, 16, and 24 strands and laser-cut stents with the corresponding size parameters were designed, and the bending behavior of each of these types of stent, deployment, and fluid dynamic analysis of the 24-strand braided stent were simulated. The results show that the bending stress of the 8-, 16-, and 24-strand braided stents is 46.33%, 50.24%, and 31.86% of that of their laser-cut counterparts. In addition, higher strand density of the braided stents was associated with greater bending stress; after the 24-strand braided stent was expanded within the stented carotid artery, the carotid stenosis rate was reduced from 81.52% to 46.33%. After stent implantation, the maximum stress on the vessel wall in a zero-pressure diastolic environment decreased from 0.34 to 0.20 MPa, the maximum pressure on the intravascular wall surface decreased from 4.89 to 3.98 kPa, the area of high-pressure region decreased, the wall shear force of the stenotic segment throat decreased, and blood flow increased in the stenosis segments. The braided stent had less bending stress and better flexibility than the laser-cut stent under the same stent size parameters; after the 24-strand braided stent was implanted into the stented vessel, it could effectively dilate the vessel, and the blood flow status was improved.
