Title: Traditional Atriopulmonary Connection Fontan with Excellent Outcome for 32 Years.

Abstract: Although the traditional right atrial-pulmonary artery (RA-PA) Fontan has been replaced by the total cavopulmonary connection, some RA-PA Fontan patients still have good outcome. We report a 37-year-old male who underwent traditional Fontan 32 years ago with the diagnosis of L-transposition of great arteries, subvalvular pulmonary stenosis and cardiac dextroversion. Among the recent CTA, electroconvulsive therapy, catheterization and angiography, pulsatile PA, uniform pulmonary blood, normal PA pressure and resistance were observed in this patient. The traditional RA-PA Fontan may be an alternative surgical procedure.
