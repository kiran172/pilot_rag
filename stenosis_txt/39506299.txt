Title: Mid-Term Results of Pulmonary Valve-Sparing Repair for Tetralogy of Fallot With Pulmonary Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The transannular patch remains the most common procedure performed for patients with Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with pulmonary stenosis. Pulmonary regurgitation has a negative impact on early and late outcomes. To address this issue pulmonary valve-sparing repair (PVSR) has been developed. Our study goal is to evaluate the mid-term outcomes (five years) of PVSR at our institution.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data were collected retrospectively from June 2014 to June 2022. A total of 390 patients had total repair of TOF. Among these, PVSR was performed in 154 (39.4%) patients. The mid-term outcomes on the status of the pulmonary valve gradient, degree of pulmonary regurgitation, reintervention rate, and mid-term survival after PVSR were investigated.
RESULTS: The median age at time of TOF repair was 12 (interquartile range [IQR]: 8-48) months and the median weight was 7.9 (IQR: 3.1-49.5) kg. The mean preoperative right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) gradient was 77 ± 19.6 mm Hg. All patients had a pulmonary valve Z score of more than -2.5. The post-repair mean RV/LV pressure ratio was 0.49 ± 0.12. There was no surgical mortality. The median follow-up was 3 years (6 months to 8 years). The reintervention rate on the pulmonary valve was 4/154 (2.6%) at five years. The freedom from reintervention and from developing moderate pulmonary valve regurgitation at 5 years was 95% (151/154) and 77% (119/154), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Pulmonary valve-sparing repair gives good mid-term outcomes in a specific group of patients with TOF. Reintervention rates are very low and the peak gradient across the pulmonary valve came down in the majority of patients during mid-term follow up. An RVOT gradient more than 40mm Hg at discharge predicts a high risk of need for reintervention. We continue to monitor our patients for the long term outcome.
