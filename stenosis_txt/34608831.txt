Title: Technical aspects and operative nuances using a high-definition 4K-3-dimensional exoscope for carotid endarterectomy surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is effective in treating carotid artery stenosis to prevent stroke. Historically, this operation has been performed utilizing loupe magnification with or without the operating microscope (OM). However, there remains a need for continued improvement in operative visualization and surgical ergonomics. Recently, newly developed digital 'exoscope' has provided the surgeon with unique lighting and magnification as well as improvements in surgical ergonomics and working angle. We sought to review our cumulative experience using a novel 4K high-definition (4K-HD) 3-dimensional (3D) exoscope (EX) for CEA surgery.
METHODS: All CEA surgery cases at our institution between 2013 and 2019 using the 4K-HD 3D EX were reviewed. Operative parameters, patient outcome and operator's assessment of the EX compared to OM-assisted cases was conducted.
RESULTS: 28 patients were treated, 10 of which were operated using the EX. All procedures were performed without perioperative complications, or significant differences in operative parameters (blood loss &lt;20 cm3 and 164 ± 49.5 minutes) compared to OM-assisted cases. Operators reported improved level of comfort performing 'high' bifurcation surgery and improved visualization and posture during inspection of the distal ICA lumen as primary advantages of EX-assisted CEA over OM-assisted CEA.
CONCLUSIONS: The ORBEYE EX, albeit a learning curve necessitating a short period of the OR team, provided safety and outcome comparable to OM-assisted surgery. Potential advantages noted were improved visualization and ergonomics specifically for when extreme working angles were required. Our experience suggests that the exoscope may become a valuable alternative to standard magnification tools in CEA surgery.
