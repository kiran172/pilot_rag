Title: Popliteal Vein Entrapment as a Rare Form of Popliteal Entrapment Syndrome.

Abstract: Popliteal entrapment syndrome (PES) describes a cluster of symptoms related to the compression of the neurovascular bundle in the popliteal fossa, most commonly involving the popliteal artery. In approximately 10-15% of the cases of popliteal entrapment syndrome, the popliteal vein is compressed. Symptoms of popliteal vein entrapment can mimic venous insufficiency or deep venous thrombosis, causing the diagnosis to be missed or delayed. Diagnosis of popliteal vein entrapment can be done with duplex imaging with flexion and extension maneuvers; however, venography is the gold standard for diagnosis. While popliteal vein entrapment is commonly associated with younger individuals, it may also be an underdiagnosed condition in older patients. We describe two cases of successful diagnosis and treatment of late-onset presentation of popliteal vein entrapment.
