Title: Two window-minimally invasive lumbar spine surgery (new approach) has a better post operative outcome and less soft tissue damage.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this new approach is to develop a method that is less invasive as well as less traumatic and can provide a better exposure/view of the surgical field. Postoperatively, the patient has less pain, short hospital stay and less use of the postoperative pain control medications. As compared to other minimally invasive spine surgeries this approach results in less soft tissue damage, minimal muscle destruction, less retraction and better surgical outcome.
METHODS: In this article authors focus on the new approach that has cost effective benefits as well as short recovery time postoperatively.
RESULTS: Approach is applicable for severe spinal stenosis as compared to other Minimally Invasive Spine Surgery (MISS) techniques that are only applicable for the mild to moderate stenosis or degenerative processes. This plane is avascular plane so no or less bleeding is anticipated from this procedure.
CONCLUSION: The technique facilitates bilateral canal enlargement through unilateral approach and provides accessibility to the contralateral foramen for decompression with perfect exposure and allows instrumentation through the lateral window with no muscle destruction.
