Title: Platelet miR-587 may be Used as a Potential Biomarker for Diagnosis of Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The current study aims to investigate the expression of miR-587 in platelets of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and its correlation with the severity of coronary artery disease.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-nine patients with ACS who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) and hospitalized in the Department of Cardiology of Affiliated Tengzhou Central People's Hospital of Jining Medical University were selected. In addition, 42 subjects with normal CAG results were selected as the control group. The relative expression of platelet miR-587 was analyzed between ACS patients and control subjects.
RESULTS: The relative expression of platelet miR-587 and Gensini score in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients were significantly higher than those in the unstable angina pectoris (UA) and control groups (median (IQR): 1.97 (0.47) vs. 1.49 (0.43) vs. 1.04 (0.35); 65.07 (21.6) vs. 44.58 (28.56) vs. 13.67 (11.8)). Furthermore, the relative level of miR-587 in ACS patients with three vessel lesions was significantly higher than those with double vessel le-sion and single vessel lesion (2.68 (0.64) vs. 1.85 (0.53) vs. 1.22 (0.40)). Additionally, the relative expression of platelet miR-587 in patients with severe coronary artery disease was significantly higher than in those with moderate or mild coronary artery disease (2.44 (0.59) vs. 1.70 (0.49) vs. 0.96 (0.32)). Pearson's correlation analysis showed that the Gensini score and creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) of ACS patients were positively correlated with the expression of platelet miR-587 (r = 0.785, p = 0.000; r = 0.806, p = 0.000).
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of platelet miR-587 was closely related to the severity of coronary artery stenosis and could be used as a potential target for diagnosis or prognosis.
