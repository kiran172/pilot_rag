Title: Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis: The Update and Future Directions from Interventional Perspective.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS) is a condition where the renal arteries become narrowed due to atherosclerosis, leading to reduced blood flow to the kidneys and various renal complications. The effectiveness of interventional treatments, such as renal artery angioplasty and stenting, remains debated, making patient selection for these procedures challenging.
SUMMARY: This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of ARAS, with a particular emphasis on the potential role of functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in evaluating renal function and mechanisms. By summarizing current diagnostic approaches and outcomes of interventional treatments, the review highlights the importance of informed clinical decision-making in ARAS management. Functional MRI emerges as a promising noninvasive tool to assess renal function, aiding in patient stratification and treatment planning.
KEY MESSAGES: The efficacy of interventional treatments for ARAS requires further investigation and careful patient selection. Functional MRI holds promise as a noninvasive means to assess renal function and mechanisms, potentially guiding more effective clinical decisions in ARAS management. Advancing research in diagnostic methods, particularly functional MRI, can enhance our understanding and improve the treatment outcomes for ARAS patients.
