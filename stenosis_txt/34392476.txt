Title: Obstruction after Sleeve Gastrectomy, Prevalence, and Interventions: a Cohort Study of 9,726 Patients with Data from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is the most common bariatric procedure worldwide. Obstructive symptoms, together with leaks, are among the most serious postoperative complications. This study aimed to investigate the incidence of symptomatic obstruction after SG in Sweden and to explore risk factors, treatment strategies, and outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from the Scandinavian Obesity Surgery Registry (SOReg) of patients undergoing SG and developed obstruction symptoms within the first postoperative year was performed. For patients who had undergone any re-intervention, such as endoscopic dilatation or remedial surgery, medical charts were reviewed.
RESULTS: From 2007 to 2018, a total of 9,726 SG were performed, and 59 (0.6%) of them developed postoperative obstruction. Intolerance of solid food was the most common symptom associated with obstruction (80%). Sixty-one percent of the patients had obstruction at the level of incisura angularis. Longer operative time, higher rate of perioperative complications, longer hospital stay, and oversewing the staple line were associated with an increased risk of obstruction. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was performed in 59% of patients (n=35) and successful in 18 patients (51%). Twenty-one patients (36%) underwent surgical conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). After revisional surgery, 11 (52%) reported complete relief of symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Obstruction was rare (0.6%) and most often located at the incisura angularis. Obstruction was associated with longer operative time, perioperative complications, oversewing of the staple line, and longer hospital stay. Endoscopic dilatation or surgical conversion to RYGB frequently alleviates symptoms, but despite treatment, almost 50% reported residual symptoms.
