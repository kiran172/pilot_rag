Title: Safety of Triple Neuroprotection with Targeted Hypothermia, Controlled Induced Hypertension, and Barbiturate Infusion during Emergency Carotid Endarterectomy for Acute Stroke after Missing the 24 Hours Window Opportunity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study is to establish the initial safety of triple neuroprotection (TNP) in an acute stroke setting in patients presenting outside the window for systemic tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).
METHODS: Over 12,000 patients were referred to our vascular services with carotid artery disease, of whom 832 had carotid intervention with a stroke rate of 0.72%. Of these, 25 patients presented (3%), between March 2015 and 2019, with acute dense stroke. These patients had either failed tPA or passed the recommended timing for acute stroke intervention. Fifteen (60%) had hemi-neglect with evidence of acute infarct on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a Rankin score of 4 or 5. Ninety-six percent had an 80-99% stenosis on the symptomatic side. Mean ABCD3-I score was 11.35. All patients underwent emergency carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with therapeutically induced hypothermia (32-34°C), targeted hypertension (systolic blood pressure 180-200 mm Hg), and brain suppression with barbiturate.
RESULTS: There were no cases of myocardial infarction, death, cranial nerve injury, wound hematoma, or procedural bleeding. Mean hospital stay was 8.4 (±9.5) days. All cases had resolution of neurological symptoms, except 3 who had failed previous thrombolysis. Eighty percent had a postoperative Rankin score of 0 on discharge and 88% of patients were discharged home with 3 requiring rehabilitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Positive neurological outcomes and no serious adverse events were observed using TNP during emergency CEA in patients with acute brain injury. We recommend TNP for patients who are at an increased risk of stroke perioperatively, or who have already suffered from an acute stroke beyond the recommended window of 24 hr. Certainly, the positive outcomes are not likely reproducible outside of high-volume units and patients requiring this surgery should be transferred to experienced surgeons in appropriate tertiary referral centers.
