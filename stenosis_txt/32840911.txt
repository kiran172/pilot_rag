Title: Supravalvular mitral remnant: The other side of the… valve.

Abstract: We report a challenging clinical case of an atypical supravalvular mitral remnant in recent mitral and aortic valve replacement with mechanical valve prostheses, associated with postoperative recurrent inflammatory episodes overlapped with difficult anticoagulation. Negative myocardial scintigraphy was associated with persistence of negative blood cultures. Serial echocardiographic evaluation was performed before and after antimicrobial treatment, and at 3 months follow-up a transesophageal echocardiography showed the persistence of the mass. Diagnostic suspect was finally confirmed.
