Title: Application value of magnetic resonance hydrography of the inner ear in cochlear implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the application value of magnetic resonance (MR) hydrography of the inner ear in cochlear implantation.
METHODS: 146 patients were enrolled. MR hydrography and spiral CT examinations for the intracranial auditory canal were performed before surgery, and all imaging results were statistically analyzed in order to explore the application value of MR hydrography of the inner ear in cochlear implantation.
RESULTS: 146 patients (292 ears) were examined. Among these patients, 13 were diagnosed with abnormal vestibular aqueducts (20 ears) by MR hydrography, while five were diagnosed with this disease by CT; 15 patients were diagnosed with inner ear malformation (19 ears) by MR hydrography, while 11 were diagnosed by CT (four were misdiagnosed); five patients were diagnosed with internal acoustic canal stenosis (eight ears) by MR hydrography, while two were diagnosed by CT (three were misdiagnosed); and four patients were diagnosed with cochlear fibrosis (five ears) by MR hydrography, while four were diagnosed by CT (four ears). The correct rate of diagnosis was 77.40% (113/146) based on CT, while the rate was 93.84% (137/146) based on MR hydrography.
CONCLUSIONS: MR hydrography imaging technique can be applied to the preoperative evaluation of cochlear implantation, providing accurate and reliable anatomic information on the inner membranous labyrinth and nerves in the internal acoustic canal and an accurate basis for the diagnosis of cochlear fibrosis and nerve development. This has a guiding significance for the selection of treatment schemes.
