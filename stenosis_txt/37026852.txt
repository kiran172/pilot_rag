Title: The bleeding risk and safety of multiple treatments by bronchoscopy in patients with central airway stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Central airway obstruction (CAO) are common abnormality that usually needing interventional bronchoscopy, and sometimes multiple rounds of treatment. However, there were few studies explore the safety of it.
RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODS: The records of patients who underwent interventional bronchoscopy because of CAO at Respiratory department between 1 January 2010, and 31 December 2020 were revised. The patients' clinical characteristics, information about bronchoscopy and incidence of complications were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: There were totally 1,482 bronchoscopy procedures conducted in the 733 CAO patients. And the incidence of major complications in the retreatment group was significantly lower than that in the first treatment group ((4.77% vs. 1.87%, χ2 = 9.78, df = 1, p &lt; 0.01), so did the incidence of severe bleeding (2.46% vs. 0.40%, χ2 = 11.20, df = 1, p &lt; 0.01). However, there was some variability between the two groups in age and anesthesia type. A short interval time, more treatment times, and general anesthesia were related to a lower incidence of hemorrhage. For patients who were previously bleeding, the incidence of hemorrhage was significantly higher than the incidence in the non-bleeding patients (42.93% vs. 16.33%, respectively; χ2 = 57.54, df = 1, p &lt; 0.01).
CONCLUSION: For the patients with CAO, repeated interventional bronchoscopy treatment was safe, and it should be treated with discretion when retreat the patients once bleeding during previous therapeutic bronchoscopy.
