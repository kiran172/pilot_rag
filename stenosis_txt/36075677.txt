Title: Impact of Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction on Clinical Outcomes in Bicuspid Aortic Valve Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The prognostic impact of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease has not been previously studied.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine the prognostic impact of LVEF in BAV patients according to the type of aortic valve dysfunction.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the data collected in 2,672 patients included in an international registry of patients with BAV. Patients were classified according to the type of aortic valve dysfunction: isolated aortic stenosis (AS) (n = 749), isolated aortic regurgitation (AR) (n = 554), mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) (n = 190), or no significant aortic valve dysfunction (n = 1,179; excluded from this analysis). The study population was divided according to LVEF strata to investigate its impact on clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: The risk of all-cause mortality and the composite endpoint of aortic valve replacement or repair (AVR) and all-cause mortality increased when LVEF was <60% in the whole cohort as well as in the AS and AR groups, and when LVEF was <55% in MAVD group. In multivariable analysis, LVEF strata were significantly associated with increased rate of mortality (LVEF 50%-59%: HR: 1.83 [95% CI: 1.09-3.07]; P = 0.022; LVEF 30%-49%: HR: 1.97 [95% CI: 1.13-3.41]; P = 0.016; LVEF <30%: HR: 4.20 [95% CI: 2.01-8.75]; P < 0.001; vs LVEF 60%-70%, reference group).
CONCLUSIONS: In BAV patients, the risk of adverse clinical outcomes increases significantly when the LVEF is <60%. These findings suggest that LVEF cutoff values proposed in the guidelines to indicate intervention should be raised from 50% to 60% in AS or AR and 55% in MAVD.
