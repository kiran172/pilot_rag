Title: Symptom Outcomes After Sialendoscopy-Assisted Salivary Duct Surgery: A Prospective 6-Year Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective is to evaluate the long-term impact of sialendoscopic-assisted salivary duct surgery (SASDS) on sialadenitis symptoms using the Chronic Obstructive Sialadenitis Symptoms (COSS) questionnaire.
METHODS: The COSS questionnaire, which scores symptoms on a 0-100 scale, was administered prospectively to adult patients pre-operatively, 1-year, and 6-years post-operatively. We examined COSS scores and categories representing complete (<10), partial (10-25), and no (>25) resolution of symptoms with attention to factors significantly associated with incomplete resolution (≥10).
RESULTS: Approximately 6-years after SASDS, 111 patients reported scores for 128 symptomatic glands (72 with sialolithiasis, 56 without sialolithiasis). For glands with sialolithiasis, the median COSS score pre-SASDS was 27.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 13.5-43), which was significantly reduced to 1.0 (IQR: 0-5.5) at 1-year and 1.5 (IQR 0-5) at 6-years postoperatively. Glands without sialolithiasis had a median COSS score of 40.5 (IQR: 23-52.5) preoperatively, that significantly reduced to 13.5 (IQR 5-21) at 1-year and 14 (IQR 6.5-25.5) at 6-years post-operatively. There was no significant difference in scores from 1- to 6-years. Intraoperative presence of sialolith, absence of stenosis, stenosis in the distal duct, and submandibular gland involvement were significant predictors of complete resolution of symptoms at 6-years.
CONCLUSION: Approximately 6-years after SASDS for sialadenitis, the majority of patients have durable symptom improvement. The sialolithiasis group had higher rates of complete resolution compared to the non-sialolithiasis group. Presence of ductal stenosis on sialendoscopy, non-distal stenoses, and parotid gland involvement were risk factors for persistent long-term sialadenitis symptoms. Laryngoscope, 133:792-800, 2023.
