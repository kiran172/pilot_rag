Title: Post-Transplant Biliary Strictures: An Updated Review.

Abstract: Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative therapy in patients with end-stage liver disease with excellent long-term survival; however, LT recipients are at risk of significant complications. Among these complications are biliary complications with an incidence ranging from 5 to 32% and associated with significant post-LT morbidity and mortality. Prompt recognition and management are critical as these complications have been associated with mortality rates up to 19% and retransplantation rates up to 13%. An important limitation of published studies is that a large proportion does not discriminate between anastomotic strictures and nonanastomotic strictures. This review aims to summarize our current understanding of risk factors and natural history, diagnostic testing, and treatment options for post-LT biliary strictures.
