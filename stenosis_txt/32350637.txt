Title: On-site assessment of computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve in comparison with myocardial perfusion imaging and invasive fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography has been established as a standard noninvasive tool for risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). We evaluated the diagnostic performance of on-site workstation-based computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) in comparison with MPI using invasive fractional flow reserve (invasive FFR) as a gold standard. We enrolled 97 patients with suspected CAD. Diagnostic performance of CT angiography (CTA), and CT-FFR was compared in 105 lesions of 97 patients. Invasive FFR ≤ 0.8 was detected in 38 (36%) lesions. Diagnostic performance of CT-FFR was improved compared with CTA (AUC 0.83 vs. 0.60, p < 0.0001). The lesions with both CTA and MPI findings (n = 47), invasive FFR ≤ 0.8 was detected in 19 (40.4) lesions. CT-FFR (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.72-0.94) significantly improved diagnostic performance compared with CTA-50% (AUC 0.59, p = 0.00019) and MPI (AUC 0.64, p = 0.0082). In lesions with ≥ 50% on CTA (n = 42), diagnostic accuracy of CT-FFR (AUC 0.81) was significantly superior to MPI (AUC 0.64, p = 0.0239). In conclusions, CT-FFR improved diagnostic accuracy to detect invasive FFR ≤ 0.8 compared with luminal stenosis on CTA and ischemia on MPI. Patients with ≥ 50% stenosis on CTA would be the candidates for CT-FFR.
