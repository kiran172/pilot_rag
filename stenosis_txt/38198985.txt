Title: Hybrid technique has lower stricture rates than Wallace and Bricker.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: A clear consensus has not yet been reached on the optimal ureteroenteric anastomosis technique for ileal conduit urinary diversion following radical cystectomy. This study aims to determine the incidence of strictures and their management associated with these anastomosis techniques.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of patients who underwent radical cystectomy and urinary diversion between March 2014 and August 2022. Patients were categorized based on the ureteroenteric anastomosis technique used: Wallace, Bricker, or Hybrid. Strictures were identified through antegrade pyelography following nephrostomy placement.
RESULTS: A total of 141 patients were included in the study, with 60 patients in the Wallace group (42 %), 42 patients in the Bricker group (30 %), and 39 patients in the Hybrid group (28 %). The overall incidence of ureteroenteric strictures was 15 %, with 7 patients in the Wallace group, 11 patients in the Bricker group, and 3 patients in the Hybrid group experiencing strictures. There was no statistically significant difference in stricture rates between the Wallace and Bricker groups (11 % vs. 26 %, p = 0.09) or between the Wallace and Hybrid groups (11 % vs. 7 %, p = 0.73). However, a statistically significant difference was observed between the Bricker and Hybrid groups (26 % vs. 7 %, p = 0.03). The mean time to stricture development was 9.2 ± 3.3 months for the Wallace group, 9.5 ± 3.7 months for the Bricker group, and 12.6 ± 5 months for the Hybrid group (p = 0.407).
CONCLUSION: The Hybrid ureteroenteric anastomosis technique exhibits a lower stricture rate compared to the Bricker and Wallace techniques. It represents a safe and feasible alternative technique.
