Title: [Analysis of the necessity of anticoagulation therapy and influencing factors of stent occlusion after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the necessity of anticoagulation therapy and influencing factors of stent occlusion after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. Methods: The basic information, laboratory test results, preoperative portal venous pressure, postoperative anticoagulation time, postoperative stent stenosis or occlusion, followed-up and other data of all patients who underwent TIPS surgery in Shandong Provincial Hospital from 2010 to 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Data were analyzed using t-test, Ï‡2 test, and multivariate analysis (logistic regression and Cox-regression-analysis). Results: A total of 280 cases were finally included in the study, of which 110 (39.3%) had stent stenosis or occlusion, and 170 (60.7%) had stent patency. New or worsening ascites were identified in 194 cases during the follow-up period, including 14 (31.1%) cases in the stent stenosis or occlusion group and 19 (12.8%) cases in the stent patency group. Univariate analysis showed that presence or absence of platelet (P=0.037) and total bilirubin (P=0.038) were correlated with stent stenosis or occlusion. Postoperative continuous anticoagulation was correlated with stent blockage (P=0.029) in patients with partial portal vein thrombosis. Postoperative continuous anticoagulation and stent occlusions were not significantly correlated in patients with preoperative portal cavernoma and preoperative portal vein patency (P=0.848; P=0.744). Multivariate analysis results showed that whether long-term anticoagulation (P=0.017), all-cause rebleeding (P&lt;0.001), postoperative significant hepatic encephalopathy (P&lt;0.012), and postoperative new or worsening ascites (P&lt;0.001) was significantly associated with stent occlusion (P&lt;0.05), while platelets (P=0.134), total bilirubin (P=0.229), international normalized ratio (P=0.436), and portal vein pressure (P=0.230) were not significantly associated with stent occlusion after surgery. Conclusion: In patients with partial portal vein thrombosis before surgery, continuous anticoagulation for 30 days post-TIPS therapy can effectively prevent stent stenosis or occlusion; while in patients with portal vein patency, portal cavernoma and complete portal vein blockage before surgery, postoperative anticoagulation has no significant effect on stent stenosis or occlusion.
