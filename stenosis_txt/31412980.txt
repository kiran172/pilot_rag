Title: A Review of Middle Aortic Syndromes in Pediatric Patients.

Abstract: Middle aortic syndrome (MAS) is a rare vascular disease occurring in pediatric patients. MAS describes narrowing of the abdominal aorta, often referred to as abdominal coarctation. Extra-aortic vessels are commonly involved, including the renal and mesenteric arteries. Pediatric patients with MAS frequently present with severe hypertension, and medical management often is insufficient. Many of these patients require endovascular or open surgical intervention. This review article discusses the etiology, symptoms, and management of pediatric MAS. It highlights the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative anesthetic management of these patients. It is important that anesthesiologists be aware of this rare disease and its special anesthetic considerations when caring for children with MAS because of its high morbidity.
