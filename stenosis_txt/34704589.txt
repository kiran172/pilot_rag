Title: First Malian series of surgery for rheumatic valve disease: opening of the centre, clinical features and peri-operative realities.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Over the past two decades, the incidence of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and chronic rheumatic heart disease (RHD) have dramatically declined in wealthier regions of the world as a result of preventative programmes, improved living standards and access to cardiac surgery. Nevertheless, ARF and RHD are still public health problems in less-developed regions of the world such as Oceania, south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
AIM: We report on clinical, therapeutic and prognostic aspects as well as the difficulties encountered during this first series of surgery for rheumatic valve disease in Mali.
METHODS: This was a prospective, descriptive study conducted at the Andre Festoc Cardiac Surgery Centre from September 2018 to August 2019.
RESULTS: The frequency of patients having been operated on for rheumatic valve disease was 44.73% (68 patients). The mean age of the patients was 18 Â± 10 years with extremes of five and 60 years. The gender ratio was 0.7. The delay to treatment was between one and three years for 39.7% of the patients. The main diagnoses found were: mitral regurgitation in 50% of patients, mitral stenosis in 16.2% and aortic regurgitation in 10.3%. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 35-50 mmHg in 19.1% of patients and more than 50 mmHg in 25%. The median cardiopulmonary bypass time was 132 minutes (60-276) and median extubation time was three hours (0-96). The main complications were cardiac, renal, neurological, respiratory, gastrointestinal and infectious. In the immediate postoperative period, we recorded three deaths, which is a mortality rate of 4.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Humanitarian efforts have led non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to launch surgical programmes in low-and middle-income countries in an attempt to fill the gap in these fragile healthcare systems. Cardiac surgery requires much expertise from the medical staff, as well as many material and financial resources. Empowerment of the local team is a challenge that is being realised since taking these essential steps of companionship with the NGO la Chaine de l'Espoir.
