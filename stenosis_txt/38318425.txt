Title: A case of repeated Kounis syndrome after anaphylactic shock: A note for disease management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Kounis syndrome (KS) is an underdiagnosed disease. The management of the disease remains elusive because of its infrequency.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old man with anaphylactic shock was admitted to our hospital 2â€‰h after multiple bee stings. After recovering from an anaphylactic reaction, he presented with chest pain with ST elevation. We diagnosed him with KS. After a continuous intravenous infusion of vasodilators, his chest pain and ST elevation improved. However, chest pain with ST-segment elevation recurred the next day. Coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis in the middle left anterior descending coronary artery, and drug-eluting stents were implanted. The patient was discharged on foot after treatment for heart failure.
CONCLUSION: KS, in which anaphylaxis and acute coronary syndrome occur simultaneously, can recur repeatedly after an initial anaphylactic reaction; however, it could be delayed or it could present simultaneously with the anaphylactic reaction. Therefore, long-term observation is important.
