Title: "Under the Bridge": Looking for Ischemia in a Patient with Intramyocardial Coronary Artery Course-The Role of the Cardiopulmonary Exercise Test.

Abstract: Many variables obtained during cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), including O<sub>2</sub> uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>) versus heart rate (HR, O<sub>2</sub>-pulse) and work rate (VO<sub>2</sub>/Watt), provide quantitative patterns of responses to exercise when left ventricular dysfunction is an effect of myocardial ischemia (MI). Therefore, CPET offers a unique approach to evaluate exercise-induced MI in the presence of fixed or dynamic coronary arteries stenosis. In this paper, we examined the case of a 74-year-old patient presenting with an ischemic CPET and a normal stress cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) with dipyridamole. A coronary angiography demonstrated the presence of myocardial bridging (MB), a well-known congenital coronary anomaly that is able to generate MI during exercise (but not in provocative testing using coronary artery vasodilators, such as dipyridamole). Despite the good diagnostic accuracy of the imaging methods (i.e., stress CMR) in MI detection, this case shows that exercise should be the method of choice in elicit ischemia in specific cases, like MB.
