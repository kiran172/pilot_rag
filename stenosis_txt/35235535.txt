Title: Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Pure Aortic Regurgitation With Extremely Horizontal Aorta: A Case Series.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is not the preferred therapy for pure aortic regurgitation (AR). Extremely horizontal aorta (aorta root angle ≥70°) is regarded as an "off-label" use in self-expanding TAVR. This case series enrolled 7 consecutive pure AR patients who had extremely horizontal aorta and underwent self-expanding TAVR from the TORCH registry. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report successful self-expanding TAVR for pure AR with extremely horizontal aorta, revealing the feasibility of both transapical and transfemoral TAVR in this challenging population.
