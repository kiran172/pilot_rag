Title: Clinical Significance of Diffusion-Weighted Brain MRI Lesions After TAVR: Results of a Patient-Level Pooled Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute brain infarction detected by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) is common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), but its clinical relevance is uncertain.
OBJECTIVES: The authors investigated the relationship between DW-MRI total lesion number (TLN), individual lesion volume (ILV), and total lesion volume (TLV) and clinical stroke outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: Patient-level data were pooled from 4 prospective TAVR embolic protection studies, with consistent predischarge DW-MRI acquisition and core laboratory analysis. C-statistic was used to determine the best DW-MRI measure associated with clinical stroke.
RESULTS: A total of 495 of 603 patients undergoing TAVR completed the predischarge DW-MRI. At 30 days, the rate of clinical ischemic stroke was 6.9%. Acute ischemic brain injury was seen in 85% of patients with 5.5 ± 7.3 discrete lesions per patient, mean ILV of 78.2 ± 257.1 mm3, and mean TLV of 555 ± 1,039 mm3. The C-statistic was 0.84 for TLV, 0.81 for number of lesions, and 0.82 for maximum ILV in predicting ischemic stroke. On the basis of the TLV cutpoint as defined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC), patients with a TLV &gt;500 mm3 (vs TLV ≤500 mm3) had more ischemic stroke (18.2% vs 2.3%; P &lt; 0.0001), more disabling strokes (8.8% vs 0.9%; P &lt; 0.0001), and less complete stroke recovery (44% vs 62.5%; P = 0.001) at 30 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study confirms that the number, size, and total volume of acute brain infarction defined by DW-MRI are each associated with clinical ischemic strokes, disabling strokes, and worse stroke recovery in patients undergoing TAVR and may have value as surrogate outcomes in stroke prevention trials.
