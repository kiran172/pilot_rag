Title: Coronary Access After TAVR With a Cylindrical-Shaped Valve: Learning From LOTUS.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Data on the feasibility of coronary access (CA) through above or outside of the cylindrical shaped-transcatheter heart valve (THV) are very limited. The aims of the present study were to assess the feasibility of CA after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with the LOTUS using multi detector computed tomography (MDCT) and the reliability of algorithm detecting unfavorable CA.
METHODS/MATERIALS: Post-TAVR MDCT of 41 patients with 82 coronary arteries were evaluated. The relationship and distance between the THV flame and sinotubular junction (STJ) and coronary ostia were assessed. Unfavorable CA was defined as the valve-to-STJ distance < 2-mm or the valve-to-coronary ostia distance < 2-mm if the THV flame was above STJ or coronary ostia.
RESULTS: MDCT-identified unfavorable CA was observed in 29.3% for the left coronary artery and 41.5% for the right coronary artery. In total, 53.7% of patients had at least one unfavorable CA and 14.6% of those had unfavorable CA for both left and right coronary artery. While patients underwent coronary angiography after TAVR, the success rates of selective coronary cannulation were significantly lower in patients with MDCT-identified unfavorable CA in comparison to those with favorable CA for left (20.0% vs. 100%, P = 0.002) and right coronary artery (0% vs. 100%, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Future CA through above or outside of a cylindrical shaped THV may be challenging with a significant probability. Our algorithm identifying unfavorable CA using post-MDCT seems to be useful for estimating the risk of unsuccessful selective cannulation.
