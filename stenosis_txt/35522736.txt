Title: A Multifactorial Analysis of Extracranial Carotid Disease: A Comprehensive Approach to Sonographic Criteria.

Abstract: The present study brings a pictorial review aimed to discuss the multifactorial interpretation of extracranial carotid atheromatous disease, contemplating not only the degree of stenosis but also the arterial flow patterns, the intima-media thickness and the morphological characteristics of the atheromatous plaque. We merged the recommendations contained in the different reference literature on the topic to give a comprehensive approach to ultrasound criteria for diagnostic carotid examination. We infer that the carotid ultrasound evaluation must include important predictors of cardiovascular risk, which should be written in the ultrasound reports, thus allowing the adequate clinical approach to the disease.
