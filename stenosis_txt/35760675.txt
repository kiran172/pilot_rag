Title: Ten-year outcome of one-anastomosis gastric bypass with a biliopancreatic limb of 150 cm versus Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a single-institution series of 940 patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term outcomes of one-anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB) need to be compared with those of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB).
OBJECTIVE: The present study evaluates the long-term outcomes at 10-year follow-up of OAGB with a biliopancreatic limb of 150 cm versus RYGB.
SETTING: Private practice, France.
METHODS: Data of patients who underwent OAGB or RYGB as primary or secondary procedures between 2010 and 2011 at a referral center were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively.
RESULTS: A total of 940 patients underwent OAGB (n = 405) or RYGB (n = 535). Operative time was significantly shorter in the OAGB group. Postoperative morbidity occurred in 17.2% of patients after RYGB versus 8.1% after OAGB (P â‰¤ .0001). Patients in the RYGB group had a significantly higher rate of kinking of the jejuno-jejunal anastomosis, stenosis of the gastrojejunal anastomosis, and dysphagia for early ulcers. At long term, no differences were found in the rate of severe malnutrition. Cumulated morbidity was significantly higher after RYGB, with higher incidence of internal hernia, anastomotic ulcer, blind-loop syndrome, and hypoglycemia. Conversion to RYGB and laparoscopic exploration for chronic pain were more frequent after OAGB. Surgery for weight regain was significantly more frequent after RYGB. Patients in the OAGB group had significantly lower weight, body mass index, and greater percentage excess, and total weight losses at 120 months. No significant differences were detected in co-morbidity outcomes.
CONCLUSION: After 10 years, both RYGB and OAGB are effective procedures. However, OAGB is associated with shorter operative times and better results in short- and long-term morbidity and weight loss outcomes.
