Title: Oblique Carinal End-to-end Anastomosis for Pig Bronchus in Organ Donor and Lung Transplant Recipient.

Abstract: Pig bronchi are rare anomalies in which the right upper lobe bronchus originates above the carina. During surgery this can lead to technical challenges associated with the bronchial anastomosis, especially during lung transplantation. We herein report the case of a combined liver-lung transplantation with a pig bronchus in both the organ donor and transplant recipient. In both cases the bronchi originated slightly above the level of the carina facilitating an oblique resection and a single tracheobronchial anastomosis with a running suture. Follow-up bronchoscopy showed a completely healed anastomosis with no evidence of malacia or stenosis.
