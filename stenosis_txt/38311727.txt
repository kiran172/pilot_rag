Title: A Y-incision to enlarge the aortic root for aortic valve stenosis with anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anomalous aortic origin of the coronary artery (AAOCA) is a rare congenital heart disease. Therefore, optimal indications for surgery in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) complicated by AAOCA remain uncertain.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 57-year-old male patient who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) and aortic root enlargement using a Y-incision procedure for severe AS with an anomalous aortic origin of the right coronary artery (AAORCA). Since preoperative single-photon emission computed tomography revealed no ischaemic lesions, an aortic root enlargement with a Y-incision was performed to prevent the potential compression of the prosthetic valve on the AAOCA and prosthesis-patient mismatch.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative evaluation of the coronary anatomy and myocardial ischaemia using advanced imaging modalities and aortic root enlargement with the Y-incision procedure is an effective strategy for preventing ischaemic complications in cases of severe AS with AAORCA.
