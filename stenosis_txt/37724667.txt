Title: Application of color Doppler ultrasound to evaluate and analyze the risk factors of residual stenosis after vertebral artery origin stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vertebral artery origin stenting (VAOS) is the mainstream method for the treatment of vertebral artery stenosis (VAS). However, there are few studies on the risk factors analysis for residual stenosis after VAOS.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to apply color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) to evaluate and analyze the risk factors of residual stenosis after VAOS.
METHODS: About 178 patients with VAOS were included from 2017 to 2019 in Liuzhou worker's hospital and divided into the residual stenosis group (n = 38) and the no-residual stenosis group (n = 140). The clinical data and hemodynamics alteration before and after VAOS were collected. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors of residual stenosis.
RESULTS: Compared with the no-residual stenosis group, the proportion of hypertension, the bending of the initial segment, and the residual stenosis length > 10 mm in the residual stenosis group were significantly higher, while the original internal diameter was significantly smaller (P < 0.05). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the bending of initial segment (OR = 2.41, 95% CI: 1.32-5.45, P = 0.033), the original internal diameter (OR = 2.29, 95% CI: 1.13-5.66, P = 0.001), and the residual stenosis length > 10 mm were the risk factors of residual stenosis (OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 1.82-5.85, P = 0.044).
CONCLUSION: The bending of initial segment, the original internal diameter, and the residual stenosis length > 10 mm were the risk factors of residual stenosis after VAOS.
