Title: A retrospective study from a single center to compare outcomes in 79 patients with in-stent restenosis treated with paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty or drug-eluting stent implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite the recent progress made in drug-eluting stents (DESs), in-stent restenosis (ISR) is still a common complication of percutaneous coronary interventions. This retrospective study from a single center aimed to compare outcomes in 79 patients with ISR treated with paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) angioplasty or DES implantation.
RESULTS: From January 2017 to December 2021, 83 ISR lesions from 79 patients were included. Thirty-two were treated with PCB and 51 treated with available DES in the catheterization laboratory. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. Mean time between index angioplasty and restenosis was 27 months with a minimum of 4 months and a maximum of 70 months. Concerning Mehran ISR angiographic classification, classes II and III were more likely treated with DES. Stenosis diameter and minimal lumen diameter (MLD) were similar in both groups. PCB used was significantly shorter than DES: Mean length was 19.75 ± 5.7 versus 22.1 ± 16.5 (p < 0.001), respectively. Angiographic results immediately after intervention were similar in both groups: In-segment MLD after the procedure was 2.5 ± 0.4 in the DES group and 2.26 ± 0.55 in the PCB group. A median follow-up of 20 months was achieved for 68 patients, and 11 were lost to follow-up. There was also no difference in both groups regarding free from events survival.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this study support recent international studies that have shown no significant differences between DES and PCB and in-stent restenosis. This suggests that PCB use is an option to consider in our local daily practice.
