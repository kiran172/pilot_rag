Title: Improving the Quality of Life of a Kidney Transplant Patient With Limb Edema: Amplatzer Vascular Plug Embolization of an Arteriovenous Fistula.

Abstract: An arteriovenous fistula is the preferred vascular access option for hemodialysis patients. However, complications, such as high-output heart failure and upper limb edema due to central vein stenosis, may arise.  We describe a case of a 65-year-old kidney transplant patient with severe edema in the left arm due to central vein stenosis and ipsilateral umerocephalic arteriovenous fistula. He was a previous hemodialysis patient and received his kidney transplant in 2015. This patient had an eight-month waiting list to undergo surgical ligation of the arteriovenous fistula. Since his quality of life was decaying, we decided to perform a peripheral vascular embolization with Amplatzer® vascular plugs (Abbott, Green Oaks, IL). After a two-month follow-up, the arm edema was significantly reduced, and no immediate complications were reported. This case highlights that the Amplatzer® vascular plug is a safe and effective alternative for arteriovenous fistula embolization in patients with arm edema due to central vein stenosis.
