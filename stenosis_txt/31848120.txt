Title: Efficacy and safety of a mother-child technique for recanalization of chronic central venous occlusive disease in hemodialysis patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: There is no optimal treatment for central vein occlusive disease that remains a major contributor to vascular access impairment. This study aimed to review the outcomes of percutaneous treatment with a mother-child technique in the treatment of symptomatic central venous stenosis (CVS) and central venous occlusion (CVO) in patients on hemodialysis.
METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively and included all consecutive patients with CVS or CVO who were treated with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting. The occlusive lesions were crossed using the mother-child technique with an angiographic catheter-in-guiding catheter system.
RESULTS: A total of 36 patients with symptomatic CVS and 45 patients with total CVO were included. The average age and gender composition were similar between the two groups. Patients with CVO had higher prevalence of diabetic nephropathy than CVS (24.4% vs 5.6%; P < .05). Lesion success, device success, and procedural success were achieved in 36 (100%), 1 (100%), and 36 (100%) patients in the CVS group and in 43 (95.6%), 11 (100%), and 43 (95.6%) patients in the CVO group, respectively. There were no severe complications or procedure-related deaths in either group. During follow-up (median, 6 months), the primary patency rates were 89.7% (CVS) and 81.0% (CVO) at 6 months and were 54.2% (CVS) and 47.1% (CVO) at 12 months. The assisted primary patency rates were 100% (CVS) and 91.2% (CVO) at 6 and 12 months.
CONCLUSIONS: With extra backup support of the mother-child technique, percutaneous treatment provides an effective and safe method for recanalization of chronic venous occlusion in patients on hemodialysis.
