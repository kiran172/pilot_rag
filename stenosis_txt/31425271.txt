Title: Left Ventricular Assist Device Outflow Graft Obstruction: A Case Series.

Abstract: Dysfunction of different components within continuous-flow (CF) left ventricular assist device (LVAD) systems may cause adverse cardiovascular and end-organ sequelae. Outflow graft obstruction is a recognized type of LVAD component dysfunction. Ten patients were admitted and treated for LVAD outflow graft obstruction. Two of these patients subsequently developed recurrent outflow graft obstruction requiring reintervention; however, each reoccurrence was at a different site than the original obstruction. Thus, a total of 12 cases of obstruction were analyzed. The most common reasons for hospital admission were low flow LVAD alarms or decompensated heart failure. Presentation with outflow graft obstruction occurred an average of 3.0 years after LVAD implantation. Patients underwent echocardiographic evaluation at the time of admission. Left ventricular assist device component dysfunction was suspected based on echocardiographic findings, and follow-up contrast studies were used to establish the specific diagnosis of outflow graft stenosis. The majority of stenotic lesions (10/12) were treated percutaneously with balloon angioplasty and stenting with balloon-expandable endovascular prostheses. Postintervention, all patients had significant improvement in LVAD flow rates.
