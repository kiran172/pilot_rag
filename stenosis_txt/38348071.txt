Title: Comparative Analysis of Left Ventricular Mass Regression Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement - a Single Center Experience from Romania.

Abstract: Introduction: Severe aortic stenosis is often associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). Elevated left ventricular mass (LVM) is linked to higher cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has been the standard treatment, but transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) offers an alternative for high-risk surgical patients. Understanding how these interventions affect left ventricular mass regression is crucial. Materials and methods: This retrospective study analyzed 315 patients treated between December 2014 and December 2022, categorizing them into surgical and transcatheter treatment groups. Clinical and echocardiographic data were collected at baseline and six-month follow-up. Statistical analysis assessed differences between groups and predictors of LV mass reduction. Results:The overall dataset indicated an average percentage reduction in LVM of 10.86%±29.41%. Segmenting the data, the TAVI subgroup exhibited a reduction of 4.28%±30.31%, while the SAVR subgroup highlighted a pronounced decline of 17.92%±26.76%. Preoperative LVMi and mean pressure gradient positively correlated with LVM reduction, while TAVI negatively impacted it. Conclusions: Both TAVI and SAVR interventions yield benefits in reducing left ventricular mass, with SAVR showing a superior outcome. Recognizing predictors of LV mass regression is crucial for optimizing treatment strategies, and early valve replacement should be considered to prevent irreversible LV hypertrophy.
