Title: Severe aortic stenosis during leptin replacement therapy in a patient with generalized lipodystrophy-associated progeroid syndrome due to an LMNA variant: A case report.

Abstract: Leptin replacement therapy (LRT) has drastically improved the prognosis of patients with lipodystrophy, but pro-inflammatory properties of leptin could become evident in the long term. Here, we report a 30-year-old Japanese woman with generalized lipodystrophy-associated progeroid syndrome due to a heterozygous LMNA variant (c.29C > T; p.T10I), who was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis (AS) after more than a decade of LRT, which required transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Given her marked hypoadiponectinemia and the LMNA variant, our patient might have been susceptible to progeria-associated disorders, including aortic stenosis, which could have been exaggerated by the prolonged 'imbalanced adipokines' caused by LRT between pro-inflammatory leptin and anti-inflammatory adiponectin. Thus, long-term LRT could be associated with AS in patients with the LMNA variant to cause generalized lipodystrophy-associated progeroid syndrome and hypoadiponectinemia.
