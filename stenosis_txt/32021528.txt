Title: Exploring The Current Management Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension, And Understanding The Role Of Dural Venous Sinus Stenting.

Abstract: Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) is a debilitating disorder characterised by raised intracranial pressure (ICP), papilloedema with the potential risk of permanent visual loss, and headaches that are profoundly disabling and reduce the quality of life. The first consensus guidelines have been published on investigation and management of adult IIH and one key area of uncertainty is the utility of dural venous sinus stenting for the management of headache and visual loss. There are an increasing number of series published and to help understand the successes and complications. During a patient physician priority setting, the understanding of the best type of intervention to treat IIH was assigned to the top 10 of most desired research questions for the disease. Ultimately randomised clinical trials (RCTs) in neurovascular stenting for IIH would be instructive, as the literature to date may suffer from publication bias. Due to the increasing incidence of IIH, there is no better time to systematically investigate interventions that may reverse the disease process and achieve remission. In this review we discuss the pathophysiology of IIH in relation to venous sinus stenosis, the role of venous sinus stenting with a review of the relevant literature, the advantages and disadvantages of stenting compared with other surgical interventions, and the future of stenting in the treatment of IIH.
