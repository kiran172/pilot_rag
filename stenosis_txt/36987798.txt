Title: Endovascular Treatment of Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis: A Single-Center Retrospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Endovascular therapy is the most common treatment for transplant renal artery stenosis; however, its long-term outcomes remain controversial, with no uniform standard for percutaneous transluminal angioplasty versus percutaneous transluminal stenting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 26 patients with transplant renal artery stenosis who underwent endovascular therapy. We evaluated long-term efficacy of endovascular therapy and the reasonable choice of treatment.
RESULTS: Serum creatinine increased significantly at onset of transplant renal artery stenosis (113.88 ± 37.573 before vs 279.31 ± 94.98 μmol/L during stenosis; P1 < .001), and endovascular therapy had a good short-term effect (279.31 ± 94.98 during stenosis vs 139.54 ± 124.40 μmol/L at 2 weeks posttreatment; P2 = .002). Long-term efficacy of endovascular therapy was stable (139.54 ± 124.40 at 2 weeks posttreatment vs 150.69 ± 180.72 at 6 months vs 161.58 ± 174.49 μmol/L at last follow-up; P3 > .05). Blood pressure increased significantly at onset of transplant renal artery stenosis (126.65 ± 16.11 before vs 159.62 ± 25.84 mm Hg during stenosis; P1 < .001). Moreover, the short-term effect of endovascular therapy was good (159.62 ± 25.84 during stenosis vs 128.73 ± 14.22 mm Hg at 2 weeks posttreatment; P2 < .001). Long-term effects remained stable (128.73 ± 14.22 at 2 weeks posttreatment vs 131.15 ± 14.55 at 6 months vs 138.50 ± 16.82 mm Hg at last follow-up; P3 > .05). Peak systolic velocity decreased significantly after endovascular therapy (176.6 ± 67.93 during stenosis vs 114.24 ± 67.93 cm/s at 2 weeks posttreatment; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular therapy is effective in transplant renal artery stenosis treatment and has a low incidence of complications. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty should be performed routinely during endovascular therapy. After dilation, if stenosis remains >25% or retracted, then percutaneous transluminal stenting is recommended. Otherwise, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is preferred.
