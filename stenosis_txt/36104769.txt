Title: The strategy of removing tracheal stents by using an interventional technique under fluoroscopy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheal stent implantation is widely used in clinic settings. Timely removal of tracheal stents could prevent or reduce related complications. This study was aimed at evaluating the feasibility and safety of removing tracheal stents by an interventional technique under fluoroscopy.
METHODS: Clinical data of patients with self-expanding uncovered tracheal stents removed by an interventional technique under fluoroscopy were analyzed retrospectively, including medical records, imaging findings, surgical records, and follow-up results. According to the type and time of stent placement and the proliferation of granulation tissue under bronchoscopy, different tracheal stent removal techniques were used to remove the tracheal stent under fluoroscopy, and the feasibility and safety of the interventions were analyzed.
RESULTS: In all, 148 tracheal stents were removed from 112 patients; 95.9% (142/148) of the stents were completely removed and 4.1% (6/148) had a small amount of metal residue, and foreign-body forceps were removed under fiber bronchoscopy guidance. In 78 (69.6%), 32 (21.6%), and 6 (5.4%) patients, the tracheal stent was removed by the internal stripping, direct removal, and stent-in-stent methods, respectively. The overall stent removal time ranged from 11 to 111 (28.9 ± 20.1) min. During stent removal, 16 (14.3%) and 13 (11.6%) patients developed mild and moderate complications, respectively. There were no serious complications such as massive hemorrhage, mediastinal fistula, or death.
CONCLUSIONS: An interventional technique under fluoroscopy for stent removal is a feasible, safe, and effective method and could serve as a technique for tracheal stent removal in clinical settings.
