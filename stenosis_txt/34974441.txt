Title: The challenging airway: Tracheal agenesis in the newborn.

Abstract: A preterm female presented with severe respiratory distress in the delivery room and was found to have tracheal agenesis with a tracheoesophageal fistula and a congenital heart defect. Tracheal agenesis is uncommon and is often associated with other congenital abnormalities. Although there are surgical options for repair, mortality remains high.
