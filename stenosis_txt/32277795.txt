Title: Incidence, risk, and treatment of binary restenosis after vertebral artery stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In-stent restenosis (ISR) is the major concern of vertebral artery stenting (VAS). We aimed to investigate the feasibility and outcome of redo angioplasty for ISR of vertebral artery.
METHOD: The patients were retrospectively reviewed for the significant ISR (>50%). Redo angioplasty including balloon angioplasty and stenting was performed for symptomatic ISR (>50%) or asymptomatic ISR (≥70%). The clinical follow-up was performed on the 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then yearly in the clinic or by telephone. The angiographic follow-up was performed at 6-12 months after redo angioplasty.
RESULT: A total of 72 patients had significant ISR and 48 redo angioplasty (92.3%, 48/52) were successfully achieved with 13 located in the V4 and 35 in the ostium of vertebral artery. Twenty-six lesions were implanted by the second stent and the others received balloon angioplasty. No stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred in the perioperative time. One patient died 2 months after redo angioplasty due to nonstroke cause. Redo angioplasty nonsignificantly decreased the stroke or TIA compared with medical treatment. Sixteen patients developed the binary restenosis, which was lower in the patients receiving stent implantation than balloon angioplasty.
CONCLUSION: Redo angioplasty was a feasible method for the ISR of VAS and redo stenting might be the first choice.
