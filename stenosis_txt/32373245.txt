Title: Transcatheter valve-in-valve aortic valve replacement with bioprosthetic valve Fracture/Stretching technique in a degenerated mitroflow valve.

Abstract: We describe a successful bioprosthetic annular stretching in a patient with severe prosthetic aortic valve stenosis from a degenerated 19-mm Mitroflow valve (Sorin Group USA Inc, Arvada, CO, USA). This technique allowed for implantation of a 23-mm Evolut-R Pro valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with significant improvement in hemodynamics after prosthetic annular stretching. We have also summarized other case series and case reports which have previously described similar techniques. &lt;Learning objective: Transcatheter valve-in-valve procedure may not be feasible in certain patients who have a relatively smaller size bioprosthetic valve. Cracking/stretching the annular ring of the smaller prosthetic valve to deploy a larger transcatheter valve is a potential option in these patients. Clinicians must be cognizant of the possible pitfalls, contraindications, and other technical aspects to choose the right patient for this procedure.&gt;.
