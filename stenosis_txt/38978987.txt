Title: Delayed Displacement of Enterprise Stent in Treating Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 53-year-old patient was admitted to the stroke unit with sudden onset of weakness on the left side and dysarthria. This patient had been diagnosed with symptomatic intracerebral artery stenosis two months previously and had been administered dual oral antiplatelet agents and an aggressive dose of atorvastatin. The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting two weeks after admission. Interventional treatment was technically successful when a self-expandable Enterprise stent was used. She was followed up for 2 years after discharge, without any cerebrovascular incidents. Repeat CTA revealed delayed displacement of the Enterprise stent and a discussion was had.
