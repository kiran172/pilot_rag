Title: Long-term outcome of Crohn's disease patients with upper gastrointestinal stricture: A GETAID study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are few data concerning patients with Crohn's disease (CD) complicated by a stricture of the upper gastrointestinal tract (UGT).
AIMS: We evaluated the outcome and management of CD patients complicated by a stricture of the UGT.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective multicenter study including all CD patients with a non-passable symptomatic UGT stricture on endoscopy. Primary outcome measure was surgery-free survival from diagnosis of stricture. Efficacy of medical, endoscopic, and surgical treatments, and identification of predictors of surgery were also evaluated.
RESULTS: 60 CD patients with an UGT stricture were included. 60% of the strictures were located in the duodenum. With a median follow-up of 5.5 (IQR: 3.0-12.0) years since stricture diagnosis, surgical-free survival was 75% and 64% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. At the end of the follow up, 27 (45%) patients underwent surgery. 77 endoscopic procedures were performed in 30 patients with an immediate success of 81% and a clinical benefit in 84% of the procedures. In multivariate analysis, anti-TNF treatment initiation was associated with a reduced risk of surgery.
CONCLUSION: CD UGT strictures are mainly located in the duodenum. Medical and endoscopic treatments allow to avoid surgery in half of the patients.
