Title: Percu-Ax aortic valve implantation with a double arm approach: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transaxillary route for structural and coronary percutaneous interventions represents a valid alternative access in patients with obstructive peripheral disease. Nevertheless, its widespread use is limited by a less manageable haemostasis procedure.
CASE SUMMARY: In this case, we describe a minimalistic high-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) procedure (TAVI Score 6.42%) conducted with a double arm approach (radial and axillary accesses) in an 88-year-old patient with severe aortic stenosis and multiple co-morbidities preventing both surgical (Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality 7.9%) and percutaneous transfemoral approach (extensive peripheral artery disease). We also described the successful management of a complicated transaxillary haemostasis with this technique.
DISCUSSION: In our cases, a minimalist double-arm approach was successfully used for TAVI procedure as an alternative to transfemoral approach assuring effective and safe management of vascular access haemostasis.
