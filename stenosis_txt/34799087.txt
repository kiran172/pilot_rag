Title: Epidemiology of Aortic Stenosis/Aortic Valve Replacement (from the Nationwide Swedish Renal Registry).

Abstract: Contemporary data on the prevalence and incidence of aortic stenosis (AS) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) in patients initiating dialysis are scarce. This observational cohort study aimed to estimate (1) the point prevalence of AS and AVR at dialysis start and (2) the AS incidence and associated factors prospective to dialysis initiation. The study included 14,550 patients initiating dialysis registered in the Swedish Renal Registry between 2005 and 2018. AS was defined by the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes, and AVR by the surgical procedure codes. Associations between covariates and outcomes were assessed in Cox regression models. The median age was 68 (57 to 77), 66% were males, and the point prevalence of AS and AVR was 3.4% and 1.1%, respectively. In those without known AS/AVR at dialysis initiation (n = 14,050), AS was diagnosed in 595 patients (incidence 16.3/1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval [CI] 15.1 to 17.7/1,000 person-years) during a median follow-up of 2.7 years (interquartile range 1.1 to 5.7). In adjusted Cox regression models, higher age (hazard ratio [HR] 1.03, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.04), male gender (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.25 to 1.83), atrial fibrillation (HR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.64), and hypertension (HR 1.65, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.65) were associated with incident AS. Peritoneal dialysis patients had a nonsignificant trend toward higher AS risk compared with hemodialysis (HR 1.18, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.40). About 20% of patients (n = 113) diagnosed with incident AS underwent AVR (incidence 3.1/1000 person-years, 95% CI 2.6 to 3.7/1,000). Only the male gender was associated with AVR (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.30 to 3.30). In conclusion, the prevalence and incidence of AS and AVR in patients initiating dialysis are high. A fifth of newly diagnosed AS underwent AVR after dialysis onset.
