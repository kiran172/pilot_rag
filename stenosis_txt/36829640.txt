Title: Computational Study of Hemodynamic Field of an Occluded Artery Model with Anastomosis.

Abstract: In this research work, the hemodynamic field of an occluded artery with anastomosis by means of computational simulation has been studied. The main objective of the current study is the investigation of 3D flow field phenomena in the by-pass region and the effect of the bypass graft to stenosis volume flow ratio on their formation. The anastomosis type was end-to-side with a 45° angle, while stenosis imposed a 75% area blockage of the aorta vessel and the total volume flow was 220 lt/h. The computational study of the flow field was utilized via a laminar flow model and three turbulence models (k-ε RNG, standard k-ω, and k-ω SST). Numerical results were compared qualitatively with experimental visualizations carried out under four different flow conditions, varying according to the flow ratio between the stenosis and the anastomotic graft. Comparison between computational results and experimental visualization findings exhibited a good agreement. Results showed that SST k-ω turbulence models reproduce better visually obtained flow patterns. Furthermore, cross-sectional velocity distributions demonstrated two distinct flow patterns down the bypass graft, depending on the flow ratio. Low values of flow ratio are characterized by fluid rolling up, whereas for high values fluid volume twisting was observed. Finally, areas with low wall shear stresses were mapped, as these are more prone to postoperative degradation of the bypass graft due to the development of subendothelial hyperplasia.
