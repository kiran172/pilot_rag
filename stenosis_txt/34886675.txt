Title: A further step in the differential diagnosis of refractory abdominal pain: cryptogenic multifocal ulcerous stenosing enteritis.

Abstract: We present the case of a 45-year-old male smoker, who presented with intermittent abdominal pain related to intake since one year previously. During the study, positive anti-transglutaminase antibodies were detected, leading to a diagnosis of celiac disease, with no improvement of the clinical symptoms despite total suspension of gluten. The study was completed by magnetic resonance (MR) enterography, detecting extensive and ill-defined inflammatory alterations in the jejunum and proximal ileum walls.
