Title: Biliary complications after adult to adult right-lobe living donor liver transplantation (A-ARLLDLT): Analysis of 245 cases during 16 years period at a single high centre- A retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Biliary complications (BCs) after adult to adult living donor liver transplantation (A-ALDLT) result in poor graft and patient survival. This study aimed to analyze these complications.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed BCs in 245 recipients who underwent A-ALDLT using the right-lobe graft during 16 years period in our centre. The overall male/female ratio was 215/30.
RESULTS: One hundred fifty-five BCs affected 102 of our recipients (95 early (≤3months) and 60 late (≥3months)). They were classified as 67/245(27.3%) early bile leak, 10/245(4.1%) early biliary stricture, 44/245(17.9%) late biliary stricture, 4/245(1.6%) early cholangitis, 10/245(4.1%) late cholangitis, 14/245(5.7%) early biloma, and 6/245(2.4%) late cholangitic abscesses. Multiple biliary anastomoses were independently correlated with Post liver transplantation (LT) overall BCs; moreover, post LT hepatic artery thrombosis or stenosis (HAT/S) was an independent predictor of overall BCs, strictures and leaks. The mortality affected 96(39.2%) cases mostly due to sepsis, bleeding and multi-organ failure (MOF). On the other hand, the biliary related mortality was 10.6% of cases. Multiple cholangitic hepatic abscesses were significant predictors of poor graft and patient outcomes. Conclusions: Multiple biliary anastomoses and post LT HAT/S lead to a poor biliary outcome, furthermore, cholangitis, cholangitic abscesses and sepsis lead to poor graft and patient outcomes, so proper management of those variables is mandatory to improve outcomes after A-ARLLDLT.
