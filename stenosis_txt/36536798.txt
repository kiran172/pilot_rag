Title: Enterprise 2 Stent-Assisted Embolization of Paraclinoid Aneurysms: A Single Center Preliminary Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Enterprise stent has been widely used for assisted embolization in wide-necked aneurysms while delayed ischemia or thromboembolic complications for its incomplete stent apposition. The purpose of this study was to summarize and analyze the clinical experience of using Enterprise 2 (EP2) stent-assisted embolization in the treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms.
METHODS: From January 2019 to December 2020, the clinical and imaging data of 98 patients with paraclinoid aneurysms treated with EP2 stent-assisted embolization were enrolled retrospectively. Preliminary experience and follow-up outcomes of EP2 stent-assisted embolization of paraclinoid aneurysms were assessed by using the Raymond grade and modified Rankin Scale.
RESULTS: Of the 98 aneurysms, all stents were released satisfactorily. The immediate postprocedural angiography revealed a complete occlusion of the aneurysms with 77.55% of the (76/98) patients, and the last follow-up angiograms showed complete occlusion with 83.67% of the (82/98) patients. The average aneurysm size was (4.11 ± 1.25) mm, the aneurysm diameter was (4.41 ± 1.37) mm, the vessel radius was (3.87 ± 0.32) mm, the diameter at the distal of stent was (3.23 ± 0.21) mm, and the proximal was (4.18 ± 0.23) mm. Among the 98 aneurysms, 13 cases had incomplete stent apposition, 3 cases had intraoperative knotting, and the stents were improved post adjusted; 2 cases had vasospasm and 1 case had stenosis during operation, the symptoms were improved after symptomatic treatment. The result demonstrated that stent length and inner bending radius of parent artery were the pivotal factors affecting incomplete stent apposition (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: The EP2 stent for the treatment of paraclinoid aneurysms is safe and effective, however, the length of the stent and the inner bending radius of parent artery are important factors affecting incomplete stent apposition.
