Title: A case of massive saddle pulmonary embolism and benign tracheal stenosis in a patient with COVID-19 infection.

Abstract: Since December 2019, the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, has become a global pandemic affecting millions of people around the globe. These patients are prone to a number of complications either related to their disease or to the different treatment modalities. Pulmonary embolism (PE) and benign post-intubation tracheal stenosis (BTS) are among these complications. In this study, we report the case of a patient with a recent COVID-19 infection that got complicated by a massive PE as well as a BTS.
