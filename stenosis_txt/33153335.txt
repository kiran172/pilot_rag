Title: Remodeling of occluded internal carotid artery in vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the remodeling pattern of the extracranial occluded internal carotid artery (OICA) by vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (VWI).
METHODS: Thirty-nine atherosclerotic OICAs from 32 consecutive cases underwent 3-Tesla VWI to acquire pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted two-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery fast spin echo sequences. 25 symptomatic CAs exhibited ipsilateral downstream cerebral ischemia or ophthalmic artery embolism within last three months. The 14 remaining CAs were asymptomatic. Twenty-four CAs from 22 patients with atherosclerosis but no stenosis were recruited as control group. The outer wall area (OWA) was calculated based on the outer contour of the carotid artery drawn on the pre-contrast VWI. Negative remodeling was defined as a lower OWA compared to that of control group.
RESULTS: Clinical characteristics including age, sex and vascular risk factors showed no significant difference between the occluded and control group. However, the OWA was lower in the occluded group than in the control group (0.63 versus 0.90 cm2, p = 0.004). For all OICAs, the OWA was larger in symptomatic cases than asymptomatic cases (0.71 versus 0.49cm2, p = 0.025). Using a cutoff value of 0.44, the sensitivity and specificity of OWA for detecting symptomatic OICA were 0.88 and 0.57, respectively. Heterogeneous signal intensity and enhancement were more often observed at the proximal than the distal segment of occlusion (p &lt; 0.001). The inter-observer agreement regarding the evaluation of VWI characteristics was desirable (κ = 0.805 ∼ 0.847).
CONCLUSIONS: Negative remodeling is prevalent in OICA, especially in asymptomatic cases.
