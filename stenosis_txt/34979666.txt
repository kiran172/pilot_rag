Title: The Relationship between Patterns of Remodeling and Degree of Enhancement in Patients with Atherosclerotic Middle Cerebral Artery Stenosis: A High-Resolution MRI Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this research was to investigate the relationship between remodeling patterns and degree of enhancement in patients with atherosclerotic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From August 2015 to May 2016, 38 consecutive patients with unilateral MCA stenosis on time-of-flight (TOF) MR angiography were prospectively enrolled. The routine MR scan and cross-sectional images of the stenotic MCA vessel wall on HR-MRI were performed in all patients. Among them, 17 patients displayed positive remodeling (PR) and the other 21 patients displayed negative remodeling or non-remodeling (non-PR). The patients displaying hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in the territory of ipsilateral stenotic MCA were considered to have had acute stroke. Subsequently, the differences in the degree of enhancement and the number of acute stroke patients between the PR group and the non-PR group were compared. The Spearman rank correlation analysis of the enhancement degree (ED) and the remodeling index (RI) was calculated. Then, receiver operating curve (ROC) was used to evaluate diagnostic efficiency of RI and ED for acute infarction.
RESULTS: The PR group had more obvious enhancement plaques than the non-PR group (10 versus 3, P = 0.006). The PR group also had a larger number of acute stroke patients than the non-PR group (15 versus 4, P = 0.000). The spear-man rank correlation analysis showed that the degree of enhancement had a weak positive correlation with the remodeling index (r = 0.379, P = 0.019). The area under the curve (AUC) of RI and ED was higher than that of RI (0.924: 0.842).
CONCLUSION: The PR, obvious enhancement predicted vulnerable plaques that were more prone to causing acute stroke. RI and ED had valuable diagnostic efficiency for acute infarction.
