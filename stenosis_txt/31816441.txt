Title: A new case of KIAA0753-related variant of Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy.

Abstract: A narrow thorax with shortening of long bones is usually pointing to dysfunction of the primary cilia corresponding clinically to ciliopathies with major skeletal involvement. Mutations in at least 23 genes are likely to correspond to this clinical presentation: IFT43/52/80/81/122/140/172, WDR19/34/35/60, DYNC2H1, DYNC2LI1, CEP120, NEK1, TTC21B, TCTEX1D2, INTU, TCTN3, EVC 1/2 and KIAA0586. In addition to these, KIAA0753 variants were recently described in seven patients with Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) (two first cousins, one unrelated patient and one fetus), Joubert syndrome (two siblings) and orofaciodigital syndrome type 6 (one patient). We present the clinical characteristics of a eighth such patient. This 4 year-old boy with narrow thorax, short limbs, severe respiratory and feeding difficulties from birth on had a history of hypotonia and developmental delay. On skeletal survey, short tubular bones (height - 5,5 SD) and a trident appearance of the pelvis were seen. Brain MRI showed cervical canal stenosis. Renal function was normal and moderate hepatomegaly was noted. A homozygous c.943C > T mutation in KIAA0753 was identified on whole exome sequencing, resulting in Gln315Ter premature termination of the corresponding protein. This case provides confirmation of an additional molecular basis for skeletal dysplasia and illustrates how ciliopathies due to mutations in a single gene may present as apparently distinct syndromes.
