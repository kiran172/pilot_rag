Abstract: Congenital malformations of the pinna and aural atresia can result in major aesthetic and functional deficits. Knowledge about embryologic developments and established classification systems is an essential requirement when dealing with affected patients. Early detection of deficiencies and introduction of appropriate diagnostic measures is vital to initiate adequate therapies and prevent long-term disabilities. Treatment for malformations of the pinna-if requested-is mostly surgical, infrequently an epithesis is applied. As in other surgical fields, tissue engineering will likely play a crucial role in the future. Treatment of aural stenosis and atresia aims at improvement of hearing levels and prevention of secondary complications like cholesteatoma and chronic otorrhea. Auditory rehabilitation comprises a spectrum from conventional hearing aids to invasive hearing implants, the latter being favored in recent years.
