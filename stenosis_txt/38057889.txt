Title: Comparison between canine and porcine models of chronic deep venous thrombosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To first induce chronic deep venous thrombosis in the left iliac veins of canines and porcines and then compare these two models to validate endovascular treatment devices.
METHODS: Thrombin and fibrinogen were used to produce a solid thrombus in the left iliac veins of a stenosis model. The researchers used venous angiography and histological staining to investigate the progression of thrombosis.
RESULTS: A left iliac vein thrombus was successfully formed in all experimental animals, including six Labrador dogs and three Bama miniature pigs, and there was minimal surgical bleeding. All dogs survived until 90 days, and three pigs died on Days 29, 33, and 58.
CONCLUSION: The researchers first established the models and then observed the progression of chronic deep venous thrombosis of the iliac vein in large animals for up to 90 days. Dogs are better suited for chronic deep venous thrombosis models due to their uncomplicated anatomy, excellent obedience, and proneness to physical activity compared with pigs.
