Title: Remote ECG monitoring to reduce complications following transcatheter aortic valve implantations: the Redirect TAVI study.

Abstract: AIMS: The optimal strategy of monitoring for conduction disturbances in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is uncertain. We evaluated a pre- and post-TAVI remote ambulatory cardiac monitoring (rACM) strategy for identification of conduction disturbances and to reduce unplanned pre-discharge post-TAVI permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: REdireCT TAVI (NCT0381820) was a prospective cohort study of patients referred for outpatient TAVI. Patients with prior PPMI were excluded. Remote ambulatory cardiac monitoring consisted of 2 weeks of continuous electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring (Pocket-ECGTM) both before and after TAVI. Compliance to monitoring, frequency of notifications, unplanned PPMI post-TAVI, and length of hospitalization were measured. Between June 2018 and March 2020, in 192 undergoing TAVI (mean age: 81.8 years; female sex 46%; balloon-expandable valve 95.3%), compliance to rACM was 91.7% pre-TAVI (mean duration: 12.8 days), and 87.5% post-TAVI (mean duration: 12.9 days). There were 24 (12.5%) rACM notifications (13 pre-TAVI; 11 post-TAVI) resulting in 14 (7.3%) planned PPMI: seven pre-TAVI [due to sinus pauses n = 2 or atrio-ventricular block (AVB) n = 5] and seven post-TAVI [due to sinus pauses n = 1 or AVB n = 5 or ventricular tachycardia (VT) n = 1]. In addition, nine (4.7%) patients received pre-TAVI PPMI due to high-risk baseline ECG (right bundle branch block with hemi-block or prolonged PR interval). Unplanned PPMI post-TAVI during index hospitalization occurred in six (3.1%) patients due to AVB and in one patient readmitted with AVB. The median length of stay post-TAVI was 1 day.
CONCLUSION: A strategy of routine rACM was feasible and frequently led to PPMI. Our approach of 2-week rACM both pre- and post-TAVI achieves both high patient compliance and sufficient surveillance.
