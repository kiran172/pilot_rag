Title: In Vitro Durability and Stability Testing of a Novel Polymeric Transcatheter Aortic Valve.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as an effective therapy for the unmet clinical need of inoperable patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Current clinically used tissue TAVR valves suffer from limited durability that hampers TAVR's rapid expansion to younger, lower risk patients. Polymeric TAVR valves optimized for hemodynamic performance, hemocompatibility, extended durability, and resistance to calcific degeneration offer a viable solution to this challenge. We present extensive in vitro durability and stability testing of a novel polymeric TAVR valve (PolyNova valve) using 1) accelerated wear testing (AWT, ISO 5840); 2) calcification susceptibility (in the AWT)-compared with clinically used tissue valves; and 3) extended crimping stability (valves crimped to 16 Fr for 8 days). Hydrodynamic testing was performed every 50M cycles. The valves were also evaluated visually for structural integrity and by scanning electron microscopy for evaluation of surface damage in the micro-scale. Calcium and phosphorus deposition was evaluated using micro-computed tomography (μCT) and inductive coupled plasma spectroscopy. The valves passed 400M cycles in the AWT without failure. The effective orifice area kept stable at 1.8 cm with a desired gradual decrease in transvalvular pressure gradient and regurgitation (10.4 mm Hg and 6.9%, respectively). Calcium and phosphorus deposition was significantly lower in the polymeric valve: down by a factor of 85 and 16, respectively-as compared to a tissue valve. Following the extended crimping testing, no tears nor surface damage were evident. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of a polymeric TAVR valve to be a viable alternative to tissue-based TAVR valves.
