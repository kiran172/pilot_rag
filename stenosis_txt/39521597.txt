Title: Emerging therapeutics for the management of intestinal fibrosis and strictures.

Abstract: Chronic intestinal inflammation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) can lead to the development of fibrosis and the formation of strictures. Endoscopic balloon dilation and surgical resection are currently the only available treatments for fibrotic strictures. However, both strategies are associated with potential complications and high rates of stricture recurrence, necessitating additional procedures and/or multiple surgical resections. IBD therapeutic modalities aimed at inflammation, including anti-inflammatory agents, such as corticosteroids, biologics and small molecules, have shown limited efficacy in altering the natural history of strictures, ameliorating fibrosis progression, or preventing recurrences. New and innovative therapeutic approaches targeted at fibrosis are urgently needed. Herein, we provide an overview of emerging therapeutics, including novel drug delivery systems, for the management of intestinal fibrosis and strictures.
