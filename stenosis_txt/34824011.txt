Title: Covered Stents vs. Angioplasty for Common Iliac Artery In Stent Restenosis: A Retrospective Comparison.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The optimal endovascular treatment for common iliac artery in stent re-stenosis has yet to be assessed. Treatment options include, among others, angioplasty alone and repeated stenting with covered stents.
METHODS: This study retrospectively compared patency and target lesion revascularisation of these treatments. All patients who underwent endovascular treatment of common iliac artery in stent re-stenosis between 2007 and 2017 were included retrospectively. The primary end point was freedom from re-stenosis. Secondary endpoints were target lesion revascularisation rate (TLR) and freedom from occlusion during follow up.
RESULTS: Seventy-four interventions were included, consisting of 37 angioplasties and 37 covered stent placements in 57 patients. Freedom from re-stenosis at four years was 72.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 51.8% - 88.7%) in the covered stent group vs. 43.5% (95% CI 25.9% - 59.8%) in the percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) group (p = .003). The target lesion revascularisation (TLR) rate was 16.4% (95% CI 7.1% - 35.6%) and 43.6% (95% CI 28.0% - 63.2%) respectively (p = .020). There was no difference in freedom from occlusion; this was 90.8% (95% CI 73.9% - 97.0%) in the covered stent group and 79.1% (95% CI 58.4% - 90.3%) in the PTA group (p = .49). The difference in freedom from re-stenosis and TLR remained significant after sensitivity and multivariable analyses.
CONCLUSION: Covered stents offer better outcomes for common iliac artery in stent re-stenosis than angioplasty alone.
