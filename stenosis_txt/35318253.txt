Title: Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with documented coronary vasospasm during long-term follow-up.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Although recurring coronary artery spasm (CAS) may lead to the development of fixed atherosclerotic coronary stenosis (FS), the relationship between coronary atherosclerosis and CAS is still speculative. We evaluated the incidence of FS requiring percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with documented CAS during long-term follow-up and analysed their clinical features.
METHODS: Clinical data of 3556 patients during a median follow-up of 9.4 years after non-invasive ergonovine spasm provocation testing with echocardiographic monitoring of left ventricular wall motion (erg echo) were analysed.
RESULTS: Erg echo documented CAS in 830 (23.3%) patients, who had higher frequencies of coronary risk factors than those without CAS. Patients with documented CAS on erg echo showed significantly lower 10-year overall (90.5% vs 94.2%, p<0.001) and PCI-free (97.4% vs 98.4%, p=0.002) survival rates than those without CAS. Documented CAS was an independent factor associated with later PCI after adjustment by either Cox regression model or Fine-Gray competing risk model. There was no significant difference in baseline clinical characteristics between patients who needed later PCI and those who did not. Among 28 patients who needed later PCI after documentation of CAS, the original CAS and later PCI territory were concordant in 25 (89.3%), while 3 (10.7%) showed discordance.
CONCLUSIONS: CAS is a risk factor for the development of FS requiring PCI during long-term follow-up, and warrants physicians' vigilance and careful follow-up of patients with documented CAS and insignificant stenosis of major epicardial coronary arteries at the time of initial diagnosis.
