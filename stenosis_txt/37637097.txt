Title: Clinical considerations during spontaneous coronary artery dissection in the post-partum period: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a common and under-recognized cause of myocardial infarction during the post-partum period.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a young women presenting with chest pain in the post-partum period. Her clinical appearance was that of a myocardial infarction, and angiography was indicative of a Type 2 SCAD. The patients had persistent chest pain, reduced left ventricular function, and critical left anterior descending artery stenosis. Percutaneous coronary intervention was done with caution. Shared decision-making with the patient helped guide the medical treatment plan and follow-up.
DISCUSSION: We discuss the clinical considerations surrounding the management of this patient.
