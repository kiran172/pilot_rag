Title: Outcomes of Tubularized Incised Plate Urethroplasty (TIPU) for Hypospadias at Tikur Anbesa Specialized and Menelik II Referral Hospitals: One-year Prospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the results and related factors of tubularized incised plate (TIP) urethroplasty at two institutions.
METHODS: This was a prospective cohort analytical study conducted over a period of 12 months. All patients who underwent TIP urethroplasty in the specified period were studied. Quantitative and qualitative data of the intrinsic parameters of the penis were obtained and patients were followed for an average period of 14.72 ± 3.67 months (range 9-21months) after surgery.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine patients (N = 129) were included in the study. The mean age at surgery was 50.93 months. The mean glans size and pre-incised urethral plate width were 14.34 mm and 8.38mm respectively. The post-operative results were satisfactory with the meatus in a glanular position in 122(94.6%) patients. Overall, 49 patients (38%) developed complications. Eighteen patients (14%) developed early complications whereas forty-two (32.6%) patients had late complications. UCF and Meatal stenosis occurred in 27 (20.9%) & 14 (10.9%) patients respectively. Seven patients developed recurrent hypospadias and dehiscence of glans occurred in eight patients (6.2%).
CONCLUSION: TIP can be used to repair for all types of hypospadias in the absence of severe penile curvature. It has more complication rate in proximal than distal hypospadias. Distal hypospadias were the most common type of hypospadias corrected with TIP. UCF and meatal stenosis were the most common complication followed by glans dehiscence and recurrent hypospadias. Glans size, age at surgery, plate width, location of meatus and stretched penile length were the most determinant factors for the outcome.
