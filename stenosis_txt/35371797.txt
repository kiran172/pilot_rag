Title: Factors Associated With Adverse Outcomes Following Duodenal Atresia Surgery in Neonates: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: Objectives There is limited evidence on the infants' postoperative complications who have undergone surgical repair of duodenal atresia and stenosis. This study aimed to identify the factors associated with poor surgical outcomes after the initial repair. Methods We retrospectively reviewed the data of 82 patients who underwent surgery for duodenal atresia and stenosis between January 1994 and December 2013 at our institution. Gestational age, birth weight, fetal growth, and other associated anomalies were recorded. Multivariate regression analyses were used to identify the factors associated with surgical outcomes, including postoperative complications and time to full oral intake. Results The median gestational age was 37.6 weeks, with 30 (37%) preterm (<37 weeks) and 11 (13%) early preterm (<34 weeks) infants. The median birth weight was 2531 g, with 27 (33%) patients < 2000 g and 10 (12%) patients < 1500 g. Postoperative surgical complications were identified in 18 (22%) cases, of which 12 (15%) required additional operations. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that a combination of very low birth weight (<1500 g) and early preterm was significantly associated with both surgical and non-surgical postoperative complications (p = 0.0028 and 0.021, respectively)Â and a prolonged time to full oral intake postoperatively (p = 0.013). Conclusion Very low birth weight and early preterm were significantly associated with postoperative complications and a prolonged time to full oral intake.
