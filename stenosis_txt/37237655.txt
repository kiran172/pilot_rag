Title: Evaluation of Structural Viability of Porcine Tracheal Scaffolds after 3 and 6 Months of Storage under Three Different Protocols.

Abstract: Tracheal replacement with a bioengineered tracheal substitute has been developed for long-segment tracheal diseases. The decellularized tracheal scaffold is an alternative for cell seeding. It is not defined if the storage scaffold produces changes in the scaffold's biomechanical properties. We tested three protocols for porcine tracheal scaffold preservation immersed in PBS and alcohol 70%, in the fridge and under cryopreservation. Ninety-six porcine tracheas (12 in natura, 84 decellularized) were divided into three groups (PBS, alcohol, and cryopreservation). Twelve tracheas were analyzed after three and six months. The assessment included residual DNA, cytotoxicity, collagen contents, and mechanical properties. Decellularization increased the maximum load and stress in the longitudinal axis and decreased the maximum load in the transverse axis. The decellularization of the porcine trachea produced structurally viable scaffolds, with a preserved collagen matrix suitable for further bioengineering. Despite the cyclic washings, the scaffolds remained cytotoxic. The comparison of the storage protocols (PBS at 4 °C, alcohol at 4 °C, and slow cooling cryopreservation with cryoprotectants) showed no significant differences in the amount of collagen and in the biomechanical properties of the scaffolds. Storage in PBS solution at 4 °C for six months did not change the scaffold mechanics.
