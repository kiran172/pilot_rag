Title: Preoperative Computed Tomographic Angiography Can Predict Need for Branch Pulmonary Artery Intervention in Patients With Ductal-Dependent Pulmonary Blood Flow.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neonates with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow (DD-PBF) are at risk for pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis. The objective of this study was to identify preoperative cardiovascular computed tomography angiography (CTA) measures that are associated with the need for branch PA intervention.
METHODS: We identified neonates with DD-PBF who underwent preoperative CTA at our center and were followed for 24 months. The primary outcome was requiring intervention for branch PA stenosis at the initial or subsequent procedure. Patients were divided into three groups: 1) No PA intervention, 2) Initial PA intervention, and 3) Remote PA intervention. Measurements of the branch PAs and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) were made prospectively.
RESULTS: Forty patients were included, 7 (18%) did not receive a PA intervention, 23 (58%) were in the initial PA intervention group, and 10 (25%) were in the remote PA intervention group. The distance from PA bifurcation to the largest diameter of the PA that receives the PDA showed a difference between the no-intervention group versus the initial and remote intervention groups (0.8 mm [IQR 0.7, 2.0], 8.2 mm [IQR 1.9, 13.7], 8.5 mm [IQR 6.5, 11.1], respectively, P  =  .02). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a distance &gt;2.2 mm had a sensitivity  =  91% and specificity  =  86% in predicting the need for PA intervention.
CONCLUSION: The distance from the PA bifurcation to the largest diameter of the branch PA that accepts the PDA on preoperative CTA is highly predictive of the need for initial or remote PA intervention in this group. Preoperative CTA should be considered for risk stratification in neonates undergoing intervention for DD-PBF.
