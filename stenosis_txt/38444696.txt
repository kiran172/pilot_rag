Title: Successful management of pylorospasm with atropine in a failure-to-thrive neonate case report.

Abstract: Pylorospasm is an elusive diagnosis that can mimic the presentation of pyloric stenosis. There is limited discussion regarding its management in neonates with few case reports describing the use of antispasmodic agents. The following case reviews this management in a unique neonate. A 2-month-old female presented with persistent nonbilious, nonbloody emesis and failure-to-thrive. A thorough workup was performed due to its pronounced persistence while inpatient. Pyloric ultrasounds remained negative for pyloric stenosis; however, an upper gastrointestinal (GI) study was significant for pylorospasm. The workup also revealed hypothyroidism. Antispasmodic therapy with atropine was pursued as she was not a surgical candidate. Patient tolerated IV atropine therapy well with quick resolution of emesis and successfully transitioned to oral atropine therapy, displaying continued weight gain with exclusive oral feeds. This case displays a unique presentation of pylorospasm with successful management utilizing IV and oral atropine therapy in a neonate with failure-to-thrive and concomitant hypothyroidism.
