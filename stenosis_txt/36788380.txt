Title: Impact of Tracheal Arborization and Lung Hypoplasia in Repair of Pulmonary Artery Sling in Combination With Long-Segment Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Background: Reimplantation of the left pulmonary artery (LPA) and slide tracheoplasty has been our standard approach of care for patients with pulmonary artery sling (PAS) and tracheal stenosis. We present our experience, with emphasis on tracheal arborization and hypoplastic lungs; and their impact on long-term outcome of children with PAS and tracheal stenosis. Methods: It is a retrospective comparative study. Data were classified and analyzed based on the type of tracheobronchial arborization and normal versus hypoplastic lungs. Results: Seventy-five children operated between January 1994 and December 2019 (67 with normal lungs and 8 with lung hypoplasia/agenesis) were included. Patients with hypoplastic lungs had higher rates of preoperative ventilation (87.5%), postoperative ventilation (10 vs 8 days, P = .621), and mortality (50% vs 9%, P = .009) compared with those with normal lungs. Nineteen patients had tracheal bronchus (TB) variety and 30 patients had congenital long-segment tracheal stenosis (CLSTS) variety of tracheobronchial arborization. Endoscopic intervention was needed in 47.4% of patients with TB type and 60% with CLSTS type. CLSTS patients had higher rates of preoperative ventilation (60% vs 47.4%, P = .386), longer periods of postoperative ventilation (13 vs 6.5 days, P = .006), and ICU stay (15 vs 11 days, P = .714) compared with TB type. Conclusion: Surgical repair of PAS with tracheal stenosis has good long-term outcomes. All variations of tracheal anatomy can be managed with slide tracheoplasty. Persistence of airway problems requires intervention during follow-up as tracheal stenosis continues to be the Achilles heel.
