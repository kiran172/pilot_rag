Title: Low bone mass is associated with carotid calcification plaque in Chinese postmenopausal women: the Chongqing osteoporosis study.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between low bone mass and the risk of carotid calcification plaques in Chinese postmenopausal women.Methods: We conducted a 5â€‰years prospective study. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scanning. Carotid computed tomography angiography (CTA) was conducted using a 64-multidetector row scanner to assess carotid arterial plaque at baseline and during follow-up. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to evaluate the association of BMD and risk of carotid calcification plaques.Results: Four hundred and eighty-eight women sustained prospective carotid plaques during the follow-up. Women with carotid calcification plaques had low BMD than those with carotid non-calcification plaques. After adjustment for potential confounders, BMD, age, years since menopause, levels of plasma osteoprotegerin and adiponectin, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia were independently associated with increased risk of carotid calcification plaques. For carotid calcification plaques, a significant inverse correlation was indicated between BMD and the plaques, and a significant positive correlation was indicated between bone loss and plaques.Conclusions: This study suggested that lower BMD and increased loss rate of BMD were associated with a higher risk of carotid calcification plaques in Chinese postmenopausal women.
