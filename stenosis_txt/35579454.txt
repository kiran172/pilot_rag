Title: Intravenous iron supplement for iron deficiency in patients with severe aortic stenosis scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation: results of the IIISAS randomised trial.

Abstract: AIMS: The aim of this trial was to evaluate whether intravenous iron could provide benefit beyond transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in iron-deficient patients with severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single-centre trial, we enrolled patients with severe aortic stenosis and iron deficiency (defined as ferritin <100 µg/L, or 100-299 µg/L with a transferrin saturation <20%) who were evaluated for TAVI. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive intravenous ferric derisomaltose or placebo ∼3 months before TAVI. The primary endpoint was the between-group, baseline-adjusted 6-min walk distance measured 3 months after TAVI. Secondary outcomes included quality of life, iron stores, hand grip strength, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, and safety. Between January 2020 and September 2021, we randomised 74 patients to ferric derisomaltose and 75 patients to placebo. The modified intention-to-treat population comprised the 104 patients who completed the 6-min walk test at baseline and 3 months after successful TAVI. Iron stores were restored in 76% of the patients allocated to iron and 13% of the patients allocated to placebo (p < 0.001). There was no difference in the baseline-adjusted 6-min walk distance between the two treatment arms (p = 0.82). The number of serious adverse events, quality of life, hand grip strength, and NYHA class did not differ between the treatment arms.
CONCLUSION: Treatment with intravenous iron did not provide clinical benefit beyond TAVI in iron-deficient patients with severe aortic stenosis.
