Title: The rationale of using cerebral embolic protection devices during transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis is one of the most common valvular abnormalities, which can manifest as angina, syncope, dyspnoea and sudden cardiac death. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been introduced as an alternative to surgical valve replacement in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis, resulting in less morbidity, shorter time to recovery and similar mortality rates. Progress in this field has reduced complication rates. However, the incidence of peri-procedural stroke remains relatively high (around 4%). To fully utilise the potential of TAVI, cerebral embolic protection devices (CEPD) have been developed and introduced. In this position paper, we aim to summarise the available data on several CEPD.
