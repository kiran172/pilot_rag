Title: Anatomical classification and clinical outcomes of biliary strictures in living donor liver transplantation using right liver grafts.

Abstract: This study aimed to classify the anatomical types of biliary strictures, including intrahepatic biliary stricture (IHBS), after living donor liver transplantations (LDLTs) using right liver grafts and evaluate their prognosis. Among 692 adult patients who underwent right liver LDLT, 198 recipients with biliary strictures (28.6%) were retrospectively reviewed. Based on data obtained during the first cholangiography, the patients' biliary strictures were classified into the following three types according to the levels and number of branches involved: Types 1 (anastomosis), 2 (second-order branch [a, one; b, two or more; c, extended to the third-order branch]), and 3 (whole graft [a, multifocal strictures; b, diffuse necrosis]). IHBS was defined as a nonanastomotic stricture. Among the 198 recipients with biliary strictures, the IHBS incidence rates were 38.4% ( n = 76). The most common type of IHBS was 2c ( n = 43, 56.6%), whereas Type 3 ( n = 10, 13.2%) was uncommon. The intervention frequency per year significantly differed among the types (Type 1, 2.3; Type 2a, 2.3; Type 2b, 2.8; Type 2c, 4.3; and Type 3, 7.2; p  < 0.001). The intervention-free period for more than 1 year, which was as follows, also differed among the types: Type 1, 84.4%; Type 2a, 87.5%; Type 2b, 86.7%; Type 2c, 72.1%; and Type 3, 50.0% ( p = 0.048). The graft survival rates of Type 3 (80.0%) were significantly lower than those of the other types ( p = 0.001). IHBSs are relatively common in right liver LDLTs. Although Type 3 IHBSs are rare, they require more intensive care and are associated with poorer graft survival rates than anastomosis strictures and Type 2 IHBS.
