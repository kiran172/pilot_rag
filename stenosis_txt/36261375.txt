Title: Chronic Expanding Haematoma Causing Stenosis of the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract and Pulmonary Hypertension.

Abstract: A chronic expanding haematoma (CEH) is an encapsulated mass that gradually increases in size from repeated internal bleeding and neovascularization. We herein report a 69-year-old man who was admitted with dyspnoea on exertion after undergoing thymic carcinoma resection 17 years ago. Chest computed tomography showed a heterogeneous mass in the anterior mediastinum and compression of the right ventricle, and pulmonary artery. Right cardiac catheterisation revealed pulmonary hypertension that was relieved after resection of the diagnosed CEH mass. This report highlights the mechanism underlying anterior mediastinal CEH-induced stenotic compression of the right ventricle-pulmonary artery outflow and subsequent pulmonary hypertension.
