Title: The "Wrinkle Sign" in Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Venography is a Hallmark of Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is usually caused by sinus stenosis, which manifests in magnetic resonance venography (MRV) as occlusion or intraluminal webbing. We present the case of a 27-year-old patient with IIH, and time-of-flight (TOF) MRV only exhibited a rare "wrinkle sign," which was eventually proved to indicate sinus obstruction. The patient received venting and recovered. The TOF MRV provides a nonradioactive approach to identify IIH patients who potentially need intervention.
