Title: Results of new-generation self-expanding transcatheter Porticoтм valve implantation in patients with degenerative aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Aim    To evaluate 30-day results of the transcatheter correction of degenerative aortic stenosis using a novel self-expandable valve, PorticoTM.Material and methods    Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was performed in 42 patients with an intermediate surgical risk (mean age, 74.3±6.5 years, 8 men, 34 women, EuroSCORE II risk, 2.5 (1.5;4.1)) with severe degenerative aortic stenosis (AS). 20 (48 %) patients had ischemic heart disease; 8 (19%) of patients had atrial fibrillation, and 16 (38%) of patients had type 2 diabetes mellitus. Most of the patients (88 %) had preserved systolic function, and 5 patients had a pronounced decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction. Early efficacy and safety of the intervention were evaluated with VARC-2 criteria.Results    In-hospital and 30-day mortality following TAVI was absent. Also, there were no adverse events, including cerebrovascular disorders, perioperative myocardial infarction, and conversion to open surgery. One patient had prosthesis migration to the aorta, which required implantation of the second self-expandable valve. Mean duration of the procedure was 90 min (80;110), fluoroscopy time was 21 min (19;24), and contrast volume 154 ml (200;240). Following TAVI, the mean aortic valve (AV) pressure gradient significantly decreased from 56.1±21.2 to 11.2±4.0 mm Hg, the maximal gradient decreased from 88.9±27.8 to 20.0±7.0 mm Hg, and the AV effective orifice area increased from 0.67±0.2 to 1.9±0.3 cm2 (p&lt;0.001). By the time of discharge from the hospital, all patients showed regression of AS clinical manifestations. The percentage of patients with NYHA functional class III chronic heart failure reduced from 62 % to 7 % (p&lt;0.001) after TAVI. In one case after the implantation, grade 3 aortic regurgitation was observed, which required endovascular occlusion to close the paraprosthetic fistula. Moderate paraprosthetic regurgitation (grade &lt;2) was observed in 3 (7 %) patients. Only 2 (4.8%) patients required permanent pacemaker implantation.Conclusion    Results of the single-center prospective TAVI study using a novel self-expandable valve Porticoтм showed satisfactory hemodynamic parameters, efficacy and safety of the procedure for the 30-day follow-up period. A relatively low radial force of the carcass can be beneficial for reducing the incidence of permanent pacemaker implantation after TAVI.
