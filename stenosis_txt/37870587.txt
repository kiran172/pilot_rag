Title: Association Between Polyvascular Disease and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Outcomes: Insights From the STS/ACC TVT Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is highly prevalent in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Polyvascular disease (PVD), defined as involvement of ≥2 vascular beds (VBs), that is, coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral, portends a poor prognosis in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; however, data on the association of PVD with outcomes of patients undergoing TAVR are limited.
METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons and the American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry was analyzed to identify patients who underwent TAVR from November 2011 to March 2022. The exposure of interest was PVD. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included major vascular complications, major/life-threatening bleeding, myocardial infarction, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and valve- and non-valve-related readmissions. Outcomes were assessed at 30 days and 1 year.
RESULTS: Of 443 790 patients who underwent TAVR, PVD was present in 150 823 (34.0%; 111 425 [25.1%] with 2VB-PVD and 39 398 [8.9%] with 3VB-PVD). On multivariable analysis, PVD was associated with increased all-cause mortality at 1 year (hazard ratio, 1.17 [95% CI, 1.14-1.20]). There was an incremental increase in 1-year mortality with an increasing number of VBs involved (no PVD [reference]; 2VB-PVD: hazard ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.09-1.15]: and 3VB-PVD: hazard ratio, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.26-1.36]). Patients with versus without PVD had higher rates of major vascular complications, major/life-threatening bleeding, transient ischemic attack/stroke, and non-valve-related readmissions at 30 days and 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: PVD is associated with worse outcomes after TAVR, and the risk is highest in patients with 3VB-PVD.
