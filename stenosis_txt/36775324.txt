Title: [A case of secondary sclerosing cholangitis following endoscopic submucosal dissection ulcer bleeding].

Abstract: A 75-year-old male patient underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric cancer. The ESD ulcer bleeding occurred 7 days post-ESD, and he underwent endoscopic clipping hemostasis. Afterward, the patient presented with acute cholecystitis and cholangitis, thereby developing sclerosing cholangitis. His hepatic failure worsened and he died 15 months post-ESD although we performed endoscopic dilations for bile duct stenosis and administered antibiotics. We considered the condition to be related to secondary sclerosing cholangitis in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) caused by bile duct ischemia and cholangitis.
