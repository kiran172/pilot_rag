Title: Erratum: A TNBS-Induced Rodent Model to Study the Pathogenic Role of Mechanical Stress in Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: An erratum was issued for: A TNBS-Induced Rodent Model to Study the Pathogenic Role of Mechanical Stress in Crohn's Disease. The Introduction and Protocol were updated. The first sentence of the Introduction was updated from: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract affecting approximately 20 per 1,00,000 in Europe and USA. CD is characterized by transmural inflammation, intestinal fibrosis, and luminal stenosis. to: Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as Crohn's disease (CD) are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract affecting approximately 20 per 1,000,000 in Europe and USA. CD is characterized by transmural inflammation, intestinal fibrosis, and luminal stenosis. Step 1.3 in the Protocol was updated from: Prepare fresh TNBS solution according to body weights. NOTE: TNBS - 65 mg/kg of body weight in 250 µL of 40% ethanol was used. to: Prepare fresh TNBS solution according to body weights.
