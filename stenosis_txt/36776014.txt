Title: [Clinical experience of REcanalisation and balloon-oriented puncture for Re-insertion of long- term dialysis catheter in nonpatent central veins].

Abstract: It is difficult to insert long-term dialysis catheters after severe stenosis or occlusion of the internal jugular vein and innominate vein. We used REcanalisation and balloon-oriented puncture for Re-insertion of dialysis catheter in nonpatent central veins (REBORN) in seven patients with severe central venous lesions, and all patients were inserted with long-term dialysis catheters successfully. None had severe complications such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pulmonary embolism during operation. All catheters functioned well after postoperative follow-up of 2 months. REBORN provides a novel approach to establish difficult dialysis pathways.
