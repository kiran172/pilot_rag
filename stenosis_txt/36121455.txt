Title: The Gordian knot of hydrocephalus: constrictive entanglement of distal ventriculoperitoneal shunt catheter.

Abstract: We recently cared for a patient with a distal ventriculoperitoneal shunt malfunction. The peritoneal catheter was coiled in a scarred pseudocyst, and we encountered strong resistance while attempting to remove the distal shunt catheter. The catheter was successfully removed under laparoscopic guidance and was found to be tightly coiled in a constrictive knot. We describe a technique for managing this unusual presentation to minimize the risk of complications.
