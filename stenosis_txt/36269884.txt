Title: Comparison of MANTA vs ProGlide Vascular Closure Device and 30-Day Outcomes in Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vascular complications (VCs) after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) have an increased mortality risk, and vascular closure device (VCD) use is mandatory. The percutaneous MANTA VCD (Teleflex) is a novel collagen-based technology for closure of large-bore arteriotomies. We compared the MANTA VCD with the suture-based ProGlide VCD (Abbott Vascular).
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed on all consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI in our center from January 1, 2015, to February 28, 2021, and 30-day outcomes were recorded. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were cardiac death, disabling stroke, and/or major VCs. Access site-related VCs were VCs related to the access site vessel from which the transcatheter valve was introduced and advanced.
RESULTS: The MANTA VCD was used in 99 patients and the ProGlide in 224. There was 4.0% MACE in the MANTA group and 4.9% in the ProGlide group (P = .999). Overall VCs were 10.1% vs 7.6%, major VCs were 3.0% vs 2.2%, and minor VCs 7.1% vs 5.4%(P = .753). Access site-related VCs were 5.1% vs 5.8% in the (P = .999), and periprocedural vascular surgical intervention was needed in 6.1% of the MANTA group vs 2.2% of the ProGlide group (P = .099).
CONCLUSION: There was no significant difference in MACE, mortality, cardiovascular mortality, VCs, access site-related VCs, periprocedural vascular surgical interventions, bleeding, or transfusion rate between the 2 groups. The MANTA VCD group had more periprocedural vascular surgical interventions which did not reach statistical significance.
