Title: Aortic Valve-Sparing Surgical Treatment of Supravalvar Aortic Stenosis in a 65-Year-Old Adult.

Abstract: Supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a rare congenital cardiac disease that usually co-occurs with Williams syndrome. In the adult population, a few SVAS cases have been reported in patients affected by homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. However, because of the rarity of this disease entity, there is no standard surgical treatment for SVAS. Here, we present a case of successful surgical treatment using an autologous excised aortic patch in a 65-year-old patient with SVAS.
