Title: Quantifying Carotid Stenosis: History, Current Applications, Limitations, and Potential: How Imaging Is Changing the Scenario.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. The journey to understanding carotid disease has developed over time and radiology has a pivotal role in diagnosis, risk stratification and therapeutic management. This paper reviews the history of diagnostic imaging in carotid disease, its evolution towards its current applications in the clinical and research fields, and the potential of new technologies to aid clinicians in identifying the disease and tailoring medical and surgical treatment.
