Title: Utility of a Mechanical Thrombectomy Device in Treating Calcified Instent Restenosis Post Iliofemoral Venous Stenting.

Abstract: Instent restenosis (ISR) following iliofemoral venous stenting is quite common with up to three-quarters of patients developing some degree of ISR. However, only around 16% develop recurrent symptoms impairing their quality-of-life meriting reintervention. The first line of treatment for such ISR involves the use of angioplasty balloons to recreate an adequate flow channel. At times such angioplasty alone is inadequate particularly in the presence of calcified ISR. It is in this setting that the authors decided to explore the utility of a mechanical thrombectomy device to debulk the ISR and thereby help create an adequate flow channel. The successful utilization of such a device in a patient presenting with recurrent, disabling, quality of life impairing symptoms due to ISR represents the focus of this report.
