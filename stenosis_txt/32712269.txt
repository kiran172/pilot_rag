Title: Systolic overload-induced pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, oxidative stress and heart failure progression through interleukin-1β.

Abstract: Chronic heart failure is associated with increased interleukin-1β (IL-1β), leukocyte infiltration, and fibrosis in the heart and lungs. Here we further studied the role of IL-1β in the transition from left heart failure to pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy in mice with existing left heart failure produced by transverse aortic constriction. We demonstrated that transverse aortic constriction-induced heart failure was associated with increased lung inflammation and cleaved IL-1β, and inhibition of IL-1β signaling using blocking antibodies of clone B122 effectively attenuated further decrease of left ventricular systolic function in mice with existing heart failure. We found that inhibition of IL-1β attenuated lung inflammation, inflammasome activation, fibrosis, oxidative stress, and right ventricular hypertrophy. IL-1β blocking antibodies of clone B122 also significantly attenuated lung T cell activation. Together, these data indicate that IL-1β signaling exerts a causal role for heart failure progression, or the transition from left heart failure to lung remodeling and right heart hypertrophy.
