Title: The jugular-subclavian junction and venous drainage of the brain.

Abstract: Lung cancers and mediastinal masses can invade the veins in the upper mediastinum and neck. It can be challenging to determine management options and the feasibility of resection particularly when tumors involve the major venous junctions. Furthermore, impaired flow in these veins can have devastating complications such as Paget-Schroetter syndrome, which describes a constellation of symptoms (arm swelling, cyanosis, pain) due to stenosis of the subclavian vein. This section will provide an overview of venous drainage of the brain, which can be divided into two major systems-superficial medullary venous system and deep medullary venous system. The anatomy and function of the great veins of the neck and upper mediastinum, including the internal jugular vein, subclavian vein, and brachiocephalic (i.e., innominate) vein will be described. Also discussed will be principles of ligation of the venous structures and the importance of keeping the venous junctions intact to facilitate and maximize the development of collateral flow. This section will also discuss ensuing complications when blood flow is impaired, such as development of upper extremity deep venous thrombosis and cerebral venous thrombosis (CVT). CVT can result in a stroke and is an umbrella term that refers to problems in cerebral venous outflow due to numerous etiologies.
