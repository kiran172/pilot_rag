Title: Spinal cord ischemia following laryngotracheal reconstruction surgery: a case report.

Abstract: We present a 20-year-old patient with subglottic and tracheal stenosis was taken for a tracheal resection and end-to-end anastomosis. The patient's neck was positioned in hyperflexion using chin stitches to minimize tension at the anastomosis. On post-operative period, the patient developed paresthesias in upper and lower extremities associated with motor weakness. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed showing lesions compromising ventral spinal cord at the level of C4-C5 and C6-C7. Chin stitches were removed and neck flexion was reduced. The patient remained in the intensive care unit with vasopressors, physical therapy and intravenous fluid-therapy to maintain mean arterial pressure above 90 mmHg. After 3 weeks, the patient was discharged with no neurologic deficit. There are few cases reported of acute ischemic spinal injury following tracheal reconstruction. If this complication arises, neck posture should be corrected, maintenance of MAP above 90 mmHg and implementation of early physical therapy is key to improve neurologic outcomes.
