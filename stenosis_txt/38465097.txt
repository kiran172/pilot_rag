Title: Carotid Free-Floating Thrombus Treated With a Combined Technique Using Embotrap III for Distal Protection.

Abstract: Carotid free-floating thrombus (FFT) is a rare condition in patients with acute ischemic stroke. Recently, endovascular therapy for carotid FFT has been increasingly reported, but the strategy has not yet been established. We report a case of an acute stroke patient with a carotid FFT, who was successfully treated with a combination of the direct aspiration first-pass technique (ADAPT) and the Embotrap III (Cerenovus, Irvine, CA), specifically designed to prevent distal embolization. We propose the utility of distal embolic protection with Embotrap III for the treatment of patients with carotid FFT. A 71-year-old man who presented with sudden left hemiparesis was admitted to our hospital. Ultrasonography on admission revealed severe stenosis and an FFT at the origin of the right internal carotid artery. Thrombectomy with an aspiration catheter, accompanied by a stent retriever with distal basket Embotrap III for distal protection, was performed. After the FFT was safely aspirated, a carotid Wallstent (Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA) was deployed in the stenosis. Follow-up ultrasonography showed neither FFT nor in-stent protrusion. The patient did not experience recurrence, as per clinical or radiological findings, and was discharged on day 11 without any neurological deficits. Embotrap III may be useful for a patient with a carotid FFT as distal protection during mechanical thrombectomies.
