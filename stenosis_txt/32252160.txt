Title: Telerobotic Spinal Surgery Based on 5G Network: The First 12 Cases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy and feasibility of 5th generation wireless systems (5G) telerobotic spinal surgery in our first 12 cases.
METHODS: A total of 12 patients (5 males, 7 females; age, 23-71 years) with spinal disorders (4 thoracolumbar fractures, 6 lumbar spondylolisthesis, 2 lumbar stenosis) were treated with 5G telerobotic spinal surgery. Sixty-two pedicle screws were implanted.
RESULTS: All patients had substantial relief from their symptoms. Screw placements were classified using Gertzbein-Robbins criteria. There were 59 grade A, 3 grade B. Mean operation time was 142.5 ± 46.7 minutes. Mean guiding wire insertion time was 41.3 ± 9.8 minutes. The deviation between the planned and actual positions was 0.76 ± 0.49 mm. No intraoperative adverse event was found.
CONCLUSION: 5G remote robot-assisted spinal surgery is accurate and reliable. We conclude that 5G telerobotic spinal surgery is both efficacious and feasible for the management of spinal diseases with safety.
