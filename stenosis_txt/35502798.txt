Title: Functional Versus Anatomical Nasolacrimal Obstruction: Are There Differences in Epiphora Severity, Symptoms, or Effects on Quality of Life?

Abstract: PURPOSE: To elucidate whether the specific cause of nasolacrimal duct drainage impairment impacts the severity, symptoms, and implications on visual tasks and quality of life (QOL) in epiphora.
METHODS: A retrospective review of consecutive adult patients with epiphora attending a tertiary lacrimal clinic from June 2011 to March 2021 was conducted. Cases with evidence of canalicular stenosis, a mucocele, or other identifiable causes of epiphora were excluded. A structured interview assessed the epiphora severity (Munk), symptomatology, precipitating factors, and effects on visual tasks and QOL. Following lacrimal syringing, all eyes were investigated with dacryocystography and dacryoscintigraphy. The domains of the interview were compared between nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), stenosis (NLDS), and nonanatomical functional delay (FNLDO).
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two symptomatic eyes (63 patients; mean age 63.3 ± 17.2 years; 59% females) were included. There was no difference in Munk score between the groups (NLDO = 3.71 ± 0.18, NLDS = 3.79 ± 2.0, FNLDO = 3.85 ± 0.15; p = 0.82). In all 3 groups, most cases had a Munk >2 (86.8%, 75.9%, and 89.1%, respectively; p = 0.25). Discharge was more common in NLDO (65.7%) compared with NLDS (30.0%) and FNLDO (36.4%, p = 0.006). Worsening in the cold/wind was more frequent in FNLDO (77.1%) compared with NLDO (48.5%, p = 0.029). Effects on visual tasks and QOL were not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: FNLDO patients experience a high severity of epiphora, comparable to patients with NLDS and those with complete NLDO. The distinction between FNLDO and NLDS had little consequence on reported symptoms, precipitating factors, visual tasks, and QOL. Discharge may be more specific to NLDO, whereas precipitating cold or wind is more specific to FNLDO.
