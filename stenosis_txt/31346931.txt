Title: Functional Lumen Imaging Probe Is Useful for the Quantification of Gastric Sleeve Stenosis and Prediction of Response to Endoscopic Dilation: a Pilot Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stenosis after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) is common though diagnostic criteria and predictors of treatment response is unknown. Endoluminal functional impedance planimetry (EndoFLIP) is a diagnostic tool for measuring lumen geometry. We aimed to use EndoFLIP to characterize SG stenosis.
METHODS: We enrolled SG stenosis patients undergoing serial pneumatic dilations between May 2018 and November 2018. Outcomes of interest included pre- and post-dilation EndoFLIP measurements and post-dilation symptom response.
RESULTS: We included 10 patients who underwent a mean of 1.8 ± 0.7 dilations. Pre-dilation EndoFLIP characteristics were similar for responders and non-responders. Responders had larger mean post-dilation diameter (19.9 ± 2.9 mm vs 13.1 ± 1.3 mm, p = 0.007) and DI (21.3 ± 1.0 mm2/Hg vs 4.0 ± 5.4 mm2/Hg, p = 0.04) than non-responders.
CONCLUSION: Our pilot study supports the use of EndoFLIP in the management of SG stenosis.
