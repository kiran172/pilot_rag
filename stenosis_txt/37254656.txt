Title: Clinical Outcomes of Open-Door Laminoplasty Combined with Bilateral Lateral Mass Screw Fixation for Multi-Level Cervical Spinal Stenosis with Traumatic Cervical Instability and Spinal Cord Injury: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The prevalence of multi-level cervical spinal stenosis complicated with traumatic cervical instability and spinal cord injury (MCSS-TCISCI) is low, and the optimal surgical approach remains unclear. Open-door laminoplasty combined with bilateral lateral mass screw fixation (ODL-BLMSF) is a relatively new surgical technique; however, its clinical effectiveness in managing MCSS-TCISCI has not been well-established. This study aims to assess the clinical value of ODL-BLMSF against MCSS-TCISCI.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 20 cases of MCSS-TCISCI treated with ODL-BLMSF from July 2016 to June 2020. Radiographic alterations of all included patients were measured using plain radiographs, CT scans, and MRI scans. Cervical lordosis was evaluated using C2-C7 Cobb angle and cervical curvature index (CCI) on lateral radiographs, and Pavlov ratio at the C5 level. Neurological functional recovery was assessed using Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores and Nurick grade, while neck and axial symptoms were assessed using the neck disability index (NDI) and the visual analog scale (VAS). The paired t-test was utilized for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: All included patients were followed up for an average period of 26.5 months (range: 24-30 months) after ODL-BLMSF. The average Pavlov ratio at the C5 level significantly improved from 0.57 ± 0.1 preoperatively to 1.13 ± 0.1 and 1.12 ± 0.04 at 6 months postoperatively and at the last follow-up (t = 16.347, 16.536, p < 0.001). Importantly, this approach significantly increased the JOA score from 5.0 ± 2.6 before surgery to 11.65 ± 4.3 and 12.1 ± 4.3 at 6 months postoperatively and at the last follow-up (t = 9.6, -9.600, p < 0.001), with an average JOA recovery rate of 59.1%; and the average Nurick disability score decreased from 3.0 ± 1.3 (preoperative) to 1.65 ± 1.22 and 1.5 ± 1.2 (6 months postoperatively and at last follow-up) (t = 5.111, 1.831, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the NDI score decreased from 30.3 ± 4.3 preoperatively to 13.2 ± 9.2 at 6 months (t = 12.305, p < 0.001), and to 12.45 ± 8.6 at the final follow-up (t = 13.968, p < 0.001), while the VAS score decreased from 4.0 ± 1.5 preoperatively to 1.5 ± 0.7 at 6 months (t = 9.575, p < 0.001), and to 1.15 ± 0.7 at the final follow-up (t = 10.356, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: ODL-BLMSF can effectively dilate the stenotic spinal canal to decompress the spinal cord, maintain good cervical alignment and stability, and improve the recovery of neurological function and neck function. This technique is suitable for treating selected cases of MCSS-TCISCI.
