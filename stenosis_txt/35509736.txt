Title: Complete Currarino Triad Presenting With Chronic Constipation.

Abstract: Currarino syndrome (CS) is a congenital disorder that is characterized by the triad of anorectal malformation, sacrococcygeal anomalies, and a presacral mass. The inheritance of CS is autosomal dominant. Chronic constipation is the most common symptom of CS. MRI is considered the most sensitive test to diagnose CS. The report describes an eight-month-old baby girl who presented with chronic constipation. Physical examination showed abdominal distension and anal stenosis. Plain radiographs and MRI revealed sacrococcygeal abnormalities with a presacral mass. A patient was diagnosed with Currarino syndrome and managed surgically with excision of the presacral mass and an anorectoplasty via a posterior sagittal midline incision.
