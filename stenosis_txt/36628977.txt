Title: Evidence of Carotid Atherosclerosis Vulnerability Regression in Real Life From Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Results of the MAGNETIC Prospective Study.

Abstract: Background Atherosclerosis vulnerability regression has been evidenced mostly in randomized clinical trials with intensive lipid-lowering therapy. We aimed to demonstrate vulnerability regression in real life, with a comprehensive quantitative method, in patients with asymptomatic mild to moderate carotid atherosclerosis on a secondary prevention program. Methods and Results We conducted a single-center prospective observational study (MAGNETIC [Magnetic Resonance Imaging as a Gold Standard for Noninvasive Evaluation of Atherosclerotic Involvement of Carotid Arteries]): 260 patients enrolled at a cardiac rehabilitation center were followed for 3 years with serial magnetic resonance imaging. Per section cutoffs (95th/5th percentiles) were derived from a sample of 20 consecutive magnetic resonance imaging scans: (1) lipid-rich necrotic core: 26% of vessel wall area; (2) intraplaque hemorrhage: 12% of vessel wall area; and (3) fibrous cap: (a) minimum thickness: 0.06 mm, (b) mean thickness: 0.4 mm, (c) projection length: 11 mm. Patients with baseline magnetic resonance imaging of adequate quality (n=247) were classified as high (n=63, 26%), intermediate (n=65, 26%), or low risk (n=119, 48%), if vulnerability criteria were fulfilled in ≥2 contiguous sections, in 1 or multiple noncontiguous sections, or in any section, respectively. Among high-risk patients, a conversion to any lower-risk status was found in 11 (17%; P=0.614) at 6 months, in 16 (25%; P=0.197) at 1 year, and in 19 (30%; P=0.009) at 3 years. Among patients showing any degree of carotid plaque vulnerability, 21 (16%; P=0.014) were diagnosed at low risk at 3 years. Conclusions This study demonstrates with a quantitative approach that vulnerability regression is common in real life. A secondary prevention program can promote vulnerability regression in asymptomatic patients in the mid to long term.
