Title: One-stage thyroid cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction for children less than one year old with congenital subglottic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate one-stage thyroid cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction in children less than one year of age with congenital subglottic stenosis.
METHODS: Congenital subglottic stenosis children less than one year old who underwent one-stage thyroid cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction between 2016 and 2020 in our department were retrospectively reviewed. Their clinical characteristics, treatments and prognoses were assessed.
RESULTS: Eleven congenital subglottic stenosis children (6-11 months) were included: seven with Myer-Cotton grade II, and four with Myer-Cotton grade III. Their tracheal diameters were corrected to normal size using thyroid cartilage, and they were intubated under sedation for two weeks after surgery. Moreover, all of them received anti-infection and anti-reflux therapies during hospitalisation. No breathing difficulty, aspiration, hoarseness or laryngitis was observed during the follow-up period (10-30 months), and their growth and development were age appropriate.
CONCLUSION: The one-stage thyroid cartilage laryngotracheal reconstruction is a good treatment option for congenital subglottic stenosis children less than one year old with Myer-Cotton grade II-III.
