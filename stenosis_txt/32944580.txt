Title: "Crown of Death"; Corona Mortis, a Common Vascular Variant in Pelvis: Identification at Routine 64-Slice CT-Angiography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To establish the incidence of arterial corona mortis variant in angiographic studies being performed using a 64 slice CT scan machine in a series of patients.
METHODS: This was a prospective cross-sectional study including 100 consecutive patients undergoing routine clinically indicated, standard protocol, CT-angiography for the abdominal aorta and/or lower limbs using a 64 slice CT scanner. Patients having severe arterial insufficiency (Grade 4 stenosis on CT angiography), pelvic infections and tumours, patients with past pelvic trauma and those who had previous pelvic surgery were excluded from the study. In total 200 hemi-pelvises were evaluated for the presence or absence of corona morti.
RESULTS: Overall, we included 100 patients in this series including 67 men and 33 women with mean age of 40.1Â±2.3 (ranging from 22-74) years. The arterial variant was identified on thin, 0.625-mm-thick images in 24 out of 100 patients studied (unilateral in 20 patients and bilateral in 4 patients; 28 out of 200 hemipelvises evaluated, having an incidence of 14%). We found that the distance of corona mortis artery from the symphysis was significantly greater for women compared to men, both on right (p=0.034) and left sides (p=0.046).
CONCLUSION: Corona mortis may be prospectively identified at contrast-enhanced multidetector CT especially in pelvic trauma patients and help guide subsequent endovascular embolization or surgical interventions.
