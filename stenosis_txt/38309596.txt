Title: Incidence of Ureteroenteric Anastomotic Strictures After Robotic vs Open Cystectomy in Adults.

Abstract: To synthesise the evidence comparing the incidence rates of UAS post-RARC vs Open Radical cystectomy (ORC) in adults undergoing cystectomy and to compare differential stricture rates between Extracorporeal and Intracorporeal urinary diversion (ECUD vs ICUD). The primary outcome was incidence rate of UAS post RARC vs ORC and the secondary outcome was incidence rate of UAS in RARC post ECUD vs ICUD. Review authors conducted comprehensive search for studies comparing RARC with ORC in terms of incidence of UAS. Furthermore, we conducted a secondary search for studies which compared UAS incidence comparing ECUD and ICUD. We found that RARC may have higher incidence of UAS [OR: 1.39; 95% CI 1.11-1.75; p < 0.0001]. ECUD may result in lower rate of UAS as compared to ICUD [OR: 0.74; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.98; p= 0.04].
