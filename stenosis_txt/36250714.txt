Title: Intracranial vascular stenosis in giant cell arteritis successfully treated by two balloon angioplasty procedures.

Abstract: Intracranial vascular stenosis is rarely associated with giant cell arteritis (GCA), and the prognosis for stroke caused by GCA is poor. Despite its unfavourable outcome, the strategy to manage this involvement and the indication of endovascular treatment are not well defined in the latest guidelines or recommendations. Here, we present a case in a 68-year-old woman, which was refractory to medical therapy, but successfully treated by two balloon angioplasty procedures. She was admitted to our department with lower extremity stiffness and left visual disturbance. GCA was clinically diagnosed by the wall thickening of the temporal artery and the aorta. Hemiparesis and motor aphasia developed shortly after intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed acute cerebral infarction with severe stenosis at the end of the left internal carotid artery. Balloon angioplasty was tried initially with improvement in her symptoms and additionally performed to treat restenosis without any significant adverse events. Her symptoms markedly improved with no recurrence until 8â€‰months after discharge. We also review 10 similar cases reported in the literature. Although further evidence is needed to confirm the usefulness and safety of balloon angioplasty for intracranial GCA, this case report provides valuable information about the endovascular therapy for GCA.
