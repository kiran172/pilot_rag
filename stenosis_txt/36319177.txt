Title: [Application expansion of unilateral biportal endoscopy in spine surgery and its related issues].

Abstract: At the beginning of clinical application, unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) was mainly applied to lumbar degenerative diseases, and lumbar disc herniation or lumbar spinal stenosis accounted for the majority. With the improvement of technology and equipment, the range of diseases being treated continues to expand, and the indications are extended to cervical and thoracic spinal decompression, and it can also be used in conjunction with minimally invasive techniques such as percutaneous pedicle screws and oblique lumbar interbody fusion, which plays an important role in lumbar interbody fusion. However, the development of unilateral biportal endoscopic technology is still in its initial stage in China and has not been widely applied. There are still relevant issues that need to be clarified and further studied. Therefore, this paper discusses the technical superiority, the application expansion and the shortcomings of UBE technique and related issues.
