Title: Building block osteotomy, a new back muscle-preserving laminoplasty for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: In order to preserve paravertebral muscles and posterior ligaments complex (PLC), this paper proposes a new lumbar laminoplasty surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). According to the anatomy of back muscles insertions, building block osteotomy (BBO) which aimed to achieve precise osteotomy and reconstruction based on modular design theory was firstly put forward, and supposed to be achieved by an ultrasound bone scalpel (UBS). In details, lumbar spinous processes are longitudinally split, then supraspinous and interspinous ligaments are sharply cut off longitudinally. After converting to lumbar flexion, lamina osteotomy is innovatively finished by an UBS through interspinous space. After decompression, hollow screws are firstly suggested to be used on each side to fix lamina and spinous processes, and PLC is reconstructed by interrupted suture. Feasibility of this method is evaluated in details. Challenges, advantages and disadvantages are also discussed.
