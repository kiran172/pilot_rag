Title: Airway and Ventilator Management in a New Presentation of Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: In the acute setting, subglottic stenosis poses a unique airway management challenge, particularly when presenting to a facility where subspecialty care is not available. We present a case of idiopathic subglottic stenosis with acute respiratory distress managed at a community hospital to highlight the challenges of diagnosis, initial airway management, and mechanical ventilation of this rare but life-threatening condition.
