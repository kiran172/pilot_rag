Title: Electroconvulsive therapy in a patient with left main and triple vessel Coronary Artery Disease (CAD): Anaesthetic management.

Abstract: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment for many psychiatric disorders. The passage of electrical current lead to hemodynamic alterations which may be detrimental to patients suffering from severe coronary artery disease. We describe perioperative anesthetic management of a patient having severe left main coronary artery stenosis (LMCAS) with severe triple vessel coronary artery disease (TVD).
