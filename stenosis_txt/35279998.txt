Title: [Causes, diagnosis and treatment strategies for dental pulp calcification].

Abstract: Dental pulp calcification can lead to root canal stenosis or obliteration. It is usually difficult to negotiate the root canal if the affected tooth needs to be treated and intraoperative complications are easily brought about during the root canal treatment. The etiologies of dental pulp calcification are complicated and careful considerations should be given to the diagnosis and treatment. Only by weighing the advantages and disadvantages can appropriate treatment plan be chosen. Based on the literature and authors' clinical experiences, the present article summarizes the causes, pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment strategies of dental pulp calcification, in order to provide some references in diagnosis and treatment for the dental clinicians.
