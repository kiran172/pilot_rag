Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for aortic regurgitation in HeartMate II supported patient using Myval THV: a case report.

Abstract: De novo aortic regurgitation (AR) presents a great challenge following left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation and requires valve replacement in some cases. Patients with LVAD are frequently those who underwent multiple previous sternotomies or suffer from multiple comorbidities. Thus, they are at high surgical risk for further sternotomy. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) previously approved for treatment of severe aortic stenosis is also used for this category of patients. Here, we report the case of a young female patient supported with heart mate II LVAD who presented with severe de novo AR. The patient was successfully treated with TAVI using Myval trancatheter heart valve (THV) in our center. To our knowledge, our patient is the first to be treated with such type of valve using TAVI procedure in LVAD supported patients.
