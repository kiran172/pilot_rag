Title: Evaluation of Portal, Splenic, and Hepatic Vein Flows in Children Undergoing Congenital Heart Surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Little is known about changes in portal, splenic, and hepatic vein flow patterns in children undergoing congenital heart surgery. This study aimed to determine the characteristics of portal, splenic, and hepatic vein flow patterns using ultrasonography in children undergoing cardiac surgery.
DESIGN: Single-center, prospective observational study.
SETTING: Tertiary children's hospital, operating room.
PARTICIPANTS: Children undergoing cardiac surgery.
MEASUREMENT AND MAIN RESULTS: The authors obtained ultrasound data from the heart, inferior vena cava, portal, splenic, and hepatic veins before and after surgeries. In the biventricular group, which included children with atrial and ventricular septal defects and pulmonary stenosis (n = 246), the portal pulsatility index decreased from 38.7% to 25.6% (p &lt; 0.001) after surgery. The preoperative portal pulsatility index was significantly higher in patients with pulmonary hypertension (43.3% v 27.4%; p &lt; 0.001). In the single-ventricle group (n = 77), maximum portal vein flow velocities of Fontan patients were significantly lower (13.5 cm/s) compared with that of patients with modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (19.7 cm/s; p = 0.035) or bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt (23.1 cm/s; p &lt; 0.001). The cardiac index was inversely correlated with the portal pulsatility index in the bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt and Fontan circulation. (β = -5.693, r2 = 0.473; p = 0.001) The portal pulsatility index was correlated with splenic venous pulsatility and hepatic venous atrial reverse flow velocity in biventricular and single-ventricle groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The characteristics of venous Doppler patterns in the portal, splenic, and hepatic veins differed according to congenital heart disease. Further studies are required to determine the association between splanchnic venous Doppler findings and clinical outcomes in this population.
