Title: Subglottic Hemangioma: Now You See it, Now You Don't.

Abstract: Subglottic hemangiomas may be missed on flexible laryngoscopy or even bronchoscopy requiring a contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan to clinch the diagnosis. We report an otherwise healthy three-month baby girl presenting with recurrent upper airway obstruction with a history of multiple admissions requiring intubation and artificial ventilation. An initial contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan was performed when the child was intubated, which showed no airway anomalies. Subsequent flexible laryngoscopy and diagnostic bronchoscopy showed features of laryngomalacia and subglottic edema; hence, an endoscopic laser-assisted supraglottoplasty was performed. Following the surgical intervention, the child had persistent stridor and a repeat contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan clinched a diagnosis of a localised subglottic hemangioma at the age of 7 months. In the presence of an endotracheal tube, airway hemangiomas may be missed on bronchoscopy and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan.
