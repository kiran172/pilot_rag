Title: Efficacy of Multichannel Balloon Angioplasty in Calcified Common Femoral Artery Lesions.

Abstract: This report describes 7 cases in which multichannel balloon angioplasty was performed for severely calcified common femoral artery stenosis. After the successful passage of a guidewire through the stenosis, another guidewire with a tip load of 12g or 14 g was passed through a different channel inside the calcified plaques, followed by balloon angioplasty via each route. After the procedure, ankle brachial index improved from 0.49 ± 0.23 to 0.89 ± 0.05 on an average, and 6 of the 7 patients had patent arteries at a median follow-up period of 13 months. Multichannel balloon angioplasty offers the promise of being an effective endovascular intervention to expand calcified lesions.
