Title: Congenital supravalvular aortic stenosis in a kitten.

Abstract: A three-month-old, male intact Norwegian forest cat without any clinical signs was referred to the cardiology service of the author's teaching hospital for evaluation of a cardiac murmur. The murmur was systolic with an intensity of 4 out of 6 with the point of maximal intensity at the left heart base. Echocardiography revealed a moderate mitral valve regurgitation and a moderate dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction both resulting from systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve (SAM). Moreover, left ventricular concentric hypertrophy was noted. Oral atenolol therapy was initiated. Recheck examination 3.5 months later revealed unchanged murmur characteristics in the still asymptomatic kitten. Echocardiography showed no SAM, but there was a severe fixed aortic stenosis apparent caused by a discrete supravalvular lesion, 4 mm distal to the valve, with an hourglass morphology. Supravalvular aortic stenosis is a rare congenital anomaly in cats, which has not been reported antemortem yet.
