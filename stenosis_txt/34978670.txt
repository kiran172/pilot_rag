Title: Comprehensive echocardiographic and speckle tracking strain analysis in rheumatic mitral stenosis patients before and after transvenous mitral commissurotomy.

Abstract: Percutaneous Transvenous Mitral Commissurotomy (PTMC) is the first line treatment for rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS). We sought to evaluate (1) changes in 2-dimensional (2D) echocardiographic and strain values and (2) differences in these values for patients in atrial fibrillation (AF) and sinus rhythm (SR) pre, immediately and 6 months post PTMC. Retrospective study of 136 patients who underwent PTMC between 2011 and 2021. We analyzed their 2D echocardiogram, Global Longitudinal Strain (GLS), Left Atrial Reservoir Strain (LAr-S) and Right Ventricle Free Wall Strain (RVFW-S) pre, immediately and 6 months post PTMC. At 6 months, mitral valve area increases from 0.94 ± 0.23 cm2 to 1.50 ± 0.42 cm2. Ejection fraction (EF) did not change post PTMC (pre; 55.56 ± 6.62%, immediate; 56.68 ± 7.83%, 6 months; 56.28 ± 7.00%, p = 0.218). Even though EF is preserved, GLS is lower pre-procedure; - 11.52 ± 3.74% with significant improvement at 6 months; - 15.16 ± 4.28% (p &lt; 0.001). Tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) improved at 6 months from 1.95 ± 0.43 to 2.11 ± 0.49 (p = 0.004). RVFW-S increases at 6 months from - 17.37 ± 6.03% to - 19.75 ± 7.19% (p = 0.011). LAr-S improved from 11.23 ± 6.83% pre PTMC to 16.80 ± 8.82% at 6 months (p &lt; 0.001) post PTMC. Pre-procedure patients with AF have lower strain values (More LV, RV and LA dysfunction) with statistically significant difference for LAr-S (p &lt; 0.001), GLS (p &lt; 0.001) and RVFW-S (p &lt; 0.001) than patients in SR. Patients with severe rheumatic MS have subclinical left and right ventricle dysfunction despite preserved EF and relatively normal TAPSE with significant improvement seen at 6 months post PTMC. AF patients have lower baseline strain values than SR patients.
