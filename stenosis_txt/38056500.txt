Title: [Functional, Radiological and Endoscopic Diagnostic of Tracheal Diseases].

Abstract: Diseases of the trachea are rare, while other diseases associated with shortness of breath and pulmonary symptoms are common, which is why the necessary diagnosis and therapy are regularly delayed. At the same time, diseases range from simple scarring stenosis to extensive tumour disease. Patients may be otherwise healthy, suffer from autoimmune disease, or have severe general illnesses, as in tracheotomised patients. Therefore, history and clinical examination provide very important clues to a disease of the trachea. Subsequent diagnostics should be ordered in a reasonable manner and lead to the correct diagnosis and subsequent therapy in a timely manner. Functional, radiological and endoscopic examinations, each with a special focus in experienced hands, avoid duplicate examinations or misinterpretations. Patients are grateful because diseases of the trachea - a central airway that cannot be bypassed - are experienced as life-threatening or at least as severely limiting the quality of life.
