Title: Mediastinal Lymph Node Metastasis of Esophageal Cancer with Esophageal Stenosis Diagnosed via Transesophageal Endoscopic Ultrasound with Bronchoscope-guided Fine-needle Aspiration.

Abstract: An 80-year-old man underwent follow-up examinations after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for esophageal cancer. Computed tomography showed enlarged lymph nodes of the right recurrent nerve. The patient had esophageal stenosis due to repeated ESD for multiple esophageal tumors. The stenosis made the passage of an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) scope through the esophagus difficult. Thus, an endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscope, which had a thinner diameter than that of the EUS scope, was used for transesophageal endoscopic ultrasound with bronchoscope-guided fine-needle aspiration. This technique led to the diagnosis of mediastinal lymph node metastasis of esophageal cancer.
