Title: A comprehensive comparison of the early and late complications of surgical circumcision in neonates and children: A cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Major circumcision complications are rare; however, circumcision arouses distress in some special cases. The present study aimed to compare infancy and childhood regarding the frequency and relative risk of early and late complications of circumcision.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort data analysis including 240 neonates and 240 children referred for circumcision from 2015 to 2021. All circumcisions were performed using the surgical dorsal-ventral slits method. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to assess the relative risk (RR) of complications at a confidence Interval of 95%.
RESULTS: The mean age was 19.32 ± 6.5 days for the neonates and 46.1 ± 8.8 months for the children. In general, complications occurred in 61 boys (12.7%), 40 neonates (8.3%), and 21 children (4.4%) (p˂0.001). Bleeding was the most common early complication in six neonates (2.5%) and three children (1.3%), and meatal stenosis was the most common late complication in 10 neonates (4.2%) and four children (1.6%). Meatal web was observed in 11 neonates (4.6%) and four children (1.6%), and the incomplete removal of the prepuce, as "not very satisfactory", was also noticed in nine neonates (3.75%) and three children (1.3%). The circumcision complications were significantly more frequent in neonates than in children (RR = 2.6, 95% CI 1.46-4.71, p&lt;0.001). The neonatal circumcisions had a significant risk of the incomplete removal of the prepuce, meatal web, and meatal stenosis compared to children (RR = 3, 95% CI 5.83-10.81, p&lt;0.04; RR = 2.75, 95% CI 0.9-8.3, p˂0.03; RR = 2.5, 95% CI 0.8-7.75, p&lt;0.04, respectively).
CONCLUSION: The risk of complications is higher in neonates than children. The incomplete removal of prepuce, meatal web, and meatal stenosis are significantly higher in neonates than in children. Before prohibiting or recommending this procedure, practitioners should provide comprehensive information about its risks and benefits. Parents should weigh up the risks and benefits and make the best decision regarding their personal beliefs and customs.
