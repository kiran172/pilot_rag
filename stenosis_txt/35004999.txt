Title: Excimer laser coronary atherectomy for a severe calcified coronary ostium lesion: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention can be challenging for ostial coronary artery lesions due to calcium burden and elastic fiber content. Excimer laser coronary atherectomy (ELCA) is a less common treatment for severe calcified coronary ostium lesions.
CASE SUMMARY: An 81-year-old male presented to the Cardiology Department of Qingdao Municipal Hospital with a 1-year history of chest pain. Coronary angiography showed severe calcific stenosis (approximately 90%) in the right coronary artery ostium. The right coronary artery ostium was unable to be advanced using a 2.5 mm × 12.0 mm balloon (NC Sprinter, Medtronic, United States) or dilated using a 2.0 mm × 12.0 mm balloon (Sprinter, Medtronic, United States). The patient underwent successful ELCA and balloon dilation of the calcified coronary ostium lesion.
CONCLUSION: ELCA appears to be a safe and effective treatment for the management of severe calcified coronary ostium lesions.
