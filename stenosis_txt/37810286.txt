Title: Facet joint thickness and lumbar instability documented on myelo-computed tomography studies in patients with lumbar degenerative disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Various indicators of vertebral instability in patients with lumbar degenerative disease can be identified in myelo-computed tomography (CT) studies.
METHODS: Of 120 patients, 45 with lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS; 53 lumbar lesions) and 75 with lumbar spinal stenosis alone (LSS; 105 lesions) (2015-2019) myelo-CT studies and surgery confirmed the presence of lumbar instability. Myelo-CT findings indicative of instability included facet joint thickness (FJT), fluid in the facet joint, facet tropism, and air in the facet and/or disc.
RESULTS: For the 120 study patients, FJT was significantly elevated in both the LDS and LSS groups.
CONCLUSION: FJT on myelo-CT is more specific for lumbar instability than other imaging parameters when evaluating LDS. An increase in FJT suggests vertebral instability likely warranting fusion.
