Title: Three centers experience with device closure of congenital Gerbode-type perimembranous ventricular septal defects.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aim to evaluate our experience with interventional closure of Gerbode-type perimembranous ventricular septal defects (pmVSDs).
METHODS: We performed three-center retrospective data review of patients with congenital indirect Gerbode-type pmVSDs treated percutaneously between August 2017 and May 2021. Standard safety and latest follow-up outcomes were assessed.
RESULTS: Ten patients (six females) were identified with a median age of 6.8 years (range: 2.5-54) and a median weight of 26.5 kg (range: 12-88). The median left ventricular defect size was 10 mm (range: 3-15.5). On baseline ultrasound, 6 patients had absent subaortic rim , 6 patients had trivial aortic regurgitation, and 3 patients had tear-drop-type (small) aortic cusp prolapse. The tricuspid regurgitation was graded II (n = 5) and III (n = 5). Five Lifetech Konar-Multifunctional occluders, four Amplatzer duct occluders II and one Amplatzer duct occluder I were implanted. The median fluoroscopy time was 10.4 min (range: 4.3-20.2). Pre-existing aortic regurgitations remained identical. One new aortic regurgitation was identified before discharge and remained trivial after 48 months of follow-up. No heart block or tricuspid stenosis was observed on a median follow-up of 17 months (range: 3-48). All patients are symptom-free with complete shunt closure and significant regression or resolution of tricuspid regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite anatomical challenges, interventional closure of congenital indirect Gerbode-type pmVSD appears to be feasible, safe, and most importantly clinically effective using different commercially available devices. Amplatzer duct occluder II and Lifetech Konar-Multifunctional occluder offer interesting specifications to retrogradely target this specific defect with success.
