Title: Survival in elderly patients with transcatheter aortic valve implants compared with the general population.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Severe symptomatic aortic stenosis carries a very poor prognosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has been demonstrated to change the natural history of the disease. However, it is not known whether the probability of survival in older patients receiving this treatment returns to a similar value to that in the general population. Our objective was to determine survival in these patients vs that in the general population.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the survival curves of patients older than 75 years who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) at our hospital and compared them with those in the general population of the same age, sex, and geographic region by using data from the Spanish National Institute of Statistics.
RESULTS: We analyzed 526 patients. Among postoperative survivors, survival curves were similar between the 2 groups during most of the follow-up. In TAVI patients, the probability of survival at 1, 3, 5, and 8 years of follow-up was 90.58% (confidence interval [CI] 95%, 87.54-92.91), 72.51% (95%CI, 67.38-76.97), 53.23% (95%CI, 46.52-59.48), and 35.73% (95%CI, 27.72-43.80). In the reference population, these percentages were 91.93%, 75.63%, 59.6%, and 37.47%.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term survival in elderly patients undergoing TAVI is influenced by postoperative mortality. In patients surviving the postoperative period, the probability of survival returns to a similar value to that in the general population of the same age, sex, and geographical area.
