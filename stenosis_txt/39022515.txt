Title: Pancreaticoduodenectomy in Patients With Coeliac or Superior Mesenteric Artery Stenosis: A Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's procedure) is a technically demanding operation performed for malignant and premalignant conditions of the pancreatic head, duodenum and bile duct. Awareness of the vascular anatomy, variations, and pathology of this area is essential to achieve safe surgery and good outcomes. The operation involves division of the gastroduodenal artery (GDA) which provides communication between the foregut and midgut blood supply. In patients with coeliac or superior mesenteric artery (SMA) stenosis, this can lead to reduced blood supply to the foregut or midgut organs, with consequent severe ischaemic complications leading to significant morbidity and mortality. Coeliac artery stenosis is caused by median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) in the majority of patients with atherosclerosis being the second most common cause. SMA stenosis is much less common and is caused in the majority of cases by atherosclerosis. A review of preoperative imaging and intraoperative gastroduodenal artery clamp test is important to identify cases that may need additional procedures to preserve the blood supply. In this paper, we present a literature review for studies reporting patients undergoing Whipple's operation with concomitant coeliac axis stenosis (CAS) or SMA stenosis. Analysis of causes of stenosis or occlusion, prevalence, risk factors, different management strategies and outcomes was conducted.
