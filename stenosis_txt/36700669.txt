Title: Absolute and relative contraindications to proximal protection: do they really matter? A case-illustrative approach.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an established technique to treat carotid artery stenosis. Favorable results have been reported in different subsets of patients in both acute and long-term settings. Among the CAS periprocedural variables the type of cerebral protection - distal filter and proximal protection - play a pivot role to reduce cerebral embolization. Accumulating evidence is in favor of better performance of proximal protection vs. distal filters. However, the rate of worldwide penetration of this devise is low. Potential reasons include a lengthy list of technical issues that may account for the reluctance of filter-oriented operators to change systems. This paper shows how to identify, treat, and overcome these technical obstacles.
