Title: Pyoderma Gangrenosum Is Associated With Increased Risk of Inflammatory Pouch-Related Complications: A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, neutrophilic dermatosis that is a well-established extraintestinal manifestation (EIM) of inflammatory bowel disease. The clinical implications of developing PG in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) who undergo total proctocolectomy colectomy and ileal pouch anal anastomosis (TPC-IPAA) surgery remain unknown.
METHODS: Study participants were selected from patients enrolled in the Carlino Family Inflammatory Bowel and Colorectal Disease Biobank between 1998 and 2021 with a pre-colectomy diagnosis of UC and who underwent TPC-IPAA surgery. A retrospective study comparing patients with PG and those without PG was performed. The outcomes measured included the development of pouchitis, pouchitis classification, presence of pouch fistula, anal fistula, anal stenosis, and pouch failure.
RESULTS: In this study, 357 IPAA patients were included, 10 of whom suffered PG. Patients with PG and without PG had similar demographics and clinical characteristics. Both groups had similar rates of pouchitis (80% in PG patients and 64% in patients without PG, P = .504). However, IPAA patients with PG had a higher risk of developing pouch fistula (50% vs 10%, P = .002), anal fistula (40% vs 12%, P = .031), and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (70% vs 15%, P = .003) compared to patients without PG. Patients who developed PG prior to their first episode of pouchitis were more likely to eventually experience pouch failure (odds ratio: 20.7, 95% confidence interval: 3.9, 110.7, q = 0.003 after false discovery rate adjustment).
CONCLUSIONS: Among UC patients who undergo TPC-IPAA surgery, the development of PG portends poor pouch outcomes and is predictive of pouch failure.
