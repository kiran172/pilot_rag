Title: [Midterm outcome comparison between patients with bicuspid or tricuspid aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement].

Abstract: Objective: To compare the prognosis of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) or tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) stenosis. Methods: This was a retrospective study. Patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, who underwent TAVR with follow-up time more than one year in Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from April 2016 to August 2018, were included. According to aortic CT angiography, the patients were divided into BAV group and TAV group. The primary endpoint was the composite event of all-cause death and stroke, and the secondary endpoints were TAVR-related complications. Incidence of clinical endpoints and parameters derived from echocardiography were compared between the groups, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to compare the composite event between the two groups. Results: A total of 49 patients were included. The age was (73.6±6.3) years, and 25(51.0%) were male. There were 32 patients in BAV group and 17 in TAV group, the follow-up time was 466 (390, 664) days. The incidence of composite endpoint of death and stroke at one year were comparable in BAV and TAV groups (6.3% (2/32) vs. 5.9% (1/17), P=1.00). Kaplan-Meier curves also showed a similar risk of the composite endpoint(HR=1.03，95%CI 0.09-11.24，Log-rank P=0.98) between two groups. The incidence of all-cause death, stroke, myocardial infarction, severe bleeding, major vascular complications, new-onset atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, and permanent pacemaker implantation were all similar between the two groups(all P&gt;0.05), and there was no acute kidney injury (stage 2 or 3) in both groups. Echocardiographic parameters at one year were similar between the two groups (all P&gt;0.05). Conclusions: The midterm prognosis of TAVR in patients with BAV and TAV stenosis is similar. Clinical trials of large sample size with long-term follow-up are warranted to verify our findings.
