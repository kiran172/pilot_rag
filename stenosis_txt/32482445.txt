Title: Long-term Outcome of the Rendezvous Technique in Patients With Severe Biliary Anastomotic Stricture That Cannot Cannulate After Liver Transplant.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nearly all publications related to endoscopic treatment of biliary anastomotic stricture after liver transplant have reported cases that can be cannulated. However, very few publications discuss endoscopic treatment of biliary anastomotic stricture (BAS) in which the guide wire does not pass through the stricture site. The purpose of this article is to analyze the long-term outcome of the Rendezvous technique in severe strictures through which guide wires cannot cannulate.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2017, a total of 29 patients who underwent Rendezvous technique because of severe BAS after liver transplant were included in the study.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients who underwent the Rendezvous technique showed a 100% technical success rate. Ten patients (34.4%) required stent removal; the mean stenting period was 14.9 (SD, 5.6) months (range, 6.65-24.14 months). A total of 19 patients were maintained without stent removal; the stent-maintaining period was 13.1 (SD, 8.4) months (range, 3.48-38.61 months). Two patients receiving left lobe grafts maintained the stents for 27.1 (SD, 16.2) months. In left lobe graft, the duct anastomosis position moves to the right posteroinferior side of the patient.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the stenting period of the Rendezvous technique was longer in severe BAS than in cannulated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography cases. Especially in the left liver, the position of the duct anastomosis changed to the right posteroinferior of the patient. Thus, the donor duct and the recipient duct are angulated, kinking worsens, and the stenting period becomes longer.
