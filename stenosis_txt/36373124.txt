Title: Partial Cricotracheal Resection - Our Experience.

Abstract: Introduction: The incidence of acquired laryngotracheal stenosis is on rise, being caused usually due to prolonged intubation or trauma. Its management has thus become a common clinical challenge for Otolaryngologists and Head and Neck surgeons. Further, with advances in Critical care medicine, Cardiopulmonary surgery and Neurosurgery, the number of intubation-related laryngotracheal injuries is increasing. Objectives: To assess the outcome of patients who underwent Partial Cricotracheal Resection (PCTR) for subglottic stenosis on basis of pre-defined parameters. Design of Study: This is a prospective study. Materials and Methods: Four patients who came to Ear Nose Throat (ENT) department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Patna with complaints of either difficult decannulation or stridor, for which PCTR was planned, were included in the study. Surgical resection was done and all patients were followed up for a minimum of 6 months. Postoperatively certain parameters, such as respiration, voice, difficulty in swallowing, feeding and personal satisfaction, were used to evaluate the patients and analyse the efficacy of the surgery. Results: Three out of four cases came up with complete cure with no dyspnoea, dysphagia, hoarseness of voice. Only one patient could not be extubated and was continued on Ryle's tube for longer duration compared to other patients. Conclusion: PCTR is an effective and reliable procedure for management of laryngotracheal stenosis caused due to trauma.
