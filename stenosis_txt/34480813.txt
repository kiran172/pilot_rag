Title: Biomarkers for heart failure and prognostic prediction in patients with Fontan circulation.

Abstract: A wide variety of pathologies are involved in heart failure in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Specific causes of heart failure after the Fontan procedure include not only single-ventricle circulation, but also the function of the right ventricle as the systemic ventricle, atrioventricular or semilunar valve stenosis or regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and left ventricular dysfunction secondary to right ventricular enlargement or dysfunction. As heart failure can occur post-Fontan, for a variety of reasons, clarification of the pathophysiology is the first step in management and treatment. At the same time, it is important to understand each patient's current condition and treatment plan to make an accurate prognosis. Because of the wide variety of pathophysiologies in post-Fontan CHD patients, however, no single biomarker is useful in all situations. Relevant biomarkers must be selected according to each patient's disease state, and combinations of multiple biomarkers should also be considered. In this review, the author describes the clinical importance of various biomarkers for patients who have undergone a Fontan procedure.
