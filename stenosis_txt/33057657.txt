Title: Impact of paravalvular regurgitation on the mid-term outcome after transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence and prognostic impact of paravalvular regurgitation (PVR) on the outcome after transcatheter (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for aortic stenosis.
METHODS: The nationwide FinnValve registry included data on 6463 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR (n = 2130) or SAVR (n = 4333) with a bioprosthesis for the treatment of aortic stenosis during 2008-2017. The impact of PVR at discharge after TAVR and SAVR on 4-year mortality was herein investigated.
RESULTS: The rate of mild PVR was 21.7% after TAVR and 5.2% after SAVR. The rate of moderate-to-severe PVR was 3.7% after TAVR and 0.7% after SAVR. After TAVR, 4-year survival was 69.0% in patients with none-to-trace PVR, 54.2% with mild PVR [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.64, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.35-1.99] and 48.9% with moderate-to-severe PVR (adjusted HR 1.61, 95% CI 1.10-2.35). Freedom from PVR-related reinterventions was 100% for none-to-mild PVR and 95.2% for moderate-to-severe PVR. After SAVR, mild PVR (4-year survival 78.9%; adjusted HR 1.29, 95% CI 0.93-1.78) and moderate-to-severe PVR (4-year survival 67.8%; adjusted HR 1.36, 95% CI 0.72-2.58) were associated with worse 4-year survival compared to none-to-trace PVR (4-year survival 83.7%), but the difference did not reach statistical significance in multivariable analysis. Freedom from PVR-related reinterventions was 99.5% for none-to-trace PVR patients, 97.9% for mild PVR patients and 77.0% for moderate-to-severe PVR patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This multicentre study showed that both mild and moderate-to-severe PVR were independent predictors of worse survival after TAVR. Mild and moderate-to-severe PVR are not frequent after SAVR, but tend to decrease survival also in these patients.
