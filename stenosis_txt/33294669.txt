Title: Predictors of failure of endoscopic retrograde pancreatocholangiography during common bile duct stones.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography associated with sphincterotomy and stone extraction with balloon or Dormia basket represents the gold standard for the management of common bile duct stones. The aim of our study were to investigate the predictors of failure of standard endoscopic techniques during the management of common bile duct stones.
METHODS: A retrospective study including all endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for common bile duct stones between January 2014 and December 2017 was conducted. First line treatment was based on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with endoscopic sphincterotomy and balloon or Dormia extraction. Second line endoscopic treatment was based on macrodilatation of Oddi sphincter, mechanical lithotripsy, biliary stent or nasobiliary drain placement. Predictors of failure of standard endoscopic techniques were sought by uni and multivariate analysis (SPSS software, p significant if < 0.05).
RESULTS: One hundred eighty one patients (mean age 64 years and sex ratio M/W = 0.4) were included. Main indications for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography were residual or recurrent lithiasis (67.4%, n = 122). Cholangiography revealed multiple stones in 53 patients with an average size of 12.5mm [3-40]. The success rate of first line treatment was 61.9%. Independent predictors of failure of standard endoscopic techniques (failure of papillary cannulation or stone extraction) according to multivariate analysis were: an age greater than 65 years OR 0.516 [0.272-0.979], an intra-diverticular papilla OR 0.179 [0.035-0.914], a common bile duct diameter greater than 15 mm OR 0.161 [0.068-0.385] and a stenosis of the common bile duct OR 0.068 [0.008-0.605]. The success rate of the second line treatment was 73%.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography results in a successful clearance of the common bile duct in almost two-thirds of patients. In case of predictors of failure, alternative techniques can increase this rate.
