Title: Management of vaginoplasty canal complications.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasing uptake of gender affirming surgery has allowed for a wider breadth of publication examining complications associated with vaginoplasty. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of complications associated with vaginoplasty procedures, focusing on intraoperative, early postoperative, and delayed postoperative complications across different surgical techniques.
RECENT FINDINGS: Intraoperative complications such as bleeding, injury of the rectum, urethra and prostate, and intra-abdominal injury are discussed, with insights into their incidence rates and management strategies. Early postoperative complications, including wound dehiscence, infection, and voiding dysfunction, are highlighted alongside their respective treatment approaches. Moreover, delayed postoperative complications such as neovaginal stenosis, vaginal depth reduction, vaginal prolapse, rectovaginal fistula, and urinary tract fistulas are assessed, with a focus on their etiology, incidence rates, and management options.
SUMMARY: Vaginoplasty complications range from minor wound issues to severe functional problems, necessitating a nuanced understanding of their management. Patient counseling, surgical approach, and postoperative care optimization emerge as crucial strategies in mitigating the impact of complications. Standardizing complication reporting and further research are emphasized to develop evidence-based strategies for complication prevention and management in vaginoplasty procedures.
