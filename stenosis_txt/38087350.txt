Title: Clinical significance of redundant nerve roots in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis undergoing oblique lumbar interbody fusion combined with percutaneous internal fixation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: While there have been previous studies on the surgical efficacy of patients with redundant nerve roots (RNRs), a persistent issue is that some patients continue to experience redundancy even after surgery. Furthermore, the clinical significance of RNRs remains unclear. Notably, there is a lack of research regarding RNRs within the context of oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) combined with percutaneous internal fixation. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to investigate the correlation between RNRs and clinical outcomes following OLIF combined with percutaneous internal fixation.
METHODS: Eighty-seven patients diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) who underwent single-segment OLIF combined with percutaneous internal fixation were categorized into three groups. Group 1 comprised patients with positive RNRs both before and after the operation. Group 2 included patients with positive RNRs preoperatively but negative RNRs postoperatively. Group 3 consisted of patients with consistently negative RNRs before and after the operation. Comprehensive patient data were collected, including operation time, intraoperative blood loss, and any recorded complications. Radiographic parameters, both pre- and post-operative, were assessed, encompassing the number of stenosis segments, disc height (DH), lumbar lordotic angle, dural sac cross-sectional area, and the placement of the fusion cage. Furthermore, the Visual Analogue Scale was applied to gauge back and leg pain, while the Oswestry Disability Index was employed to appraise daily living activities. A comparative analysis was carried out among the three patient groups.
RESULTS: In this study, all 87 LSS patients successfully underwent surgery. Among them, 35 patients (40.2%) showed preoperative MRI assessment indicating positive RNRs. In the postoperative MRI assessment, 14 of these patients maintained positive RNRs status, and they were grouped into Group 1. The remaining 21 patients saw a transition to negative RNRs status and were included in Group 2. Among the 52 patients who had preoperative MRI assessments showing negative RNRs, their postoperative RNRs status remained negative, forming Group 3. All patients received follow-up, which ranged from 8 to 18Â months, and no complications occurred during this period. In this study, the postoperative efficacy and parameters such as DH and Dural Sac CSA significantly improved compared to preoperative values for all 87 patients. Patients with preoperative RNRs had more stenosis segments, smaller dural sac CSA, and more severe symptoms. In all three groups, postoperative efficacy scores significantly improved compared to preoperative scores. Group 2 patients had their fusion cages placed more in the middle, while Group 1 patients had their fusion cages more anteriorly located. Group 2 patients exhibited greater recovery in dural sac CSA postoperatively compared to Group 1 patients. Additionally, Group 2 patients had better ODI efficacy scores compared to Group 1 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Irrespective of the presence or absence of RNRs, patients experienced improvement after undergoing OLIF combined with percutaneous internal fixation. Preoperative RNRs appear to be linked to multi-segmental lumbar spinal stenosis, a reduction in dural sac CSA, and symptom severity. Patients with negative postoperative RNRs demonstrated better treatment efficacy. Furthermore, the placement of the fusion cage appears to have a significant impact on postoperative efficacy and RNRs outcomes.
