Title: Hybrid surgery techniques for the treatment of in-stent restenosis after 5 years of femoral artery self-expanding bare-metal stent implantation: A case report.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans (ASO) disease is caused by the formation of atherosclerotic plaque in the femoral artery, which causes the stenosis and occlusion of lower legs, and then leads to chronic limb ischemia. Stent intervention is the most common treatment for ASO in the lower extremities, although there is a risk of overstretching or fracturing the stent, resulting in stent rupture. We provide a unique method for treating stent rupture.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 79-year-old male presented with intermittent claudication of the left lower limb for 6 months. Five years ago, a stent was placed in the lower extremity femoral artery. According to the examination, the stent suffered a modest torsional fracture.
DIAGNOSIS: The case was diagnosed with lower extremity ASO.
INTERVENTIONS: We performed a combination of femoral endarterectomy and interventional surgery.
OUTCOMES: Blood flow was restored after the hybrid operation has been used to treat arterial stenosis in the lower limbs.
CONCLUSION: Integrating vascular interventional surgeries can shorten surgical procedures time and increase success rates.
