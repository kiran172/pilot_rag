Title: Stability of SF-36 profiles between 2007 and 2016: A study of 27,302 patients surgically treated for lumbar spine diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that patients with different lumbar spine diseases report different SF-36 profiles, but data on the stability of the SF-36 profiles are limited. The primary aim of the current study was to evaluate the stability of the SF-36 profile for lumbar spine diseases.
METHODS: Patients, surgically treated between 2007 and 2016 for three lumbar spine diseases, lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS), LSS without DS, and lumbar disk herniations (LDH), were identified in the Swedish spine register. Preoperative and 1 year postoperative SF-36 data for a total of 27,302 procedures were available for analysis. The stability of the SF-36 profiles over the 10-year period was evaluated using graphical exploration, linear regression, difference in means, and 95% confidence intervals. The responsiveness of the SF-36 domains to surgical treatment was evaluated using the standardized response mean (SRM).
RESULTS: LSS and LDH have different SF-36 profiles. LSS with DS and LSS without DS have similar SF-36 profiles. The preoperative and the 1 year postoperative SF-36 profiles were stable from 2007 to 2016 for all three diagnoses. There were no major changes in the effect size of change (SRM) during the study period for all three diagnoses. For LSS with DS, the number of fusions peaked in 2010 and then decreased. The postoperative SF-36 profiles for LSS with DS were unaffected by changes in surgical treatment trends.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis and lumbar disk herniations have different SF-36 profiles. Concomitant degenerative spondylolisthesis had no impact on the SF-36 profile of lumbar spinal stenosis. Adding fusion to the decompression did not alter the postoperative SF-36 profile of lumbar spinal stenosis. The SF-36 health profiles are stable from a 10 years perspective.
