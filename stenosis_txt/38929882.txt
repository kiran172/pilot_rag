Title: Calcium-Free Dialysate Hemodialysis: A Simplified Approach.

Abstract: Intermittent hemodialysis (HD) in high-bleeding-risk patients presents a challenge as circuit anticoagulation using heparin is contraindicated in such cases. Recently, the use of calcium-free citrate-containing dialysate with calcium supplementation emerged as a viable alternative to heparin-circuit anticoagulation. This is a retrospective, monocentric study to evaluate dialysis efficacy using calcium-free citrate-containing dialysate with calcium reinjection into the venous line in hemodialysis patients at risk of bleeding. A total of 53 patients were analyzed: 52 had a temporary contraindication to systemic anticoagulation (active bleeding or surgical intervention), and 1 chronic HD patient had prolonged bleeding time due to inoperable arteriovenous fistula stenosis. Only 7 out of 79 dialysis sessions performed were prematurely terminated (vascular access dysfunction). The median dialysis time was 240 min (range: 150-300). The chronic dialysis patient had 108 sessions with no premature termination. Frequent monitoring of ionized calcium was performed throughout the dialysis sessions: levels remained stable at T0 and T + 60 min (1.08 ± 0.08 mmol/L) and slightly increased at the end of the dialysis session (1.19 ± 0.13 mmol/L), remaining within normal limits. Target postfilter ionized calcium <0.4 mmol/L was achieved in all sessions (0.31 ± 0.07 mmol/L). There were no cases of symptomatic hypo-/hypercalcemia and no need for calcium infusion rate adjustment throughout the sessions. Hemodialysis with calcium-free citrate-containing dialysate and calcium reinjection into the venous line is efficient and safe in HD patients with contraindications to systemic anticoagulation.
