Title: Biomarkers Associated with Aortic Stenosis and Structural Bioprosthesis Dysfunction.

Abstract: Prediction of patients at risk of aortic valve stenosis (AS), AS progression rate, and aortic bioprosthesis dysfunction are of major importance for clinical management and/or prevention. Many imaging modalities may be used; however, they may not be conclusive or available for all patients. Circulating biomarkers are easily available and may be related to a disease or process such as aortic valve calcification or associated with a risk factor of the disease. This article reviews current blood biomarkers associated with aortic valve stenosis/calcification and bioprosthesis dysfunction.
