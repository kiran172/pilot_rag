Title: Analysis of Complications in (Crico-) Tracheal Resection Anastomosis in Adults: A Multicenter Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The gold standard treatments for advanced laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) are represented by partial crico-tracheal (PCTRA) or tracheal resection and anastomosis (TRA). These procedures are potentially burdened by high postoperative complication rates. We investigated the impact of the most common stenosis and patient-related characteristics on the onset of complications in a multicentric cohort.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PCTRA or TRA for LTS of different etiologies in three referral centers. We tested the effectiveness of these procedures, the impact of complications on the outcomes, and identified factors causing postoperative complications.
RESULTS: A total of 267 patients were included in the study (130 females; mean age, 51.46 ± 17.64 years). The overall decannulation rate was 96.4%. Altogether, 102 (38.2%) patients presented at least one complication, whereas 12 (4.5%) had two or more. The only independent predictor of post-surgical complications was the presence of systemic comorbidities (p = 0.043). Patients experiencing complications needed additional surgery more frequently (70.1% vs. 29.9%, p < 0.001), and had a longer duration of hospitalization (20 ± 10.9 vs. 11.3 ± 4.1 days, p < 0.001). Six of 102 (5.9%) patients with complications had restenosis, although this event did not occur among patients without complications.
CONCLUSION: PCTRA and TRA have an excellent success rate even when performed for high-grade LTS. However, a significant percentage of patients may experience complications associated with a longer duration of hospitalization or the need for additional surgeries. The presence of medical comorbidities was independently related to an increased risk of complications.
