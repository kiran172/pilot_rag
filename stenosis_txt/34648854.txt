Title: Vascular Response Toward an Absorbable Sirolimus-eluting Polymeric Scaffold for Vascular Application in a Model of Normal Porcine Carotid Arteries.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fully absorbable polymeric scaffolds, as a potential alternative to permanent metallic stents, are entering the clinical field. The aim of this study is to assess the in vivo biocompatibility of a novel Sirolimus-eluting (SIR) absorbable scaffold based on poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) and poly(4-hydroxybutyrate) (P4HB) for interventional application.
METHODS: Absorbable PLLA/P4HB scaffolds either loaded with SIR coating or unloaded scaffolds were implanted interventionally into common carotid arteries of 14 female. Bare metal stents (BMS) served as control. Peroral dual anti-platelet therapy was administered throughout the study. Stented common carotid arteries segments were explanted after 4 weeks, and assessed histomorphometrically.
RESULTS: The absorbable scaffolds showed a decreased residual lumen area and higher stenosis after 4 weeks (PLLA/P4HB: 6.56 ± 0.41 mm² and 37.56 ± 4.67%; SIR-PLLA/P4HB: 6.90 ± 0.58 mm² and 35.60 ± 3.15%) as compared to BMS (15.29 ± 1.86 mm² and 7.65 ± 2.27%). Incorporation of SIR reduced the significantly higher inflammation of unloaded scaffolds however not to a level compared to bare metal stent (PLLA/P4HB: 1.20 ± 0.19; SIR-PLLA/P4HB: 0.96 ± 0.24; BMS: 0.54 ± 0.12). In contrast, the BMS showed a slightly elevated vascular injury score (0.74 ± 0.15), as compared to the PLLA/P4HB (0.54 ± 0.20) and the SIR-PLLA/P4HB (0.48 ± 0.15) groups.
CONCLUSION: In this preclinical model, the new absorbable polymeric (SIR-) scaffolds showed similar technical feasability and safety for vascular application as the permanent metal stents. The higher inflammatory propensity of the polymeric scaffolds was slightly reduced by SIR-coating. A smaller strut thickness of the polymeric scaffolds might have been a positive effect on tissue ingrowth between the struts and needs to be addressed in future work on the stent design.
