Title: Role of C/EBP Homologous Protein in Vascular Stenosis After Carotid Artery Injury.

Abstract: The study aims to explore the fluctuating expression of C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP) following rat carotid artery injury and its central role in vascular stenosis. Using in vivo rat carotid artery injury models and in vitro ischemia and hypoxia cell models employing human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) and vascular smooth muscle cells (T/G HA-VSMCs), a comprehensive investigative framework was established. Histological analysis confirmed intimal hyperplasia in rat models. CHOP expression in vascular tissues was assessed using Western blot and immunohistochemical staining, and its presence in HAECs and T/G HA-VSMCs was determined through RT-PCR and Western blot. The study evaluated HAEC apoptosis, inflammatory cytokine secretion, cell proliferation, and T/G HA-VSMCs migration through Western blot, ELISA, CCK8, and Transwell migration assays. The rat carotid artery injury model revealed substantial fibrous plaque formation and vascular stenosis, resulting in an increased intimal area and plaque-to-lumen area ratio. Notably, CHOP is markedly elevated in vessels of the carotid artery injury model compared to normal vessels. Atorvastatin effectively mitigated vascular stenosis and suppresses CHOP protein expression. In HAECs, ischemia and hypoxia-induced CHOP upregulation, along with heightened TNFα, IL-6, caspase3, and caspase8 levels, while reducing cell proliferation. Atorvastatin demonstrated a dose-dependent suppression of CHOP expression in HAECs. Downregulation of CHOP or atorvastatin treatment led to reduced IL-6 and TNFα secretion, coupled with augmented cell proliferation. Similarly, ischemia and hypoxia conditions increased CHOP expression in T/G HA-VSMCs, which was concentration-dependently inhibited by atorvastatin. Furthermore, significantly increased MMP-9 and MMP-2 concentrations in the cell culture supernatant correlated with enhanced T/G HA-VSMCs migration. However, interventions targeting CHOP downregulation and atorvastatin usage curtailed MMP-9 and MMP-2 secretion and suppressed cell migration. In conclusion, CHOP plays a crucial role in endothelial injury, proliferation, and VSMCs migration during carotid artery injury, serving as a pivotal regulator in post-injury fibrous plaque formation and vascular remodeling. Statins emerge as protectors of endothelial cells, restraining VSMCs migration by modulating CHOP expression.
