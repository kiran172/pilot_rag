Title: [Endoscopic treatment of cicatricial pyloric stenosis of peptic origin in a 4-year-old boy].

Abstract: Gastric outlet obstruction is an uncommon condition in children. Traditionally, surgery has been the standard mode of treatment, but it is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Endoscopic treatment has emerged as an alternative to conventional treatment. We present the case of a 4-year-old patient with refractory prepyloric stenosis secondary to peptic ulcer disease. The picture begins with vomiting and abdominal pain of 2 months of evolution. Pre-pyloric stenosis was confirmed. Faced with the lack of response to medical treatment and balloon dilation, radiated incisions were made with electrocautery and steroid injections. When medical treatment is not sufficient, endoscopic balloon therapy should be the first therapeutic gesture in this type of stenosis; given its refractoriness, we believe it is important to highlight the usefulness of endoscopic treatment, which could prevent surgery and associated morbidity and mortality.
