Title: Tuberculous bronchial stenosis: Diagnosis and role of interventional bronchoscopy.

Abstract: The reported prevalence of tuberculous bronchial stenosis in children is unknown and rarely reported in English-speaking literature. In adult patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, it varies from 40% in an autopsied series in the preantibiotic era to 10% in patients who have undergone routine bronchofibroscopy in modern times. We describe our experience of four cases of confirmed bronchial stenosis due to MTB collected between January 2000 and June 2021 in this case series descriptive study. The diagnosis of bronchial stenosis due to TB was made on flexible bronchoscopy. A TB diagnosis was made if MTB was cultured from respiratory secretions, when Ziehl-Neelsen smear or GeneXpert MTB/RIF test was positive, or if a chest radiograph revealed radiographic features typical of MTB. Bronchial stenosis due to TB is rare even if airway compression is frequently seen. Although an early diagnosis of bronchial stenosis due to TB is difficult on chest X-rays, all children in this series demonstrated parenchymal changes distal to the stenosis ranging from hyperinflation and lobar collaps to bronchiectasis. If bronchial stenosis resulting from TB disease is diagnosed early, balloon dilatation as described in this report, may be an effective and safe intervention, preventing long-term complications such as irreversible lung destruction, that may require pneumonectomy.
