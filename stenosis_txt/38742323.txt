Title: Hepaticoduodenostomy for Recurrent Biliary Anastomotic Stricture after Liver Transplant.

Abstract: Biliary strictures afterlivertransplant are amenable to endoscopic dilatation or percutaneous dilatation and stenting in most cases. In rare cases, for recurrence or tight stricture, surgery is required, and hepaticojejunostomy is the favored procedure. We report a case of posttransplant stricture in a duct-to-duct anastomosis that could not be accessed due to prior gastric bypass. Despite multiple percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography dilatations, the stricture recurred, and the patient was taken up for bilioenteric bypass. During surgery, dense adhesions in the infracolic compartment with chronically twisted jejunal loops, due to prior mini gastric bypass, were encountered, which prevented the creation of a jejunal Roux limb. Hepaticoduodenostomy was performed with no recurrence of stricture at 12 months. Hepaticoduodenostomy is a viable option for surgical management of recurrent biliary strictures, especially in a setting of prior bariatric/diversion procedures.
