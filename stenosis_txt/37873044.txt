Title: Unique multidisciplinary approach in a patient with small bowel obstruction and chronic mesenteric ischemia.

Abstract: Management of small bowel obstruction (SBO) in patients with symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia is a phenomenon that has not been previously described in the literature. This is an index case report describing the utilization of a multidisciplinary approach in a patient that suffered from SBO from cecal perforation with history of chronic mesenteric ischemia attributed to superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and celiac trunk stenosis. The patient was a 70-year-old female with recent diagnosis of ischemic colitis and chronic mesenteric ischemia, found to have high-grade SBO with transition point in the right lower quadrant. Computerized tomography angiogram showed occluded SMA, and severe celiac artery stenosis. Interventional radiology revascularized the celiac trunk with stent placement prior to right hemicolectomy for management of her high-grade SBO. Prospective research should ascertain whether revascularization indeed leads to improved post-operative outcomes.
