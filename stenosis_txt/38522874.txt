Title: Reconstruction of Fibrous Skeleton of the Heart for Double-Valve Replacement in A Pediatric Patient - Modified Commando Procedure.

Abstract: The so-called Commando procedure, initially described by David and colleagues, consists in the reconstruction of the mitro-aortic fibrous lamina by a patch that enlarges both annuli. Its use has been described to upsize the aortic and mitral annulus for double valve replacement in adolescents. We describe a modified technique of this reconstruction of the fibrous skeleton of the heart, combined with Konno procedure to further enlarge the aortic annulus. In modified Commando procedure, following the reconstruction of aortomitral continuity with a bovine pericardium CardioCel patch (Admedus Regen Pty Ltd, Perth, WA, Australia), an aortic valved conduit that was made on the bench in order to have bottom skirt that enabled the suturing of the composite conduit far inside the left ventricle outflow tract. Coronary buttons were implanted at the supra-commissural level. The advantages of this modified Commando procedure are (1) the creation of a new aortic annulus when the integrity of this annulus has been compromised, (2) the upsizing of both annuli to any possible size of aortic and mitral prostheses, and (3) the relief of any residual left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.
