Title: PON1 rs662, rs854560 and TRIB1 rs17321515, rs2954029 Gene Polymorphisms Are Associated with Lipid Parameters in Patients with Unstable Angina.

Abstract: Acute coronary heart disease (CHD) is mainly caused by the rupture of an unstable atherosclerotic plaque. Many different factors can cause stenosis or even occlusion of the coronary artery lumen, such as vasculitis and platelet aggregation. Our study was performed to assess the association between PON1 rs662, rs854560 and TRIB1 rs17321515, rs2954029 polymorphisms and the risk of CHD, as well as the association between studied polymorphisms and selected clinical parameters affecting the risk of developing ischemic heart disease. A total of 232 patients with unstable angina were enrolled in this study. There were no statistically significant differences in the PON1 rs662, rs854560 and TRIB1 rs17321515, rs2954029 polymorphism distributions between the total study and control groups. Total cholesterol plasma levels were significantly higher in patients with the PON1 rs662 TT genotype compared to those with the CC+TC genotypes, as well as in patients with the PON1 rs854560 TT genotype compared to those with the AA+AT genotypes. LDL plasma levels were significantly increased in patients with the PON1 rs854560 TT genotype compared to those with the AA+AT genotypes. Plasma levels of HDL were significantly decreased in patients with the TRIB1 rs17321515 AA+AG genotypes compared to those with the GG genotype, as well as in patients with the TRIB1 rs2954029 AA+AT genotypes compared to those with the TT genotype. Our results suggest that the analysed polymorphisms are not risk factors for unstable angina in the Polish population. However, the results of this study indicate an association between the PON1 rs662, rs854560 and TRIB1 rs17321515, rs2954029 polymorphisms with lipid parameters in patients with coronary artery disease.
