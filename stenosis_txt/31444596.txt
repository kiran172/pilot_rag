Title: Diagnostic performance of perivascular fat attenuation index to predict hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis: a preliminary coronary computed tomography angiography study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the association between perivascular fat attenuation index (FAI) and hemodynamic significance of coronary lesions.
METHODS: Patients with stable angina who underwent coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurement within 2 weeks were retrospectively included. Lesion-based perivascular FAI, high-risk plaque features, total plaque volume (TPV), machine learning-based FFR<sub>CT</sub>, and other parameters were recorded. Lesions with invasive FFR ≤ 0.8 were considered functionally significant.
RESULTS: This study included 167 patients with 219 lesions. Diameter stenosis (DS), lesion length, TPV, and perivascular FAI were significantly larger or longer in the group of hemodynamically significant lesions (FFR ≤ 0.8). In addition, smaller FFR<sub>CT</sub> value was associated with functionally significant lesions (0.720 ± 0.11 vs 0.846 ± 0.10, p &lt; 0.001). No significant difference was found between the hemodynamically significant and insignificant subgroups with respect to CT-derived high-risk plaque features. According to multivariate analysis, DS, TPV, and perivascular FAI were significant predictors of lesion-specific ischemia. When integrating DS, TPV, and perivascular FAI, the area under the curve (AUC) of this combined method was 0.821, which was similar to that of FFR<sub>CT</sub> (AUC, 0.821 vs 0.850; p = 0.426). The diagnostic accuracy of FFR<sub>CT</sub> was higher than that of the combined approach, but the difference was statistically insignificant (79.0% vs 74.0%, p = 0.093).
CONCLUSIONS: Perivascular FAI was significantly higher for flow-limiting lesions than for non-flow-limiting lesions. The combined use of FAI, TPV, and DS could predict ischemic coronary stenosis with high diagnostic accuracy.
KEY POINTS: • Perivascular FAI was significantly higher for flow-limiting lesions than for non-flow-limiting lesions. • Combined use of FAI, plaque volume, and DS provided diagnostic performance comparable to that of machine learning-based FFR <sub>CT</sub>for predicting ischemic coronary stenosis. • No significant difference was found between the hemodynamically significant and insignificant subgroups with respect to CT-derived high-risk plaque features.
