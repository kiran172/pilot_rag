Title: Analysis of esthetic assessment scales in two surgical approaches for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) is a frequent pathology in neonates, with extramucosal pyloromyotomy being a healing surgery. It may be performed through a transverse subcostal incision (TSI) or a transumbilical incision (TUI).
OBJECTIVE: To compare complications, operating times, hospital stay, and esthetic results between both techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive study of patients undergoing HPS surgery between January 2010 and January 2020 was carried out. Qualitative variables (sex and complications) were expressed as absolute frequency and percentage, whereas quantitative variables (age at surgery, operating time, hospital stay, and scar esthetic assessment scales: MVSS [Modified Vancouver Scar Scale] and P-SAS [Patient Scar Assessment Scale]) were expressed as median and interquartile range.
RESULTS: 107 patients were analyzed: TSI (60.7%, n = 65) vs. TUI (39.3%, n = 42). Male patients: 89.2%, n = 58 vs. 83.3%, n = 35; age (days): 31 (24.5-39.5) vs. 34.5 (29.5-47.25); operating time (minutes): 41 (33.75-60) vs. 46 (38.5-60); and hospital stay (days): 2 (2-4) vs. 3 (2-3). Clavien-Dindo grade II complications were more frequent in the TUI Group (1.54%, n = 1 vs. 23.81%, n = 10; p <0.001), with most of them being wound infections. The opinion regarding the scar according to the MVSS scale was better in the TUI Group (1.5 [0-4] vs. 0 [0-2]; p = 0.022). No significant differences were found in the P-SAS scale (10 (6-18) vs. 6 (6-9); p = 0.060).
CONCLUSIONS: TUI is preferred from an esthetic point of view, and even though surgical wound infections are more frequent, it is not associated with longer operating times, longer hospital stay, or severe complications.
