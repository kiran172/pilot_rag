Title: Basal Coronary Microvascular Resistance Predicting Death and Heart Failure in Patients Without Functional Coronary Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Abnormal coronary microcirculation is linked to poor patient prognosis, so the aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic relevance of basal microvascular resistance (b-IMR) in patients without functional coronary stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Analyses of 226 patients who underwent intracoronary physiological assessment of the left anterior descending artery included primary endpoints of all-cause death and heart failure, as well as secondary endpoints of cardiovascular death and atherosclerotic vascular events. During a median follow-up of 2 years, there were 12 (5.3%) primary and 21 (9.3 %) secondary endpoints. The optimal b-IMR cutoff for the primary endpoints was 47.1 U. Kaplan-Meier curve analysis demonstrated worse event-free survival of the primary endpoints in patients with a b-IMR below the cutoff (χ2=21.178, P&lt;0.001). b-IMR was not significantly associated with the secondary endpoints (P=0.35). A low coronary flow reserve (CFR; &lt;2.5) had prognostic value for both endpoints (primary endpoints: χ2=11.401, P=0.001; secondary endpoints: (χ2=6.015; P=0.014), and high hyperemic microvascular resistance (≥25) was associated only with the secondary endpoints (χ2=4.420; P=0.036). Incorporating b-IMR into a clinical model that included CFR improved the Net Reclassification Index and Integrated Discrimination Improvement for predicting the primary endpoints (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.034, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: b-IMR may be a specific marker of the risk of death and heart failure in patients without functional coronary stenosis.
