Title: Troponin-Positive Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries and Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries: Definition, Etiologies, and Role of CT and MR Imaging.

Abstract: In approximately 10% of patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI), angiography does not reveal an obstructive coronary stenosis. This is known as myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA), which has complex and multifactorial causes. However, this term can be confusing and open to dual interpretation, because MINOCA is also used to describe patients with acute myocardial injury caused by ischemia-related myocardial necrosis. Therefore, with regards to this specific context of MINOCA, the generic term for MINOCA should be replaced with troponin-positive with non-obstructive coronary arteries (TpNOCA). The causes of TpNOCA can be subcategorized into epicardial coronary (causes of MINOCA), myocardial, and extracardiac disorders. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can confirm MI and differentiate various myocardial causes, while cardiac computed tomography is useful to diagnose the extracardiac causes.
