Title: Efficacy of closed cell self expandable metallic stent for peripheral arterial disease in the porcine iliac artery.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a closed-cell self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) with or without expanded-polytetrafluoroethylene (e-PTFE)-covering membrane in a porcine iliac artery model. Twelve Yorkshire domestic pigs were divided into a bare closed-cell SEMS (B-SEMS) group (n = 6) and covered closed-cell SEMS (C-SEMS) group (n = 6). Both closed-cell SEMSs were placed in the right or left iliac artery. Thrombogenicity score in the C-SEMS group was significantly higher than that in the B-SEMS group (p = 0.004) after 4 weeks. Angiographic findings of mean luminal diameters at 4 weeks follow-up did not differ significantly between B-SEMS and C-SEMS groups. Neointimal hyperplasia thickness as well as degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and collagen deposition in the C-SEMS group was significantly greater than that in the B-SEMS group (p < 0.001). Closed-cell SEMSs successfully maintained patency for 4 weeks without stent-related complications in the porcine iliac artery. Although mild thrombus with neointimal hyperplasia was observed in the C-SEMS group, subsequent occlusion, and in-stent stenosis did not occur in any of the pigs until the end of the study. Closed-cell SEMS with or without the e-PTFE covering membrane is effective and safe for the porcine iliac artery.
