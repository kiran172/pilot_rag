Title: Association Between Carotid Artery Perivascular Fat Density and Intraplaque Hemorrhage.

Abstract: Objectives: Perivascular adipose tissue plays a key role in atherosclerosis, but its effects on the composition of carotid atherosclerotic plaques are unknown. This study aimed to investigate the association between inflammatory carotid artery and intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) in the carotid artery. Methods: This is a single-center retrospective study. Carotid inflammation was assessed by perivascular fat density (PFD) in 72 participants (mean age, 65.1 years; 56 men) who underwent both computed tomography angiography (CTA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2 weeks. The presence of IPH was assessed with MRI. Carotid stenosis, maximum plaque thickness, calcification, and ulceration were evaluated through CTA. The association between PFD and the occurrence of IPH was studied using generalized estimating equations analysis. Results: Of 156 plaques, 72 plaques (46.2%) had IPH. Plaques with IPH showed higher PFD than those without [-41.4 ± 3.9 vs. -55.8 ± 6.5 Hounsfield unit (HU); p &lt; 0.001]. After age, calcification, degree of stenosis, maximum plaque thickness, and ulceration were adjusted for, PFD (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.41-2.73; p &lt; 0.001) was found to be strongly associated with the presence of IPH. Conclusions: A higher PFD is associated with the presence of IPH in the carotid artery. These findings may provide a novel marker to identify carotid IPH and risk stratification.
