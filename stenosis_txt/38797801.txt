Title: Remimazolam for general anesthesia in a patient with aortic stenosis and severe obesity undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is currently limited research on the clinical use of remimazolam in severely obese patients. In this report, we describe the anesthesia management of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in a severely obese patient using remimazolam.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 76-year-old woman (height 1.54 m; total body weight 104 kg; body mass index 43.9 kg/m2) was scheduled for TAVI via the femoral artery approach for aortic valve stenosis. Preoperative echocardiography showed an aortic valve peak flow of 4.0 m/s and an effective orifice area of 0.75 cm2. Anesthesia induction was performed with a bolus dose of 100 μg fentanyl, 15 mg remimazolam, 60 mg rocuronium, and a continuous infusion of remifentanil at 0.4 mg/h. Intraoperatively, remimazolam was administered at a rate of 35 mg/h. General anesthesia management was completed without any complications, although the patient required temporary catecholamine and inhalation anesthesia assistance due to hemodynamic changes.
CONCLUSION: Owing to its pharmacological advantages, remimazolam may be an option for anesthesia induction and maintenance in severely obese patients with unstable circulation.
