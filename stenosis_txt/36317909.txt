Title: Transapical Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Aortic Regurgitation in Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a popular treatment for surgical high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Recently, we have applied TAVI to the treatment of aortic regurgitation (AR). Compared with conventional surgical procedures, TAVI is less invasive and considered a useful option for these high-risk patients. In this study, we reported a patient who underwent transapical TAVI. The patient was a 52-year-old female with Takayasu arteritis (TA) for 25 years, as well as with severe aortic regurgitation, porcelain aortas, and heart failure. Transapical TAVI successfully was accomplished without neurological complications, and heart failure immediately improved postoperatively.
