Title: A novel balloon-expandable transcatheter aortic valve bioprosthesis: Myval and Myval Octacor.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Over the past two decades, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has expanded its application across all surgical risk levels, including low-risk patients, where, due to longer life expectancy, reducing common pitfalls of TAVR is essential. To address these needs, many technological advancements have been developed. Myval and the new generation Myval Octacor (Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd) are novel balloon-expandable (BE) transcatheter heart valve (THV) systems designed for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis.
AREAS COVERED: This review aims to illustrate the design features of these novel THVs and the main evidence from available studies. Furthermore, we provide evidence of these THVs' performance in challenging scenarios such as extra-large aortic annuli, bicuspid aortic valves, and valve-in-valve/valve-in-ring procedures.
EXPERT OPINION: Myval and Myval Octacor have demonstrated comparable early safety and clinical efficacy to the leading contemporary THVs, exhibiting remarkably low rates of moderate to severe paravalvular leak (PVL) and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI). The wide range of sizes offered by the Myval family may minimize the risk of under-/oversizing, potentially explaining the lower rates of the aforementioned phenomena. Moreover, the presence of both internal skirt and external reinforced cuff may also explain the low rate of moderate to severe PVL.
