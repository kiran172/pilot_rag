Abstract: Foreign body of the trachea and the bronchus are critical emergencies which can lead to life threatening complications. But the advent of the 2019 novel corona virus disease, pandemic has dramatically changed the comfort of these procedures since aerosol generating medical procedures pose a risk and spread of infection to the health care workers. Even the patients are uncomfortable visiting the hospital due to the fear of acquiring the COVID infection.A 41-year-old obese female with grade 4 subglottic stenosis status post tracheostomy presented with foreign body Fuller's tracheostomy tube flange in the right bronchus during the COVID 19 pandemic. The patient had delayed presentation to the hospital due to fear of getting exposed to COVID and poor access to health care facilities due to lockdown imposed in various places in the nation. The patient was tested for COVID and taken up for surgery where rigid bronchoscopy and foreign body removal was done via the tracheostoma. The details of the procedure, challenges faced during the procedure, the effect of the COVID pandemic on the patients and hospital staffs are discussed. The complications of the broken tracheostomy tube can be most efficiently dispelled by proper tube care by the attenders and frequent tube change.
