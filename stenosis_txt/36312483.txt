Title: Atypical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy presenting as acute coronary syndrome: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TS) is a rare acute cardiac disease with clinical features, symptoms, and electrocardiographic manifestations similar to those of acute myocardial infarction. We present the case of a patient with TS caused by a pheochromocytoma, which was confirmed by the postoperative pathology. Furthermore, we present the patient's subsequent management, treatment, and outcome.
CASE SUMMARY: A 64-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with episodic chest pain and palpitations, electrocardiogram (ECG) findings suggestive of high lateral wall myocardial infarction, echocardiogram showing left ventricular wall segmental motion abnormalities, and elevated levels of the myocardial marker troponin. The patient underwent coronary angiography, which revealed unobstructed blood flow without obvious stenosis. During their hospitalization, the patient had paroxysmal elevation of blood pressure accompanied by palpitations and profuse sweating, with elevated blood catecholamine levels during seizures. Subsequent computerized tomography of the adrenal glands revealed the presence of a nodule in the right adrenal, which was resected and determined to be an adrenal pheochromocytoma. Therefore, the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma-induced atypical TS was made. The patient had an uneventful postoperative recovery.
CONCLUSION: Cardiologists should consider pheochromocytoma in patients with TS. Early detection allows timely intervention, benefiting patients.
