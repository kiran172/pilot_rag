Title: Outcomes of Holmium Laser, Cryoablation, and Budesonide Inhalation for Treating Severe Central Airway Stenosis in Infants.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Central airway stenosis (CAS) in infants is characterized by dysphonia, dyspnea, cyanosis, repeated apnea, and infection. This case series study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of holmium laser, cryoablation and budesonide inhalation in treating infants with severe CAS.
METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed medical records data of 28 infants with severe CAS who underwent holmium laser treatment with cryoablation and/or balloon dilatation and budesonide inhalation therapy at Shanghai Children's Medical Center between June 2014 and May 2020. Outcomes were defined as treatment success when the stenotic area was <25% for the normal age group with stable reopening diameter at one-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 12.8 ± 8.8 months and 17 (60%) were male. Sixteen cases had web-like stenosis and 12 had scar contracture stenosis. Among 16 patients with web-like stenosis, 8 (50%) underwent balloon dilation with cryotherapy and 8 (50%) underwent balloon dilation only; treatment success was achieved in 10 (62.5%) cases and after revised treatments in 5 (31.25%) cases. Among 12 patients with scar contracture stenosis, 6 (50%) underwent balloon dilation with cryotherapy, 4 (33.3%) underwent cryotherapy and 2 (16.7%) underwent balloon dilation only; treatment success was achieved in 3 (23.1%) cases and after 1-4 revised treatments in 8 (61.5%) cases. Symptoms of the 2 unsuccessful (7.1%) cases were relieved after tracheal stent insertion. Neither severe adverse events nor complications were observed during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Holmium laser with cryoablation followed by budesonide inhalation therapy safely and effectively cleans stenotic tissues and maintains airway reopening. Balloon dilation after holmium laser is recommended for treating web-like stenosis.
