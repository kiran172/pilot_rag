Title: Usefulness of non-slip element percutaneous transluminal angioplasty scoring balloons in treating severe calcified lesions of the carotid artery for carotid artery stenting: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Treatment of calcified lesions with conventional angioplasty balloons can be difficult due to insufficient lumen expansion, high dissection rates, and repeated revascularization. We report a case in which a scoring balloon was used in lesions resistant to angioplasty with a semi-compliant balloon.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 72-year-old man presented with severe stenosis and a highly calcified lesion in the right cervical internal carotid artery. Right carotid artery stenting (CAS) was planned to prevent future ischemic stroke events. Conventional semi-compliant balloon angioplasty was unsuccessful. Three inflations of a non-slip element (NSE) percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) scoring balloon (Nipro, Osaka, Japan) successfully achieved CAS without complications.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report to describe the use of this scoring balloon in de novo carotid artery disease. NSE PTA scoring balloon catheters can be a useful option for refractory, highly calcified stenosis.
