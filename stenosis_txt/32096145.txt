Title: Diagnostic Value of Virtual Bronchoscopic Navigation in the Bronchial Tuberculosis Induced Central Airway Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Electronic bronchoscopy is invasive and may cause pain. This study aimed to explore the clinical value of virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) in the diagnosis of benign central airway stenosis (CAS) secondary to tracheobronchial tuberculosis (TBT).
METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with benign CAS caused by TBT were recruited between July 2015 and December 2017. The location, length and diameter of stenoses were independently determined by VBN and electronic bronchoscopy (EOB), and the sensitivity and specificity of VBN in identifying stenosis were assessed with EOB as the gold standard.
RESULTS: In 68 patients with TBT, the overall coincidence between EOB and VBN in the identification of stenosis was 100%. A total of 188 sites were selected from the central airway, and the stenosis was graded into 0%, ≤ 25%, 26-50%, 51-75%, 76-90% and > 90%. The sensitivity of VBN in determining the degree of stenosis was 98.45%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 100.00%, 84.62% and 0.00%, respectively; the specificity was 91.53%, 96.07%, 97.09%, 97.08%, 97.14% and 97.30%, respectively; the accuracy rate was 96.28%, 96.28%, 97.34%, 97.34%, 96.28% and 95.7%, respectively. The length of airway stenosis on EOB was divided into < 10 mm, 10-30 mm, 30-50 mm and > 50 mm. There was no significant difference in the length of airway stenosis between VBN and EOB (t = 0.083, P = 0.936; t = 1.340, P = 0.199; t = 1.297, P = 0.216; t = 2.186, P = 0.081). In three patients who received stent placement, VBN was able to accurately assess the postoperative expansion.
CONCLUSION: VBN is helpful for the diagnosis of TBT-induced CBS and may provide important information on the location, length, diameter and cross-sectional area of stenosis for further EOB examination and interventional therapy. VBN is recommended for patients with TBT and those with contradictions to bronchoscopy, as well as for regular follow-up of stable TBT, because it reduces the incidence of injury, avoids repeat operations and shortens treatment time.
