Title: Late Outcomes of Konno-Rastan and Modified Konno for Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Obstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: While early outcomes of the Konno-Rastan and modified Konno procedures are known, long-term outcomes remain undetermined. Our objective was to examine long-term clinical and echocardiographic outcomes.
METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of patients undergoing Konno-Rastan and modified Konno for complex left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction from January 1980 to January 2021. The Ross-Konno procedure was excluded due to its often limited ventriculotomy.
RESULTS: A total of 92 patients were identified: 73 Konno-Rastan and 19 modified Konno. The modified Konno group was significantly younger (median [interquartile range, IQR]: 6, [2-12] years vs 16 [9-32] years, P = .001). LVOT obstruction was multilevel (39 of 92 [42.4%]), tunnel subaortic (35 of 92 [38.0%]), or aortic valve stenosis/annular hypoplasia (18 of 92 [19.6%]). Shone syndrome was present in 20 of 92 (21.7%) patients. Operative mortality was 7 of 92 (7.6%); 4 of 86 (4.7%) in elective vs 3 of 6 (50.0%) in urgent cases (P = .005). Median follow-up was 12 (IQR, 5-22) years. Aortic valve/LVOT mean gradient was 13 (IQR, 10-18) mm Hg at 1 year but gradually increased to 25 (IQR, 13-46) mm Hg at 10 years. Ejection fraction remained normal. Freedom from reoperation at 5 and 10 years was 77.2% and 58.4% among Konno-Rastan and 57.7% and 41.7% among modified Konno patients (P = .28), respectively. Overall survival at 5, 10, and 15 years was 82.9%, 76.3%, and 65.5%. Risk factors for mortality included older age, New York Heart Association class III/IV, longer cardiopulmonary bypass time, and multilevel LVOT obstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: While LVOT obstruction is alleviated early, recurrent LVOT obstruction occurs over time after Konno-Rastan and modified Konno procedures. Additionally, despite preserved left ventricular systolic function, late overall survival is poor in this young population.
