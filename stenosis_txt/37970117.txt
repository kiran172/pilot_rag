Title: Epidemiology of low back pain: frequency, risk factors, and patterns in South-South Nigeria.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Low back pain (LBP) is a prevalent musculoskeletal condition that poses significant public health challenges. However, its epidemiology in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially in rural settings, remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to determine the epidemiology of LBP in a Nigerian Teaching Hospital.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a retrospective review of the records of all LBP cases seen at the rheumatology clinic from 2018 to 2022 in a Teaching Hospital in South-South Nigeria. The sociodemographic and clinical data, including disability scores, was extracted from the patients' medical records. The data was analyzed using IBM SPSS version 25, and the level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.
RESULTS: Among 1,580 patients, 319 (20.2%) reported LBP. The mean age was 59.51 Â±10.21, and the peak age incidence was 51-60 years. Low back pain was more prevalent in females (61.4%). Work-related factors (47.3%) such as heavy lifting (26.3%), prolonged sitting (19.4%), and poor posture (27.9%) were the prominent risk factors. Sedentary behavior (11.5%) and obesity (16.9%) contributed. Common clinical manifestations included difficulty standing or bending (73%), walking difficulties (67.7%), sleep disturbances (51.4%), and radicular pain (45.8%). Common etiologies were spondylosis (66.5%), spondylolisthesis (22.3%), disc prolapse (19.4%), spinal canal stenosis (15.4%), muscle spasm (12.2%), and tuberculous spondylitis (9.7%). Acute and chronic LBP constituted 12.2% and 79.9% of cases, respectively. In terms of disability, 33.5% had minimal, 44.5% had moderate, 15.4% had severe, and 6.6% had crippling disabilities.
CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical causes were the most implicated in LBP. Work-related factors and lifestyle choices contribute to the occurrence of LBP. Adjusting posture and lifestyle modification reduces LBP risk. Understanding its epidemiology is crucial for optimizing care and implementing preventive strategies.
