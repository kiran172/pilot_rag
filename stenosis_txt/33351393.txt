Title: [Experience with 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring in follow-up of patients with aortic coartacion in a pediatric hospital].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Hypertension (HTA) is an important comorbidity in children with aortic coarctation (COAO) and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) allows an accurate diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: Describe the prevalence of HTA in the office and its recategorization with ABPM
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive, observational, retrospective study; It included children between 4 and 18 years with COAO who performed ABPM. PA was registered in the office and ABPM, echocardiogram and medication.
RESULTS: 33 patients, 26 men, age 10.2 Â± 3.8 years, By PA in the office: 22 normotensive; 8 HTA controlled; 2 preHTA; 1 HTA not medicated. With 32 complete MAP records, they were categorized: normotensive 11, preHTA 7, nocturnal HTA 3, masked HTA 4; HTA controlled 3; Uncontrolled HTA 3 and 1 HTA.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension in this population in the office was low. The ABPM recategorized and detected nocturnal HTA and masked HTA.
