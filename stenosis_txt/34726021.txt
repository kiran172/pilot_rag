Title: [Influence of degenerative scoliosis on the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis by MIS-TLIF].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of degenerative scoliosis on the difficulty and efficacy of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion(MIS-TLIF) in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.
METHODS: From September 2016 to September 2019, 52 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis treated by MIS-TLIF were retrospectively analyzed, including 16 males and 36 females, aged from 42 to 71(63.44±5.96) years old, the course of disease from 1.5 to 6.5 years, with an average of (3.69±1.10) years. All patients had lower extremity root pain or numbness, 41 patients had intermittent claudication. There were 31 cases of L<sub>4, 5</sub> and 21 cases of L<sub>5</sub>S<sub>1</sub>. There were 18 cases in scoliosis group, lumbar spinal stenosis combined withdegenerative scoliosis, and 34 cases in stenosis group, lumbar spinal stenosis alone. The perioperative data and postoperative complications were recorded, the postoperative interbody fusion was evaluated by CT, and the clinical outcomes were evaluated by VAS score, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
RESULTS: All patients were followed up for 12 to 36 months, with an average of (19.58±5.33) months. The operation time and intraoperative bleeding in stenosis group were better than those in scoliosis group (P&lt;0.05). There were no significant differences in postoperative drainage volume, postoperative Hb, CRP, postoperative landing time, discharge time, VAS score at discharge and follow-up, ODI score at 3 months and follow up, postoperative complications and interbody fusion rate between two groups (P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: For patients with lumbar spinal stenosis undergoing MIS-TLIF, degenerative scoliosis can lead to prolonged operation time and increased bleeding. However, it has no significant effect on therelief of postoperative symptoms, postoperative complications and the recovery of lumbar function.
