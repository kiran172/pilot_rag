Title: Impact of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation on Severe Gastrointestinal Bleeding in Patients With Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: To investigate the effectiveness of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for resolving gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) in patients with severe GIB and severe aortic stenosis. This was an observational study of consecutive TAVI procedures from 2011 to 2018, identified through a prospectively maintained institutional database. Patients with severe GIB defined as abnormal hemoglobin/hematocrit and overt bleeding or positive fecal occult blood test. Groups were compared for differences in baseline clinical and procedural characteristics and post-TAVI outcomes. A total of 1,192 patients who underwent TAVI were identified, of which 164 patients (13.8%) were found to have had severe GIB. Society of Thoracic Surgeons-Predicted Risk of Mortality scores were higher in the severe GIB group than in the non-GIB group (8.8 ± 5.3 vs 7.6 ± 4.5, p = 0.002). The 30-day mortality was similar across each group (p >0.05), with overall 30-day mortality being 3.2% (38 of 1,192) for the entire cohort. Of the 164 TAVIs with severe GIB, 130 (79.3%) had resolution of their GIB after their TAVI. Patients without resolution of their GIB had higher aortic valve mean pressure gradients after their TAVI (15.0 ± 5.3 vs 9.0 ± 4.3). In conclusion, TAVI was associated with substantial reductions in severe GIB. Despite higher baseline risk, patients with severe GIB achieved similar outcomes, including 30-day mortality, compared with patients without GIB. TAVI may be a safe and effective treatment for patients with severe aortic stenosis and severe GIB, whereas persistently high transvalvular pressure gradients after TAVI may be related to the likelihood of recurrent GIB.
