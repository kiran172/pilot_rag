Title: Isolated middle cerebral artery stenosis caused by syphilitic vasculitis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Syphilitic vasculitis (SV) is rare and difficult to be diagnosed. High-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (HR-VWI) might be valuable in the diagnosis by differentiating SV from other vessel wall pathologies.
METHODS: We report a rare case with severe isolated middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis and cerebral infarction, which was evaluated by serial HR-VWI.
RESULTS: A 46-year-old woman presented with an acute infarct in the left basal ganglia and severe isolated stenosis in left middle cerebral artery (MCA). Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis was performed and the findings were consistent with neurosyphilis diagnosis. The MCA stenosis was also suspected to be the result of SV. HR-VWI revealed the evidence of concentric thickening and circular uniform enhancement of the arterial wall. After two cycles of anti-syphilis treatment, subsequent HR-VWI showed that the MCA stenosis was reduced significantly except slight enhancement of the arterial wall, which confirmed that the SV caused the isolated MCA stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: HR-VWI could be an important diagnostic tool for isolated middle cerebral artery stenosis caused by SV, which could serve as a biomarker for assessing the response to anti-syphilis treatment in the future.
