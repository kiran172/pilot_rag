Title: PICC insertion and veins of the arm size variation during dialysis treatment: A prospective observational study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peripherally Inserted Central Catheters play an increasingly important role in Central Venous Access Devices. However, the use of these devices should be carefully considered in specific situations such as central catheterisation in patients with chronic kidney disease. When evaluating the feasibility of placement for a patient undergoing dialysis, the relationship between changes in circulating volume before and after dialysis treatment, and potential variations in the size of deep veins in the upper limbs, should be considered.
MATERIALS: Upper limb veins, specifically the basilic or brachial veins, were identified and measured before and after dialysis treatment. Patient data and weight loss data during dialysis treatment were also collected. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the correlation between the variables.
RESULTS: The average variation in vein size for the entire sample was +0.17 ± 0.43 mm. The mean volume removed was 2.2 ± 0.8 l. In subgroup 1 (fluid volume loss <2000 ml), the population experienced a decrease in the measured vein size after dialysis. In subgroup 2 (fluid volume loss ⩾2000 ml), the population experienced an increase in the measured vein size after dialysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Upper arm vascular access placement in dialysed patients with fluid removal of less than 2000 ml should be performed after the dialysis session. Conversely, in dialysed patients with fluid removal of more than 2000 ml, where a significant increase in vein size was observed, vascular access placement should be performed before the dialysis session when the veins are smaller. Additionally, it should be noted that in patients with chronic kidney disease, the venous system of the upper limbs should be preserved as much as possible to prevent thrombosis and stenosis in potential arteriovenous fistula creation.
