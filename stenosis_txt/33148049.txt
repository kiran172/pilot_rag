Title: Ophthalmic adverse effects of taxanes: The Mayo Clinic experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate ophthalmic side effects of taxanes and compare side effect frequency, requirement for cessation of taxane therapy, visual acuity outcome, and concurrent systemic effects between paclitaxel and docetaxel.
METHODS: Patients taking taxanes at a single center from 1/1/2010 to 2/29/2020 were retrospectively reviewed for clinical characteristics, treatments, and concurrent systemic adverse effects.
RESULTS: Of 1918 patients, 22 (1.1%) experienced an ophthalmic side effect that came to the attention of an eye care provider. Mean age at presentation of the side effect was 62 years (median 66, range 23-82). The most common side effect was meibomian gland dysfunction in 5 (23%) patients, followed by cystoid macular edema in 4 (18%) patients and canalicular obstruction in 4 (18%) patients, followed by diplopia in 2 (9%) patients, and singular cases of lash alopecia, and blepharitis, among others. Lids/lashes as well as nasolacrimal duct adverse effects occurred more frequently with docetaxel therapy than with paclitaxel therapy. Follow-up was available in 10 (45%) patients, with mean duration of 5 months (median 4, range 0-12 months). Of these patients, the ophthalmic side effects were resolved or controlled without discontinuing therapy in 8 (80%) patients. Taxane cessation was required in one patient with docetaxel-related canalicular obstruction and one patient with paclitaxel-related cystoid macular edema.
CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic taxane-related adverse events are rare with estimated frequency of ophthalmic side effects of about 1%. Nevertheless, it is important that ophthalmologists recognize the range of side effects for optimal management. Most ophthalmic events can be treated with targeted therapy without discontinuation of life-prolonging taxane therapy.
