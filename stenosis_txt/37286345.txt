Title: Recurrence of syncope after valve replacement in severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The recurrence of syncope after valve intervention in severe aortic stenosis (SAS) and its impact on outcome are unknown. We hypothesised that syncope on exertion will disappear after intervention, whereas syncope at rest might recur. Our aim has been to describe the recurrence of syncope in patients with SAS undergoing valve replacement and its impact on mortality.
METHODS: Double-centre observational registry of 320 consecutive patients with symptomatic SAS without other valve disease and/or coronary artery disease who underwent valve intervention and were discharged alive. All-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality were considered events.
RESULTS: 53 patients (median age 81 years, 28 men) had syncope (29 on exertion, 21 at rest, 3 unknown). Clinical and echocardiographic variables were similar in patients with and without syncope (median v<sub>max</sub> 4.44 m/s, mean gradient 47 mm Hg, valve area 0.7 cm2, left ventricular ejection fraction 62%). After a median follow-up of 69 months (IQR: 55-88), syncope on exertion did not recur in any patient. In contrast, 8 of the 21 patients with syncope at rest had postintervention syncope at rest (38%; p&lt;0.001): 3 needed a pacemaker, 3 were neuromediated or hypotensive and 2 arrhythmic. Only recurrence of syncope was associated with cardiovascular mortality (HR 5.74; 95% CI 2.17 to 15.17; p&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Syncope on exertion in patients with SAS did not recur after aortic valve intervention. Syncope at rest recurs in a high proportion of patients and identifies a population with increased mortality. According to our results, syncope at rest should be thoroughly evaluated before proceeding to aortic valve intervention.
