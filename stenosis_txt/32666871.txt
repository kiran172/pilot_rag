Title: Six-Month Outcomes From the First-in-Human, Single-Arm SELUTION Sustained-Limus-Release Drug-Eluting Balloon Trial in Femoropopliteal Lesions.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the novel SELUTION sustained-limus-release (SLR) drug-eluting balloon (DEB) in the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions. Materials and Methods: Between October 2016 and May 2017, 50 subjects (mean age 69.6±10.4 years; 29 men) with symptomatic moderate to severe lower limb ischemia (Rutherford categories 2 or 3) were enrolled at 4 German centers for the SELUTION SLR first-in-human trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02941224). The SELUTION SLR utilizes micro-reservoirs (biodegradable polymer spheres containing sirolimus) embedded within an amphipathic membrane coated onto an angioplasty balloon. The biodegradable reservoirs are transferred to the target vessel lumen during brief balloon inflation. The primary trial objective was comparison of angiographic late lumen loss at 6 months against an objective performance criterion (OPC) value of 1.04 mm for uncoated balloon angioplasty. Secondary endpoints included device, procedural, and clinical success; clinical and imaging assessments of primary patency and restenosis; functional assessments including Rutherford category and ankle-brachial index (ABI); and major adverse events [composite of cardiovascular mortality, index limb amputation, target limb thrombosis, and clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR)]. Results: At 6 months, median angiographic late lumen loss following SELUTION SLR treatment was 0.19 mm (range -1.16 to 3.07). Mean angiographic late lumen loss (n=34) was 0.29±0.84 mm (95% CI -0.01 to 0.58), significantly lower than the 1.04-mm OPC value (p&lt;0.001). The rate of primary patency by duplex ultrasound was 88.4%, and freedom from angiographic binary restenosis was 91.2%. Through 6 months, there was significant improvement over baseline in Rutherford categories (p&lt;0.001) and in ABI measurements (p&lt;0.001). A single case (2%) of CD-TLR occurred at 5 months. There were no other major adverse events. Conclusion: Through 6 months, the SELUTION SLR DEB appears to inhibit restenosis effectively and safely, improving outcomes in subjects with symptomatic femoropopliteal disease.
