Title: Melody transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement: a single-center case series in Southeast Asia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies of transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement (TPVR) with the Melody valve have demonstrated good clinical and hemodynamic outcomes. Our study analyzes the midterm clinical and hemodynamic outcomes for patients who underwent Melody valve implantation in Southeast Asia.
METHODS: Patients with circumferential conduits or bioprosthetic valves and experiencing post-operative right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) dysfunction were recruited for Melody TPVR.
RESULTS: Our cohort (n = 14) was evenly divided between pediatric and adult patients. The median age was 19 years (8-38 years), a male-to-female ratio of 6:1 with a median follow-up period of 48 months (16-79 months), and the smallest patient was an 8-year-old boy weighing 18 kg. All TPVR procedures were uneventful and successful with no immediate mortality or conduit rupture. The primary implant indication was combined stenosis and regurgitation. The average conduit diameter was 21 ± 2.3 mm. Concomitant pre-stenting was done in 71.4% of the patients without Melody valve stent fractures (MSFs). Implanted valve size included 22-mm (64.3%), 20-mm (14.3%), and 18-mm (21.4%). After TPVR, the mean gradient across the RVOT was significantly reduced from 41 mmHg (10-48 mmHg) to 16 mmHg (6-35 mmHg) at discharge, p < 0.01. Late follow-up infective endocarditis (IE) was diagnosed in 2 patients (14.3%). Overall freedom from IE was 86% at 79 months follow-up. Three patients (21.4%) developed progressive RVOT gradients.
CONCLUSION: For patients in Southeast Asia with RVOT dysfunction, Melody TPVR outcomes are similar to those reported for patients in the US in terms of hemodynamic and clinical improvements. A pre-stenting strategy was adopted and no MSFs were observed. Post-implantation residual stenosis and progressive stenosis of the RVOT require long term monitoring and reintervention. Lastly, IE remained a concern despite vigorous prevention and peri-procedural bacterial endocarditis prophylaxis.
