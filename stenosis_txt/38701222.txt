Title: Initial clinical experience with the balloon-in-basket pulsed field ablation system: acute results of the VOLT CE mark feasibility study.

Abstract: AIMS: Pulsed field ablation (PFA) for the treatment of atrial fibrillation (AF) potentially offers improved safety and procedural efficiencies compared with thermal ablation. Opportunities remain to improve effective circumferential lesion delivery, safety, and workflow of first-generation PFA systems. In this study, we aim to evaluate the initial clinical experience with a balloon-in-basket, 3D integrated PFA system with a purpose-built form factor for pulmonary vein (PV) isolation.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The VOLT CE Mark Study is a pre-market, prospective, multi-centre, single-arm study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Volt™ PFA system for the treatment of paroxysmal (PAF) or persistent AF (PersAF). Feasibility sub-study subjects underwent phrenic nerve evaluation, endoscopy, chest computed tomography, and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. Study endpoints were the rate of primary serious adverse event within 7 days and acute procedural effectiveness. A total of 32 subjects (age 61.6 ± 9.6 years, 65.6% male, 84.4% PAF) were enrolled and treated in the feasibility sub-study and completed a 30-day follow-up. Acute effectiveness was achieved in 99.2% (127/128) of treated PVs (96.9% of subjects, 31/32) with 23.8 ± 4.2 PFA applications/subject. Procedure, fluoroscopy, LA dwell, and transpired ablation times were 124.6 ± 28.1, 19.8 ± 8.9, 53.0 ± 21.0, and 48.0 ± 19.9 min, respectively. Systematic assessments of initial safety revealed no phrenic nerve injury, pulmonary vein stenosis, or oesophageal lesions causally related to the PFA system and three subjects with silent cerebral lesions (9.4%). There were no primary serious adverse events.
CONCLUSION: The initial clinical use of the Volt PFA System demonstrates acute safety and effectiveness in the treatment of symptomatic, drug refractory AF.
