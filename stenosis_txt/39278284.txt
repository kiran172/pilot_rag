Title: More efficient endoscopic submucosal dissection with deep endotracheal intubation for superficial cervical esophageal carcinoma: a dual-center, prospective, randomized controlled study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Deep endotracheal intubation (DET) has been proposed to improve cervical esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) because of the limited space and visibility. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of DET.
METHODS: In the current dual-center trial, patients were randomized into DET or conventional endotracheal intubation (CET) groups. Complete resection rate, operation time, and adverse events were measured and compared.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients (60 lesions) were assigned to the groups, showing comparable baseline characteristics. The complete resection rates were similarly high in both groups. However, DET significantly reduced ESD operation time (52.2 minutes vs 71.1 minutes, P < .001) and postoperative pain scores (3.1 vs 4.7, P < .01). Severe stenosis occurred more frequently in the CET patients (20% vs 0%, P = .035). No significant differences were observed in other adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS: DET can overcome technical challenges to improve therapeutic efficiency and safety. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT06420258.).
