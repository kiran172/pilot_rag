Title: Contralateral approach to transverse-sigmoid sinus stenting.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endovascular dural venous sinus stenting (DVSS) has emerged as a safe and effective therapy for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) in patients with transverse-sinus stenosis associated with an elevated mean pressure gradient (MPG). The typical antegrade approach, jugular to sigmoid to transverse, is not always technically feasible due to the degree of stenosis and other anatomic factors. To this point, there has been no reported cases of contralateral DVSS. We describe four cases of DVSS from a contralateral transverse-sigmoid sinus approach.
METHODS: We describe 4 patients presenting with symptoms of IIH between 2019 and 2020 who we treated with contralateral transverse-sigmoid sinus stenting. Cases were reviewed for clinical data including initial presenting symptoms, devices used, other attempted IIH treatments, and follow up symptoms.
RESULTS: Four female patients were identified and treated under general endotracheal anesthesia. Stenoses measured 72%, 78%, 67%, and 70% with MPGs across the transverse-sigmoid sinus of 19, 16, 9 and 13 mmHg, respectively. Post-stenting MPGs were 1, 0, 1 and 1 mmHg, respectively. Three patients had complete resolution of symptoms and 1 had partial resolution. No complications occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: This case series demonstrates successful transverse-sigmoid sinus stenting from the contralateral dural sinus and provides an alternative approach to DVSS in patients with IIH.
