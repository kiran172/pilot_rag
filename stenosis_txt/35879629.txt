Title: Peak systolic myocardial velocity in patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis: prognostic value and natural course.

Abstract: Myocardial systolic longitudinal function has been known to decrease in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Preoperative peak systolic myocardial velocity at the septal mitral valve annulus (S'), measured using Doppler tissue imaging, was used as an indicator for myocardial systolic longitudinal function. The prognostic value and natural course of S' after surgical aortic valve replacement for severe AS have not been elucidated. This retrospective observational study included patients from January 2006 to December 2018. The patients were divided to 2 groups (pre-S'<sub>HIGH</sub> vs. pre-S'<sub>LOW</sub>) with a cut-off 5.4 cm/s of preoperative S' (pre-S') that was identified by restricted cubic spline curve. The primary outcome was postoperative long-term all-cause mortality. Nine hundred and five patients were analyzed. All-cause mortality rate at the median follow-up period of 5.2 years was 12% in pre-S'<sub>LOW</sub> and 8% in pre-S'<sub>HIGH</sub>. Multivariate analysis showed that pre-S'<sub>LOW</sub> was associated with an increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio, 1.60; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.48; P = 0.032). Significantly different trajectories of postoperative S' (post-S') were found between two groups (P &lt; 0.001 for difference): In pre-S'<sub>LOW</sub>, post-S' increased within 6 months after surgery, and gradually decreased over time, whereas it slowly decreased up to 5 years after surgery and then reached a plateau in pre-S'<sub>HIGH.</sub> The difference in pre-S' level maintained over time, and remained consistent in the adjusted analysis. Pre-S' &lt; 5.4 cm/s was found to be associated with an increased long-term all-cause mortality. In addition, the trajectories for post-S' were different according to pre-S', which remained after adjustment.
