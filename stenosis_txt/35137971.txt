Title: Peripheral access size evaluation in transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: Peripheral access vessel dimensions in the general patient population screened for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) can offer insight into the indications for pre-TAVR computed tomography angiography (CTA) assessment. We seek to determine peripheral access vessel sizes in patients screened for TAVR and association with patient characteristics.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis screened for TAVR at a high-volume center from April 2012 to March 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. For each patient, contrast-enhanced CTA was used to determine the minimal luminal diameters (MLDs) of the transfemoral access vessels, as measured between the inguinal ligament and the deep femoral artery for the femoral artery, and proximal to the inguinal ligament for the external and common iliac arteries, respectively. Paired and independent samples t-tests were used to compare means and regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with MLD.
RESULTS: A total of 1049 screened patients were included of which 826 (78.7%) underwent TAVR and 551 (52.5%) were male. The mean age was 80.6 (±9.6) years and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 26.7 (±5.9) kg/m2 . About 152 (14.5%) had peripheral vascular disease and 153 (14.6%) had chronic kidney disease. The mean (±2 standard deviations) MLDs of the right and left femoral arteries were 7.73 mm (4.68-10.78) and 7.68 mm (4.63-10.72), respectively. Male sex and BMI were associated with larger average femoral MLD while hyperlipidemia, hypertension, smoking, peripheral vascular disease, and coronary artery disease were inversely associated.
CONCLUSION: Most patients screened for TAVR have minimum peripheral access vessel sizes exceeding the recommended minimum access route diameters of modern transcatheter heart valves. As sheath sizes decrease, clinicians must carefully judge patient individual risk factors to determine whether a pre-TAVR CTA assessing peripheral access vessel dimensions and anatomical contraindications is indicated. Larger studies and randomized controlled trials are required to compare the outcomes of TAVR with and without preoperative CTA.
