Title: Impact of intensively lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol on deferred lesion prognosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intensively lowered low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level on the deferred lesion prognosis after revascularization deferral based on fractional flow reserve (FFR).
BACKGROUND: Lowering LDL-C is associated with lower cardiovascular event rate, but its benefit on the deferred lesion prognosis has not been well evaluated.
METHODS: This retrospective, single-center, observational study analyzed 192 deferred lesions with FFR value >0.80 in 192 patients with stable coronary artery disease. According to the first follow-up LDL-C level, they were assigned to the LOW group (<70 mg/dL) or the HIGH group (≥70 mg/dL). Deferred lesion failure (DLF) was defined as the composite of deferred lesion revascularization and deferred vessel myocardial infarction.
RESULTS: Of all participants, 61 and 131 patients were assigned to the LOW and the HIGH group, respectively. During the median follow-up of 2.8 years, DLF occurred in 1 and 14 patients in the LOW group and the HIGH group (1.6% and 10.7%, log-rank p = .043), respectively. The incidence of any unplanned revascularization was also significantly lower in the LOW group than in the HIGH group (3.3% vs. 14.5%, log-rank p = .032).
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of DLF was significantly lower in the patients with LDL-C < 70 mg/dL than in those with LDL-C ≥ 70 mg/dL at the first follow-up after FFR-based deferral of revascularization.
