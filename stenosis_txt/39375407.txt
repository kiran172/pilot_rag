Title: GAN-Augmented Na誰ve Bayes for identifying high-risk coronary artery disease patients using CT angiography data.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the most common cardiovascular disorders affecting millions of individuals globally. It is the leading cause of mortality in both the wealthy and impoverished nations. CAD patients exhibit a wide range of symptoms, some of which are not evident until a major incident occurs. The development of techniques for early detection and precise diagnosis is heavily dependent on research. The proposed system introduces a novel approach, Generative Adversarial Networks Augmented Na誰ve Bayes (GAN-ANB), to classify high-risk CAD patients using Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) imaging data. The database included images from Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) records of 5,000 individuals. The developed GAN framework consists of a generator to generate synthetic patient profiles, and a discriminator to distinguish between genuine and synthetic profiles to improve the identification of high-risk CAD patients. Adding synthetic data to the training process allowed the discriminator to be utilized further to improve predictive modeling. The performance of the GAN-enhanced prediction model was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC). The model exhibited an outstanding Dice Similarity Coefficient (0.91), Mean Intersection Over Union (0.90), recall (0.96), and precision (0.98) in differentiating between high-risk and low-risk individuals. The identification of high-risk patients with CAD is greatly enhanced by the integration of GANs with clinical and imaging data. ROC of 0.99 was achieved by the GAN-ANB model, which outperformed conventional machine learning models, was achieved using the GAN-ANB model. High cholesterol level, diabetes, and some CCTA-derived imaging characteristics, including plaque load and luminal stenosis, were among the major predictors. This method offers a powerful tool for early diagnosis and intervention, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes and lower healthcare expenditure.
