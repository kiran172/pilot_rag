Title: Superficial Spread of Nonkeratinizing Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Cervix to the Endometrium: A Case Report.

Abstract: Squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) are the most prevalent malignant tumors affecting the cervix. The superficial spread of SCC along the inner surface of the uterus, replacing the endometrium with malignant cells, is a rare subtype of cervical cancer. We present the case of a 55-year-old woman who complained of per-vaginal white discharge and generalized weakness for one month. Clinical examination revealed a bulky and fibrosed cervical os. A cervical biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of poorly differentiated nonkeratinizing SCC. MRI showed an endocervical infiltrative, heterogeneously enhancing mass lesion involving the cervix, along with cervical stenosis and hydrometra. Irregular thickening with nodular enhancing deposits showing morphology similar to the cervical lesion and restricted diffusion were noted along the endometrial lining contiguous with the cervical lesion. The patient underwent a radical hysterectomy, and histopathological examination revealed poorly differentiated nonkeratinizing squamous cell cervical carcinoma with contiguous squamous cell extension into the uterine endometrium, confirming the diagnosis of superficially spreading cervical SCC. Establishing the continuity of the lesion on imaging and histopathological testing is critical to confirm the presence of a superficial spread of cervical cancer and rule out contemporaneous endometrial cancer.
