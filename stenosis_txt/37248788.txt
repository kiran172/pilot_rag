Title: Infectious complications associated with bronchial anastomotic dehiscence in lung transplant recipients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Bronchial anastomotic dehiscence (AD) is an uncommon complication following lung transplantation that carries significant morbidity and mortality. The objective of this study was to characterize fungal and bacterial infections in ADs, including whether infections following AD were associated with progression to bronchial stenosis.
METHODS: This was a single-center study of 615 lung transplant recipients between 6/1/2015 and 12/31/2021. Airway complications were defined according to ISHLT consensus guidelines.
RESULTS: 22 of the 615 recipients (3.6%) developed an AD. Bronchial ischemia or necrosis was common prior to dehiscence (68.1%). Fourteen (63.6%) recipients had bacterial airway infections, most commonly with Gram-negative rods, prior to dehiscence. Thirteen (59.1%) recipients had an associated pleural infection, most commonly with Candida species (30.8%). Post-dehiscence Aspergillus species were isolated in 4 recipients, 3 of which were de novo infections. Eleven had bacterial infections prior to dehiscence resolution, most commonly with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Eleven recipients developed airway stenosis requiring dilation and/or stenting. Development of secondary infection prior to AD resolution was not associated with progression to stenosis (OR = .41, 95% CI = .05-3.30, p = .41).
CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacterial infections are common before and after AD. Pleural infection should be suspected in most cases. Infections prior to healing were not associated with subsequent development of airway stenosis.
