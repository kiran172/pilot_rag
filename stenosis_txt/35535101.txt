Title: Hepatic Artery Vasospasm Masquerading as Hepatic Artery Thrombosis in a Case of Deceased Donor Liver Transplant.

Abstract: Hepatic arterial vasospasm can be a potential vascular complication after liver transplantation and can manifest as hepatic artery thrombosis. Due to the scarcity of literature on this pathology, its incidence, mechanism, relevance, diagnosis, and prognosis remain to be investigated. Our index case, a 64-year-old man with decompensated alcohol-related cirrhosis, underwent a cadaveric orthotopic liver transplant and was having a normal postoperative course. On postoperative day 12, liver enzymes were elevated, and Doppler ultrasound performed showed hepatic arterial occlusion. In view of hepatic artery thrombosis digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was done, which showed a string bead appearance of graft hepatic artery, with no thrombosis or stenosis of hepatic artery anastomosis. It was managed by oral administration of vasodilator, as well as intra-arterial administration of vasodilators through DSA catheter tip placed in the hepatic artery. He responded well to the management and was discharged on postoperative day 24 with normal liver enzymes.
