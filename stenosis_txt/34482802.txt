Title: Coordination of PRKCA/PRKCA-AS1 interplay facilitates DNA methyltransferase 1 recruitment on DNA methylation to affect protein kinase C alpha transcription in mitral valve of rheumatic heart disease.

Abstract: In the present study, mitral valve tissues from three mitral stenosis patients with RHD by valve replacement and two healthy donors were harvested and conducted DNA methylation signature on PRKCA by MeDIP-qPCR. The presence of hypomethylated CpG islands at promoter and 5' terminal of PRKCA was observed in RHD accompanied with highly expressed PRKCA and down-regulated antisense long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) PRKCA-AS1 compared to health control. Furthermore, the enrichments of DNMT1/3A/3B on PRKCA were detected by ChIP-qPCR assay in vivo and in human cardiomyocyte AC16 and RL-14 cells exposed to TNF-Î± in vitro, and both demonstrated that DNMT1 substantially contributed to DNA methylation. Additionally, PRKCA-AS1 was further determined to bind with promoter of PRKCA via 5' terminal and interact with DNMT1 via 3' terminal. Taken together, our results illuminated a novel regulatory mechanism of DNA methylation on regulating PRKCA transcription through lncRNA PRKCA-AS1, and shed light on the molecular pathogenesis of RHD occurrence.
