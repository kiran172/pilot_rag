Title: Dorsal oral mucosa graft in combination with ventral penile flap as an alternative to repair obliterative stenosis of the anterior urethra in a single surgical time.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Obliterative urethral stenosis is a type of urethral lesion that compromises the whole corpus spongiosum's circumference. We present our experience in resolving complex long segment urethral obliteration in a single procedure using a combination of dorsal onlay oral mucosa graft (OMG) and ventral fasciocutaneous penile skin flap.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospectively maintained database was reviewed, which included data of men presenting long, obliterative strictures. Patients were excluded if they were lost to follow-up before one year. Failure was defined as need for further urethral instrumentation. The surgical technique used consisted on the fixation of OMG to the tunica albuginea of the corpus cavernosum, thus creating a new urethral plate. Penile or foreskin flaps were employed to complete the ventral aspect. Postoperative follow-up was done with a voiding cystourethrography at week 3.
RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were included with a median age of 49 years. Mean follow-up was 25 months. Failure was found for 3 patients (2 of them needing dilations and only one required a new urethral reconstruction).
CONCLUSION: Single stage combination of dorsal OMG with ventral fasciocutaneous penile flap showed good results for selected patients affected with obliterative urethral stenosis.
