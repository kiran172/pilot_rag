Title: Rectal Eversion as an Anus-sparing Technique in Laparoscopic Low Anterior Resection With Double Stapling Anastomosis: Long-term Functional Results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rectal eversion (RE) is a natural orifice specimen extraction (NOSE) method that allows anus-sparing resection in very low rectal tumors. This study aims to share the long-term results of RE in laparoscopic rectal resection performed with double stapling anastomosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective cohort study was conducted for patients who underwent laparoscopic low anterior resection with RE. Age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, type of surgery, distance of the tumor to the dentate line, specimen extraction site, cancer stage, preoperative chemoradiotherapy, postoperative complications, and postoperative clinical follow-up findings were recorded. Incontinence was assessed using the Wexner score (WS). Low anterior resection syndrome (LARS) is determined by the LARS score. A 7-point Likert scale was used to evaluate the satisfaction of the patients.
RESULTS: A total of 17 patients underwent resection by RE for rectal tumors. Of the 11 patients included in the study, 4 were female and 7 were male. The mean age was 66.09±15.04 years. The mean follow-up was 64.18±16.83 months. The mean tumor diameter was 3.1 cm (range: 0.9 to 7.2 cm). The mean distance of the tumor from the dentate line was 2.7 cm (range: 1.2 to 5.6 cm). No anastomotic leak was observed in any patient. One patient had an anastomotic stenosis and was treated with balloon dilatation. The median LARS score was 16 (range 0 to 32) and 64% of the patients had no LARS. Two patients had minor LARS and 2 patients had major LARS. The median Wexner score was 3.5 (range 0 to 14). The median Likert scale was 7 (range 5 to 7). It was found that 55% of the patients were extremely satisfied, 18% were satisfied, and 27% were slightly satisfied with their surgery. There were no dissatisfied patients.
CONCLUSION: RE is a safe NOSE technique in laparoscopic double stapling anastomosis for rectal resection. There is a high level of long-term patient satisfaction with anus-sparing procedures via RE, even in the presence of various symptoms.
