Title: Neuropathic Pain Component in Patients with Cervical Radicular Pain: A Single-Center Retrospective Study.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Evidence regarding the prevalence of neuropathic pain in patients with cervical radicular pain is limited. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence of neuropathic pain components in patients with cervical radicular pain using established screening tools and identify the relationship between neuropathic pain components and clinical factors. Materials and Methods: Data from 103 patients (aged ≥ 20 years) with cervical radicular pain who visited our pain clinic were analyzed retrospectively. Demographic characteristics, history of neck surgery, pain intensity using numeric rating score, dominant pain site, duration of symptoms, and neck disability index were assessed. The prevalence of neuropathic pain components was defined according to the Douleur Neuropathique 4 questions and painDETECT questionnaire tools. Patient characteristics were compared using the chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables and the independent t-test or Mann−Whitney U test for continuous variables. The correlation between neck disability index and other variables was analyzed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: Of the 103 patients, 29 (28.1%) had neuropathic pain components. The neck disability index was significantly higher (p < 0.001) for patients in the neuropathic pain group (23.79 ± 6.35) than that in the non- neuropathic pain group (18.43 ± 7.68). The Douleur Neuropathique 4 questions (r = 0.221, p < 0.025) and painDETECT questionnaire (r = 0.368, p < 0.001) scores positively correlated with the neck disability index score. Conclusions: The prevalence of neuropathic pain components in patients with cervical radicular pain was low. The patients in our study showed a strong correlation between functional deterioration and their neuropathic pain screening score. This study may be useful in understanding the characteristics of cervical radicular pain.
