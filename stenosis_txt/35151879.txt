Title: Acute shear stress and vein graft disease.

Abstract: The long saphenous vein is commonly used in cardiac surgery to bypass occluded coronary arteries. Its use is complicated by late stenosis and occlusion due to the development of intimal hyperplasia. It is accepted that intimal hyperplasia is a multifactorial inflammatory process that starts immediately after surgery. The role of acute changes in haemodynamic conditions when the vein is implanted into arterial circulation, especially shear stress, is not fully appreciated. This review provides an overview of intimal hyperplasia and the effect of acute shear stress changes on the activation of pro-inflammatory mediators.
