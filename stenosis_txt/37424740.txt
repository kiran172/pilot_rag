Title: Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA), medical treatment of severe systemic compromise: case report.

Abstract: CASE DESCRIPTION: A 42-year-old woman with severe pulmonary and mediastinal inflammatory involvement, secondary to infiltration of a silicone-related allogenic material with systemic migration.
CLINICAL FINDINGS: The patient developed esophageal and bronchial stenosis, recurrent infections, malnutrition, and respiratory deterioration, making surgical removal of the allogenic material impossible.
TREATMENT AND OUTCOME: Clinical and radiological improvement was achieved after treatment with multiple intravenous and oral immunomodulators.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) is a heterogeneous disease resulting from exposure to allogenic substances in a susceptible subject. These substances cause autoimmune or autoinflammatory phenomena. Since ASIA was described ten years ago, its diagnostic criteria are still under discussion, with an uncertain prognosis. The ideal therapy is based on eliminating the causative substance, but this is not always possible. Therefore, it is necessary to start an immunomodulatory treatment, using it in this patient, a scheme that had not been previously reported in the literature.
