Title: Access-site complications of transradial percutaneous coronary intervention using sheathless guiding catheters for acute coronary syndrome: a prospective cohort study with radial ultrasound follow-up.

Abstract: The advantages of sheathless guiding catheters over the conventional approach using sheaths in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) regarding access-site complications, particularly ultrasound-diagnosed radial artery occlusion (RAO), remain unknown. The present study investigated the incidence of access-site complications of transradial primary PCI using sheathless guiding catheters in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This prospective study evaluated access-site complications in 500 patients with ACS undergoing sheathless transradial primary PCI. Doppler ultrasound evaluation of the radial arteries was performed 2 and 30 days after the procedure. Sheathless guiding catheters (7.5-Fr) were used in 91.0% of the patients. The procedural success rate was 98.4%. Ultrasound-diagnosed RAO rates were 2.0% and 3.8% at 2- and 30-day follow-ups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis identified that the sheath-to-artery ratio (per 0.1) (odds ratio [OR] 5.71; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.18-27.71; p = 0.001) was associated with more frequent RAO and that hypertension (OR 0.22; 95% CI 0.06-0.81; p = 0.023) was associated with less frequent RAO. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that a sheath-to-artery ratio of 1.47 was the cutoff for 30-day post-procedural RAO (sensitivity 72%, specificity 81%). Sheathless transradial primary PCI for ACS was associated with a low incidence of access-site complications and a higher sheath-to-artery ratio cutoff for RAO than that expected from conventional PCI using sheaths based on historical data, demonstrating the access-site safety of sheathless guiding catheters and their benefit in PCI for ACS (University Hospital Medical Information Network-Clinical Trial Registry Number UMIN000019931).
