Title: Progress in the treatment and prevention of esophageal stenosis after endoscopic submucosal dissection.

Abstract: The primary treatment for early esophageal cancer and precancerous lesions is endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). However, this approach leads to a high incidence of postoperative esophageal stenosis, which can significantly impact a patient's quality of life. While various methods are available to prevent post-ESD esophageal stenosis, their effectiveness varies. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of the currently employed methods for preventing post-ESD esophageal stenosis in clinical practice in view of assisting clinical practitioners.
