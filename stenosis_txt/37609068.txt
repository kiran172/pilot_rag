Title: Coronary artery involvement in a patient with IgG4-related disease.

Abstract: Immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a chronic fibro-inflammatory disorder of obscure etiology characterized by significant infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells toward several organs. Coronary artery involvement is rarely seen in IgG4-RD patients; thereby, we aim to outline the noninvasive imaging findings of this rare case. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) from a 15-year-old female diagnosed with IgG4-RD via histopathological assessment of orbital biopsy, were analyzed. CMR showed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and akinesia of the basal to mid-lateral, anterior, and septal walls. Inflammation of the basal to apical lateral wall and subendocardial infarction of the basal to apical lateral and mid inferoseptal walls were also evident. CCTA findings showed stenosis in branches of the left main artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and right coronary artery (RCA), aortitis, and aortic wall thickening. After courses of proper treatment with prednisolone, Cellcept, and adalimumab, follow-up CMR showed significant improvement in LV systolic function and resolution of inflammation. Although IgG4-RD is an uncommon cause of coronary artery disease, it can cause lethal complications such as myocardial infarction. Hence, clinicians should be aware of cardiac complications in these patients.
