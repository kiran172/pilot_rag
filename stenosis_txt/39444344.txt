Title: Is Outpatient Supraglottoplasty Possible? Examination of Perioperative Comorbidities and Outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Supraglottoplasty (SGP) is necessary in approximately 10% to 15% of infants with congenital laryngomalacia (LM). Postoperative management strategies vary and this study examines outcomes and readmission rates.
STUDY DESIGN: This is a retrospective chart review.
SETTING: A single tertiary care institution's patients undergoing SGP from 2012 to May 2022.
METHODS: Patients were assigned to 1 of 3 groups based on length of stay (LOS) including 0, 1, or 2+ days. Preoperative data included age, prevailing symptoms, and comorbidities at the time of surgery. Postoperative data included level of care, perioperative complications, readmission rates, and SGP failure. Descriptive statistics were used to evaluate differences between the 3 groups.
RESULTS: Following SGP in 975 patients, 23.8% were discharged the same day (Group 0), 63.2% were observed overnight (Group 1), and 13.0% required 2+ days (Group 2). Four of the 616 patients in Group 1 were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, and 11 patients in Group 2. The patients in Group 2 had a higher incidence of Pepcid use, previous intubation, cardiac anomalies, prior gastrostomy tube (G tube), subglottic stenosis, cyanosis, failure to thrive, and prematurity. The significant differences in the group admitted to the ICU were those admitted for airway, cerebral palsy, prior G tube, PSG, prior intubation, or cardiac anomaly (P = <.05). Readmission rates from Group 0 versus 1 were 1.3% and 2.9%, respectively, though this was not statistically significant.
CONCLUSION: SGP is a safe procedure that can be performed in the outpatient setting in select patients.
