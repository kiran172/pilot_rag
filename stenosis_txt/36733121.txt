Title: [A Case of Laparoscopic Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer Occurring after Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Using the Right Gastroepiploic Artery].

Abstract: We present a case of 72-year-old man who was diagnosed with gastric cancer that occurred after coronary artery bypass grafting(CABG)with the right gastroepiploic artery(RGEA). Gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a 0-Ⅱc lesion at the posterior wall of gastric angle, and diagnosis was cStage Ⅰ(T2N0M0). Cardiac computed-tomography showed an occlusion of the RGEA graft, suggesting that the RGEA graft could be ligated and dissected. Coronary angiography showed no severe stenosis of the right coronary artery, suggesting that coronary revascularization was not necessary. He underwent laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection. During the operation, the RGEA graft was dissected after clamp test for 20 minutes to confirm no cardiac event. In such cases, it is crucial to consider whether it is possible or not to dissect the RGEA graft and whether to restore the coronary flow with preoperative meticulous examination.
