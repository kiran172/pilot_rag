Title: Co-culture of human fibroblasts, smooth muscle and endothelial cells promotes osteopontin induction in hypoxia.

Abstract: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are the preferred vascular access for haemodialysis of patients suffering from end-stage renal disease, a worldwide public health problem. However, they are prone to a high rate of failure due to neointimal hyperplasia and stenosis. This study aimed to determine if osteopontin (OPN) was induced in hypoxia and if OPN could be responsible for driving AVF failure. Identification of new factors that participate in remodelling of AVFs is a challenge. Three cell lines representing the cells of the three layers of the walls of arteries and veins, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, were tested in mono- and co-culture in vitro for OPN expression and secretion in normoxia compared to hypoxia after silencing the hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF-1α, HIF-2α and HIF-1/2α) with siRNA or after treatment with an inhibitor of NF-kB. None of the cells in mono-culture showed OPN induction in hypoxia, whereas cells in co-culture secreted OPN in hypoxia. The changes in oxygenation that occur during AVF maturation up-regulate secretion of OPN through cell-cell interactions between the different cell layers that form AVF, and in turn, these promote endothelial cell proliferation and could participate in neointimal hyperplasia.
