Title: Management of an Iatrogenic Pulmonary Artery Rupture via Balloon Tamponade.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery rupture is a rare complication of right heart catheterization characterized by a rapid clinical deterioration and high mortality rate. We present the case of an 89-year-old woman with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent cardiac catheterization prior to aortic valve replacement. The patient had acute cardiopulmonary deterioration due to pulmonary artery rupture at the time of right heart catheterization, that was successfully sealed by balloon tamponade.
