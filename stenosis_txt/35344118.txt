Title: Impact of the first era of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on gastric cancer patients: a single-institutional analysis in Japan.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little is known about the disadvantages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic in patients with gastric cancer. This study aimed to examine the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with gastric cancer in the first era in Japan.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 725 patients diagnosed with gastric cancer who visited our hospital between April 2019 and March 2021. The number of patients and their characteristics before and during the COVID-19 pandemic were compared.
RESULTS: The number of patients diagnosed with gastric cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic decreased by 26.2% (from 417 to 308; p = 0.013) compared to that before the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a significant decrease in cStage I cancer and an increase in cStage III cancer (p = 0.004). Patients were often symptomatic (p = 0.029), especially those with stenosis-related symptoms (p < 0.001) and longer symptom duration (p < 0.001). The number of endoscopic resections was decreased by 34.8% (p = 0.005). The number of total gastrectomy was higher than that of partial gastrectomy (p = 0.021). The median time to treatment was significantly shorter (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In Japan, delays diagnosing patients with gastric cancer, probably due to refraining from consultation, may have resulted in an increase in the diagnosis of advanced-stage cancer. Moreover, an increasing proportion of patients required more invasive gastrectomy. Therefore, it may be necessary to educate patients not to refrain from consultation, even during the COVID-19 pandemic, as it can have a negative impact on treatment, policy decision, and prognosis of gastric cancer.
