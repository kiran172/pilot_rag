Title: Correlation of N-terminal-pro-brain natriuretic peptide with postoperative outcomes of older patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement surgery (TAVR) are typically older adults with multiple chronic diseases and therefore have a high surgical risk. The N-terminal of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pro-BNP, referred to as NT-pro-BNP, is an easily measurable biomarker of heart failure. Studies on correlation between higher NT-pro-BNP levels and adverse prognoses after TAVR have yielded inconsistent results. Here, we investigated whether preoperative NT-pro-BNP levels are correlated with outcomes among older adults undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: This retrospective study included older adults with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who received TAVR from a medical center between January 2013 and June 2017. The patients' demographics, preoperative laboratory data, postoperative complications, and 1-year mortality were recorded. They were divided into two groups based on their preoperative NT-pro-BNP levels. The post-TAVR outcomes in the two groups were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression analysis of the binary results.
RESULTS: Of the 132 patients included (mean age: 81.5 ± 8.1 years; 47% men), 96 (72.7%) had preoperative NT-pro-BNP levels ≤ 4853 ng/L, and 36 (27.3%) had preoperative NT-pro-BNP levels > 4853 ng/L. The postoperative outcomes were significantly better in the NT-pro-BNP≤4853 group than in the NT-pro-BNP>4853 group: postoperative extracorporeal membrane oxygenation fittings (4.2% vs 16.7%, p = 0.025), number of days in hospital (17.5 ± 21.0 vs 27 ± 17.0, p = 0.009), in-hospital mortality (4.2% vs 16.7%, p = 0.025), and 1-year mortality (11.5% vs 38.9%, p = 0.001); the significant differences persisted after controlling for other variables.
CONCLUSION: For older patients undergoing TAVR with NT-pro-BNP levels > 4853 ng/L, their postoperative outcomes and 1-year mortality were correlated. Thus, NT-pro-BNP is useful for the risk assessment of patients undergoing TAVR and should be regarded as a biomarker in future risk assessments.
