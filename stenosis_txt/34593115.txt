Title: Early Leaflet Thickening, Durability and Bioprosthetic Valve Failure in TAVR.

Abstract: All bioprosthetic valves, both surgical and transcatheter, have a finite lifespan before their leaflets inevitably degenerate, leading to stenosis or regurgitation. As younger, low-risk patients receive a transcatheter aortic valve, it is expected that they will most likely outlive their bioprosthetic valve. The heterogeneity of studies regarding surgical valve durability makes the interpretation of the data challenging. Leaflet thickening is seen in transcatheter heart valves but currently there is no evidence that it leads to premature valve deterioration or clinical events. Standardized definitions of structural valve deterioration should allow for comparisons between future clinical trials to assess the durability of different transcatheter heart valves.
