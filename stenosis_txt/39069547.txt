Title: Clinical outcomes of multidrug-resistant tracheobronchial tuberculosis receiving anti-tuberculosis regimens containing bedaquiline or delamanid.

Abstract: The treatment of multidrug-resistant tracheobronchial tuberculosis poses challenges, and research investigating the efficacy of bedaquiline or delamanid as treatment for this condition is limited. This retrospective cohort study was conducted from 2017 to 2021. The study extracted data of patients with multidrug-resistant tracheobronchial tuberculosis from medical records and followed up on prognoses. Participants were divided into three groups: the bedaquiline, delamanid, and control group. Clinical outcomes and the risk factors associated with early culture conversion were analyzed. This study included 101 patients, with 32, 25, and 44 patients in the bedaquiline, delamanid, and control groups respectively. The differences in the treatment success rates among the three groups did not show statistical significance. Both the bedaquiline and delamanid groups had significantly higher culture conversion rates compared to the control after 2 or 6 months of treatment, with significantly shorter median times to culture conversion (bedaquiline group: 2 weeks, delamanid group: 2 weeks, control group: 12 weeks, P < 0.001). Treatment with bedaquiline or delamanid were identified as independent predictors of culture conversion at 2 months (bedaquiline group: aOR = 13.417, 95% CI 4.067-44.260, delamanid group: aOR = 9.333, 95% CI 2.498-34.878) or 6 months (bedaquiline group: aOR = 13.333, 95% CI 3.379-52.610, delamanid group: aOR = 5.000, 95% CI 1.357-18.426) of treatment through multivariable logistic regression analyses. The delamanid group showed better improvement in lumen stenosis compared to bedaquiline. Regimens containing bedaquiline or delamanid may accelerate the culture conversion during the early treatment phase in multidrug-resistant tracheobronchial tuberculosis, and delamanid appears to have the potential to effectively improve airway stenosis.
