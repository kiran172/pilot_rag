Title: Neurologic Clinical Manifestations of Fahr Syndrome and Hypoparathyroidism.

Abstract: A 41-year-old female with a history of chronic hypoparathyroidism with Fahr syndrome presented with complaints of weakness and muscle spasticity. Brain imaging demonstrated diffuse intracranial calcifications. In addition, cervical spine imaging revealed extensive calcification along the anterior and posterior cervical vertebral bodies causing multilevel stenosis and cord compression. The patient underwent a multilevel posterior cervical decompression and fusion. Postoperatively, the patient had noted improvement in her upper and lower extremity strength and spasticity. This illustrative case demonstrates rare clinical and radiographic neurologic sequelae of long-standing hypoparathyroidism.
