Title: New Onset Atrial Fibrillation Following Transcatheter and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: New-onset atrial fibrillation (NOAF) is a well-recognised, although variably reported complication following surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Rates of NOAF following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) seem to be notably less than SAVR, even though this population is typically older and of higher risk. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of NOAF in both these populations and associated postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting rates of NOAF post SAVR or TAVI, along with early postoperative outcomes. Twenty-five (25) studies with a total of 13,010 patients were included in the final analysis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of NOAF post SAVR was 0.4 (95% CI 0.36-0.44) and post TAVI 0.15 (95% CI 0.11-0.18). NOAF was associated with an increased risk of postoperative cerebrovascular accident (CVA) for SAVR and TAVI (RR 1.44 95% CI 1.01-2.06 and RR 2.24 95% CI 1.46-3.45 respectively). NOAF was associated with increased mortality in the TAVI group (RR 3.02 95% CI 1.55-5.9) but not the SAVR group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.54-1.84). Hospital length of stay was increased for both TAVI and SAVR patients with NOAF (MD 2.54 days, 95% CI 2.0-3.00) and (MD 1.64 days, 95% CI 0.04-3.24 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of NOAF is significantly less following TAVI, as compared to SAVR. While NOAF is associated with increased risk of postoperative stroke for both groups, for TAVI alone NOAF confers increased risk of early mortality.
