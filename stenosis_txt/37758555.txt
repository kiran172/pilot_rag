Title: A technique for fabricating a hollowed nasal stent using a connector of an intravenous infusion set to manage iatrogenic nasal vestibular stenosis in an infant.

Abstract: The presented technique describes the steps for fabricating a hollow and rigid intranasal stent to maintain the patency of the nasal passage after iatrogenic nasal vestibular stenosis in an infant. The technique uses a connector between the injection bulb or site and the hypodermic needle of an intravenous infusion set to ease the impression making and avoid the additional step of hollowing the stent.
