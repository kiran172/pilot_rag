Title: Pancreatic head resections in the setting of celiac axis stenosis: Case report and review of literature.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ischemic complications are a notable cause of morbidity in patients after pancreatic head resections. Stenosis of celiac axis in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy requires further perioperative attention.
CASE REPORT: We present a patient with pancreatic head malignancy scheduled for Whipple procedure in the setting of hemodynamically significant celiac axis stenosis. Despite release of the artery from compression by median arcuate ligament, elevation of liver function tests on the first postoperative day was noted. Endovascular stenting was performed on the same day with significant radiological improvement and subsequent normalization of laboratory values. The patient had no further postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: Fast recognition of ischemic complications after pancreatic head resection is crucial. Even postoperatively, endovascular intervention might be a feasible treatment modality of celiac axis stenosis in selected patients who undergo pancreatoduodenectomy.
