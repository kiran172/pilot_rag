Title: Laparoscopic Collis-Nissen approach for shortened esophagus treatment in children.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Short esophagus is a disability to obtain a proper portion of abdominal esophagus, thus a lengthening technique is required. Collis approach is the best option.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate effectiveness of laparoscopic Collis-Nissen approach in children.
METHOD: Retrospective and descriptive case series performed in children with reflux and short esophagus, Collis esophagoplasty was carried out with stapler, together with fundoplication. Age, symptomatology, surgical background, oral nutrition beginning, hospital stay, complications and reflux control were recorded.
RESULTS: Eight children, 4-15 years old were treated from 2005 to 2017. Three of them with slipped fundoplication background and two with esophageal atresia. The rest of the children had no background, two of them with stenosis. Symptoms; cough 8/8, abdominal pain 5/8, dysphagia 3/8. Without complications. Oral nutrition beginning at the 5th day. Up to 10 years follow-up, with complete remission of the symptomatology in 6 years.
DISCUSSION: Since a true short esophagus diagnosis depends on transurgical findings, pediatric surgeons should notice this entity when practicing any antireflux procedure. Laparoscopic Collis-Nissen approach is safe and efficient in these patients.
