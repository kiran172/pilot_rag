Title: Congenital Nasal Pyriform Aperture Stenosis.

Abstract: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is a rare cause of neonatal stridor and airway obstruction. In this case report we present management of congenital CNPAS in an eight day old female child. Inability to pass nasogastric tube (of size 5Fr) raised suspicion of choanal atresia or pyriform aperture (PA) stenosis (PAS). Computed tomography scan of the paranasal sinuses is the investigation of choice. Transnasal endoscopic dilatation and stenting with ngt of 8Fr under general anaesthesia was done. In this case report we discuss the aetiology, presenting symptoms, diagnostic methods and treatment modalities for CNPAS.
