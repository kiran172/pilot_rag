Title: Ponytail Left Anterior Descending Artery: A Case Report.

Abstract: Division of the anterior descending branch into many small arteries is a rare coronary anomaly. We report the case of a 64-year-old female with severe stenosis (>75%) in the proximal region of the anterior descending branch as indicated by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). In addition, coronary angiography showed that the anterior descending branch of the coronary artery split into numerous small arteries, an anomaly that can confound clinical examination.
