Title: Association of Valve Size and Hemodynamic Performance With Clinical Outcomes in Aortic Valve Replacement　- A Long-Term Follow-up in an Asian Population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies of the influence of smaller body type on the severity of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after small-sized surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) are few, but the issue is particularly relevant for Asian patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: 695 patients who underwent SAVR with bioprosthetic valves had their hemodynamic valve performance analyzed at 3 months, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after operation, and clinical outcomes were assessed. The patients were stratified into 3 valve size groups: 19/21, 23, and 25/27 mm. A smaller valve was associated with higher mean pressure gradients at the 4 time points after operation (P trend <0.05). However, the 3 valve size groups demonstrated no significant differences in the risk of clinical events. At none of the time points did patients with projected PPM show increased mean pressure gradients (P>0.05), whereas patients with measured PPM did (P<0.05). Compared with patients with projected PPM, those with measured PPM demonstrated higher rates of infective endocarditis readmission (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.31, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06-10.39) and a higher risk of composite outcomes (aHR 1.45, 95% CI 0.95-2.22, P=0.087).
CONCLUSIONS: Relative to those receiving larger valves, patients receiving small bioprosthetic valves had poorer hemodynamic performance but did not demonstrate differences in clinical events in long-term follow-up.
