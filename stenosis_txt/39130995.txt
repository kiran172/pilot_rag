Title: Acute Radial Artery Thromboembolic Occlusion During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Case Report and Review of Management Strategies.

Abstract: Acute limb ischemia requires prompt diagnosis and treatment. Thromboembolic events are common, especially in patients with multiple risk factors. This case report describes a rare complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) involving thromboembolic occlusion of the radial artery and highlights the risk of embolic complications during TAVR. While TAVR is minimally invasive and preferred for high-risk patients, it carries the risk of complications such as paravalvular leakage and cerebrovascular events. Prompt recognition and management are crucial. Various mechanisms, including catheter manipulation and altered hemodynamics, contribute to embolic risks during TAVR. Awareness and management of rare embolic complications during TAVR are essential. Further research is needed to prevent these complications and improve patient outcomes.
