Title: [Stenotic FAV: Success of the Collaboration Between Spoke and HUB].

Abstract: The arteriovenous fistula constitutes the vascular access of first choice in hemodialysis. We present three clinical cases that highlight the resolution in interventional radiology of venous stenosis, one of the major complications. Clinical monitoring and instrumental diagnostics with color Doppler ultrasound have prevented the failure of the AVF due to high risk of thrombosis. The angiographic interventions, thanks to the collaboration between Spoke and Hub, were completed without complications.
