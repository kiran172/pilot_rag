Title: Muscle Strength Decline Caused by Eperisone Hydrochloride: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 65-year-old female with thoracic spinal stenosis and incomplete paraplegia underwent T11-T12 posterior thoracic interbody fusion. During postoperative rehabilitation, she experienced thigh pain, involuntary lower limb convulsions, and muscle fatigue. Despite being prescribed eperisone hydrochloride for relief, her muscle strength decreased after 14 doses. This adverse effect, not listed in the latest Chinese medication instructions, subsided 4 days after discontinuation. This case suggests eperisone hydrochloride potentially caused reversible muscle strength decline, highlighting its potential unsuitability for incomplete paraplegia patients due to possible further muscle strength reduction. We propose updating the medication instructions to alert clinicians to this risk.
