Title: Paraoxonase 2 C311S single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with type C lesions in coronary atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Paraoxonases (PON) 1-3 are lactonases with antioxidant and atheroprotective properties. The best known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the PON family, include: Q192R (rs662), L55M (rs854560) in the PON1 gene and C311S (rs7493) in the PON2 gene. Their influence on the occurrence and course of coronary artery disease (CAD) is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess the association between the most common PON1 and PON2 genetic variants with the presence of CAD, as well as their relation to coronary lesion complexity in accordance with the ACC/AHA standard.
METHODS: We included 1027 individuals: 367 CAD patients qualified for coronary angiography and 660 healthy volunteers as controls. We extracted DNA from circulating blood leukocytes, amplified the PON1 and PON2 genetic sequence and used restriction enzymes to identify the SNPs. Patients with CAD underwent coronary angiography and were assigned to two groups based on lesion severity: patients with at least one type C lesion and without a type C lesion. The former where categorized into those with a significant narrowing (â‰¥50% diameter stenosis) and those without one.
RESULTS: We found no association between the analyzed SNPs and symptomatic CAD. However, in patients with diagnosed CAD, the PON311S allele was independently associated with the risk of the most complex type C coronary lesion occurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first report of an association between PON2 311S SNP and the type of coronary atherosclerotic lesions in humans.
