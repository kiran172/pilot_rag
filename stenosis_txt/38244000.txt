Title: Transcatheter Paravalvular Leak Closure With Covered Stent Tract and Vascular Plug: Tootsie Roll Technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter closure of transcatheter heart valve (THV)-related paravalvular leak (PVL) is associated with a high failure rate with available devices due to the complex interaction of THV and aortic/mitral annulus.
OBJECTIVES: This study reports on novel transcatheter techniques to treat PVL after THV.
METHODS: The authors describe consecutive patients who underwent PVL closure after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR). A covered self-expanding stent (Viabahn) was deployed in the defect to create a seal between the THV and annulus. A vascular plug (Amplatzer Vascular Plug 2 [AVP2] or AVP4) was then deployed inside the covered stent to obliterate PVL.
RESULTS: Eight patients with THV-related PVL were treated using this method (aortic [3 SAPIEN, 1 Evolut], mitral [2 SAPIEN-in-MAC (mitral annular calcification), 2 M3 TMVR). Various combinations of stents and plugs were used (5 mm × 2.5 cm Viabahn + 6 mm AVP4 [n = 2], 8 mm × 2.5 cm Viabahn + 10 mm AVP2 [n = 5], and 10 mm × 5.0 cm Viabahn + 12 mm AVP2 [n = 1]). All had technical success with immediate elimination of target PVL, without in-hospital complications. None had signs of postprocedure hemolysis. All patients were discharged alive (median 3.5 days [Q1-Q3: 1.0-4.8 days]). No residual PVL was seen at discharge, except for 1 patient with mild regurgitation due to another untreated PVL location. One patient died before 30 days due to complication of valve-in-MAC TMVR. In remaining patients, none had recurrence of PVL at 30 days. Symptoms decreased to NYHA functional class I/II in 6 patients. NYHA functional class III symptoms remained in 1 patient with mitral regurgitation awaiting subsequent valve replacement procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The technique of sequential deployment of a covered stent and vascular plug may effectively treat THV-related PVL.
