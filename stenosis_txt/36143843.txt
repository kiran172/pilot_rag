Title: Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Intravascular-Ultrasound-Guided Intervention in Minimal Coronary Artery Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopy intravascular ultrasounds (NIRS-IVUSs) can identify high-risk plaque morphologies associated with future event risk. However, the usage of NIRS-IVUSs is not universal. We report a case with insignificant coronary angiography (CAG) and high-risk NIRS-IVUS findings. A 58-year-old man with exertional dyspnea was admitted for a CAG evaluation. The CAG of the patient demonstrated mild angiographic stenosis in the mid-left anterior descending artery. However, NIRS-IVUS revealed a high maximum lipid core burden index at 4 mm (MaxLCBI4mm) and an intraluminal calcific protrusion with severe luminal stenosis at the lesion. Therefore, the patient was diagnosed as stable angina, and a drug-eluting stent was implanted in the lesion. A post-stent NIRS-IVUS demonstrated improved MaxLCBI4mm and significantly improved luminal stenosis. The patient did not have any procedural complications. In the present case, a patient with insignificant CAG demonstrated multiple high-risk features on NIRS-IVUS. Therefore, a percutaneous coronary intervention was performed. The presented case highlights the utility of NIRS-IVUS in nonobstructive CAG.
