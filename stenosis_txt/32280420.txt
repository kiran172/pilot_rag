Title: Williams-Beuren Syndrome: The Role of Cardiac CT in Diagnosis.

Abstract: Williams-Beuren syndrome is a multisystem genetic disorder associated with cardiovascular abnormalities, the most common of which is some variation of arterial stenosis. We describe a case of Williams-Beuren syndrome with multiple cardiovascular structural and arterial abnormalities and demonstrate the unique role of cardiac computed tomography in diagnosis.
