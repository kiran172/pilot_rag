Title: Acroangiodermatitis of the hand secondary to a dysfunctional arteriovenous fistula.

Abstract: Acroangiodermatitis (AAD) is often seen in association with various vascular anomalies such as venous insufficiency, vascular syndromes, and conditions associated with thrombosis. This is the first case reported in the literature associated with arteriovenous fistula stenosis in a patient with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. This case is being described for its rarity and to familiarize the clinicians with this unusual complication, especially, to prevent them from thinking of this condition as an infectious complication. It is essential to recognize the uniqueness of the pathophysiology of this disease and to do a clear distinction with that of a venous ulcer. With this work we also aim to help health practitioners with proper management of the condition. As we've seen, surgical treatment in appropriately selected cases corrects the reflux of the venous system and successfully improves the appearance of the verrucous lesion. Our patient was successfully treated by correcting the arteriovenous fistula stenosis with near-complete subsidence of the verrucous lesion within days of the procedure. Acroangiodermatitis management must be conducted with a multidisciplinary approach (dermatology, vascular surgery, and internal medicine). It is essential the comprehensive management of these patients, to ensure prompt recovery and avoid chronic effects, as well as to guarantee the quality of life in the future.
