Title: Right ventricular deformation and right ventricular-arterial coupling in patients with heart failure due to severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI: long-term results.

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the long-term prognostic significance of right ventricular (RV) deformation and RV-arterial coupling in a cohort of patients with heart failure (HF) due to severe aortic stenosis (AS) candidate for trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: The study is a retrospective analysis of 56 patients undergoing echocardiography before TAVI execution. RV function was defined by tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), fractional area change (FAC), peak systolic myocardial velocity by tissue Doppler imaging (RVSm) and RV longitudinal strain (RVLS). RV-arterial coupling were defined as TAPSE and RVLS normalized for systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) to obtain afterload-independent parameters: TAPSE/sPAP and RVLS/sPAP, respectively. All-cause mortality was the primary endpoint of survival analysis; composite of death and hospitalization for HF was the secondary endpoint.
RESULTS: All patients underwent TAVI from femoral access. Mean age was 81.6±6.3 years and left ventricular ejection fraction was preserved in most patients (51±15%). At 10 years, using Cox regression analysis adjusted for the parameters related to prognosis at univariate analysis, we found that only pre-procedural RVLS was independently associated with all-cause mortality (aHR 1.53, 95% CI 1.10-2.12, P=0.011). RVLS (aHR 7.542, 95% CI 1.325-42.921, P=0.023), sPAP (aHR 1.421, 95% CI 1.045-1.932, P=0.025), TAPSE/sPAP (aHR 4.977, 95% CI 5.425-21.99, P=0.044) and RVLS/sPAP (aHR 2.333, 95% CI 3.9677-12.999, P=0.046) were independently associated with the secondary endpoint.
CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with HF due to severe AS undergoing TAVI, deformation imaging (i.e., RVLS) and RV-arterial coupling (i.e., TAPSE/sPAP and RVLS/sPAP) provide better risk stratification at long-term follow up of 10 years than other RV echocardiographic parameters.
