Title: Joint Effects of Dietary Patterns and Paraoxonase1 rs662 Polymorphism on Coronary Artery Disease Severity (Gensini and SYNTAX Scores) and Its Risk Factors in adults Undergoing Angiography.

Abstract: SCOPE: The present study aims to assess the interaction of dietary patterns (DPs) and paraoxonase1 (PON1) rs662 polymorphism on coronary artery disease (CAD) severity and its risk factors.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This cross-sectional study is conducted on 425 patients undergoing angiography. The PON1 genotypes are detected by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP-PCR) technique. DPs are extracted by exploratory factor analysis. Two dietary patterns Western (WDP) and Traditional (TDP) are extracted. A gene-diet interaction concerning a high Gensini score is observed. Accordingly, high adherence to the WDP increases the odds of a high Gensini score in R allele carriers compared to QQ genotype carriers by 2.48 times (odds ratio [OR]: 2.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.98-6.26, p = 0.05). Also, the risk of high systolic blood pressure (SBP) is higher in R allele carriers with high adherence to the WDP compared to QQ genotype carriers (OR: 3.49, 95% CI 1.38-8.82, p < 0.001. No significant interaction is observed between TDP and PON1 rs662 on any cardiometabolic risk factors (p-value > 0.05). The results remain significant after adjusting for confounders.
CONCLUSION: The present study's findings indicate the existence of an interaction between the PON1 rs662 polymorphism and the WDP on the risk of stenosis severity and high SBP.
