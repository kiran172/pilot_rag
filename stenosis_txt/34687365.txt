Title: Impact of calcific aortic valve disease on valve mechanics.

Abstract: The aortic valve is a highly dynamic structure characterized by a transvalvular flow that is unsteady, pulsatile, and characterized by episodes of forward and reverse flow patterns. Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) resulting in compromised valve function and increased pressure overload on the ventricle potentially leading to heart failure if untreated, is the most predominant valve disease. CAVD is a multi-factorial disease involving molecular, tissue and mechanical interactions. In this review, we aim at recapitulating the biomechanical loads on the aortic valve, summarizing the current and most recent research in the field in vitro, in-silico, and in vivo, and offering a clinical perspective on current strategies adopted to mitigate or approach CAVD.
