Title: Prevalence of stroke-related risk factors in Albania: a single-center experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Stroke, a prominent global cause of mortality and disability, is broadly categorized into ischemic and hemorrhagic types. An epidemiological survey of stroke and its risk factors can help identify individuals at higher risk and therefore promote stroke prevention strategies. The aim of this study was to estimate the current prevalence of stroke and evaluate stroke-associated risk factors in Albania.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective analysis conducted in Albania for the period from May 2015 to September 2021. Data were collected retrospectively through hospital records. Stroke was defined as sudden onset of a nonconvulsive and focal neurological deficit, and ischemic stroke was diagnosed using brain computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, or both. We examined patient history characteristics encompassing demographics, stroke history, conventional vascular risk factors, and lifestyle-related risk factors.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 3860 patients was 74.6 Â±10.4 years, and 73.5% were men. The prevalence of carotid stenosis, arrhythmia, obesity, and hypertension was significantly higher in males than in females (p &lt; 0.001). Out of the 3860 patients in the study cohort, 641 (16.6%) subjects died, while 335 (8.7%) patients achieved complete recovery. Hemiparesis was observed in 386 (10%) patients and hemiplegia in 868 (22.4%) patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis underscores the male predominance (2.2 : 1) in stroke cases. Carotid and vertebral artery stenosis is a significant factor, emphasizing the life-saving potential of early intervention. Social and economic factors in Albania pose challenges, demanding comprehensive strategies. Prospective trials are crucial to explore intervention efficacy, and timing, and address socioeconomic impacts on timely stroke management.
