Title: Multimodality assessments of wild-type transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis with no ventricular hypertrophy.

Abstract: While patients with transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) typically present with concentric or asymmetric hypertrophy, a small percentage of ATTR-CA is known to present with 'atypical' cardiac morphologies such as eccentric hypertrophy or even no hypertrophy. However, detailed report of multimodality assessments of ATTR-CA with no ventricular hypertrophy is lacking. Herein, we report detailed multimodality assessments of an 81-year-old Japanese woman with heart failure and history of carpal tunnel syndrome and lumbar canal stenosis, presenting no ventricular hypertrophy and negative 99m technetium-pyrophosphate scintigraphy, who was eventually diagnosed as having wild-type ATTR-CA. Our case highlights the role of multimodality assessments for early diagnosis of ATTR-CA in patients with atypical cardiac morphologies and also emphasizes the limitations of bone scintigraphy and the importance of considering ATTR-CA in patients with non-cardiac manifestations of ATTR amyloidosis.
