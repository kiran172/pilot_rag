Title: Warfarin-Induced Skin Necrosis in a 14-Year-Old Female: A Case Report.

Abstract: Warfarin is a widely known oral anticoagulant used for the treatment and prevention of thromboembolicÂ conditions. A rare, crippling, and occasionally fatal complication of warfarin is skin necrosis, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Due to the disease's unknown pathophysiology and rare occurrence, the treatment guidelines are not well established. We present the case of a 14-year-old female with a history of mitral stenosis and atrial fibrillation who had been on warfarin for the last two years and now develops an acute excruciating rash within three days of reinitiation of warfarin despite enoxaparin bridging and a normal blood clotting profile. After cessation of warfarin, the skin necrosis progressed to eschar formation and resolved within four weeks. To prevent further complications, early diagnosis and treatment with intravenous vitamin K, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), and aggressive wound care are essential. The prognosis may be improved by prompt diagnosis and drug cessation.
