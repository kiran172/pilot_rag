Title: Inguinal hernia repair in an elderly patient with moderate aortic stenosis under sole epidural anesthesia: A case report.

Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: In resource limited settings, epidural anesthesia can be a safe option for elderly patients with aortic stenosis for lower abdominal surgeries as the hemodynamic changes are known to be less as compared to spinal or general anesthesia.
ABSTRACT: Spinal or general anesthesia in an elderly patient with aortic stenosis is always a challenge for anesthesiologists. It is even more challenging in a resource limited setting. The marked hemodynamic changes associated with either spinal or general anesthesia increase the morbidity and mortality. We present a case of right inguinal hernia in a 71-year-old patient with hypertension, bradycardia, and moderate aortic stenosis planned for open mesh repair under sole epidural anesthesia.
