Title: Clinical Reasoning: A 68-Year-Old Man With Palmar Rash, Leg Pain, and Inability to Walk.

Abstract: We report a 68-year-old man with palmar rash, leg pain, and inability to walk, whose neurologic examination localized to multiple roots, leading to the diagnosis of polyradiculopathy. Polyradiculopathy has both structural and nonstructural etiologies. Structural etiologies include spinal stenosis, tethered cord syndrome, tumors, and leptomeningeal metastasis. Nonstructural etiologies include inflammatory, infectious, metabolic, and other neoplastic processes. His palmar rash in conjunction with neurologic signs/symptoms raised the suspicion for an infectious etiology, and eventually, serology and lumbar puncture confirmed the final diagnosis. In this report, we will further discuss how we determined the localization of polyradiculopathy, its specific etiologies, management decisions, and a transient complication before he achieved a significant improvement at 6 months.
