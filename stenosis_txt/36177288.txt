Title: Spinal Melorheostosis Associated with Intradural Fibrous Band and Extensive Lipomatosis Causing Thoracic Cord Tethering and Myelomalacia: A Unique Case Highlighting Importance of MRI in Management.

Abstract: Axial melorheostosis is rare with only few cases reported and even fewer with symptoms. While symptoms secondary to neural foramen or spinal canal stenosis caused by hyperostotic bone are common, only three symptomatic cases of spinal melorheostosis with associated intradural lipomatous lesions have been reported to date. In none of them the fibrous component of lipofibromatous lesion was identified preoperatively on magnetic resonance imaging. We report here a case of 18-year-old male who presented with thoracic myelopathy secondary to widespread spinal melorheostosis associated with extensive intradural lipomatosis and fibrous component in thoracic lipoma, causing tethering of thoracic spinal cord and myelomalacia. The patient was treated with T2 to T9 posterior instrumented stabilization followed by T3 to T8 laminectomy along with selective thoracic lipofibromatous tumor debulking. Detection of the fibromatous component in multilevel extensive intradural lipomatosis associated with melorheostosis is helpful in planning selection of the level of surgical excision and decompression.
