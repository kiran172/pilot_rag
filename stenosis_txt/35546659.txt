Title: Clinical value and expression of Homer 1, homocysteine, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, fibroblast growth factors 23 in coronary heart disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore clinical value and expression of Homer 1, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH), homocysteine (Hcy), fibroblast growth factors (FGF) 23 in coronary heart disease (CHD).
METHODS: From March 2020 to April 2021, a total of 137 patients with CHD and 138 healthy subjects who came to our hospital for physical examination and had no cardiovascular disease were retrospectively enrolled, and they were assigned to the CHD group and the control group, respectively. Patients in the CHD group were divided into stable angina pectoris (SAP) group (n = 48), unstable angina pectoris (UAP) group (n = 46), and acute myocardial infarction (AMI) group (n = 43) according to clinical characteristics for subgroup analysis. The degree of coronary artery stenosis was assessed by Gensini score, which is a reliable assessment tool for the severity of coronary artery disease. The levels of Homer 1, SAH, Hcy, and FGF 23 were tested and compared. Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation between serum Homer1, SAH, Hcy, FGF23 levels and Gensini score, and multivariate unconditional Logistic regression was used to analyze the risk factors of coronary heart disease.
RESULTS: Demographic characteristics of each group were comparable (P > 0.05). The body mass index (BMI), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), and glucose levels of the SAP group, UAP group and AMI group were significantly higher than those of the control group, and the number of patients with smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, and diabetes history was significantly more than that of the control group, respectively (P < 0.05). The level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) of each subgroup was significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.05). The above indicators showed no significant difference among three subgroups (P > 0.05). Serum SAH, Hcy, Homer1 and FGF23 levels in each subgroup were significantly higher than those in control group (P < 0.05). And above indicators in SAP group and UAP group were significantly lower than those in AMI group (P < 0.05), and the levels of above indicators in SAP group were significantly lower than those in UAP group (P < 0.05). The results of Spearman correlation analysis showed that serum Homer1, FGF23, SAH, Hcy levels were positively correlated with Gensini score (r = 0.376, 0.623, 0.291, 0.372, all P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that smoking, hypertension, diabetes, alcohol consumption, obesity, HDL-C, FGF23, SAH, Hcy, Homer 1 were independent risk factors for coronary heart disease.
CONCLUSION: The levels of FGF23, SAH, Hcy, and Homer1 tend to increase in patients with CHD compared with normal population, and the more severe the disease, the higher the levels, which has certain reference value for the clinical diagnosis of CHD and the evaluation and monitoring of the disease.
