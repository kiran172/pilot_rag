Title: Aetiology, Diagnosis and Treatment of Arterial Occlusions of the Retina-A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Arterial occlusions of the retina are potentially sight-threatening diseases which often result in profound visual loss. The aim of this narrative review is to provide an overview of the aetiology, discuss major risk factors, describe the management and systemic assessments and evaluate existing therapies. For this review, an extensive literature search in PubMed was performed. Emboli from the heart or the carotid arteries can cause ophthalmic artery occlusion (OAO), central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) and branch retinal artery occlusion (BRAO). Most patients with arterial occlusions have vascular risk factors such as arterial hypertension, hyperhomocysteinaemia, carotid stenosis and atrial fibrillation, which also increase the risk of cerebral stroke and myocardial infarction. Therapies such as ocular massage, thrombolysis and anterior chamber paracentesis have been suggested but are still equivocal. However, it is evident that retinal artery occlusion should be immediately treated and accompanied by interdisciplinary collaboration, since early diagnosis and the proper treatment of possible risk factors are important to reduce the risk of further damage, recurrences, other vascular diseases and mortality.
