Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for patient with non-calcified bicuspid aortic valve: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-calcified aortic stenosis (AS) is rare and is associated with a high risk of transcatheter valve embolization and migration (TVEM) because aortic valve complex calcification is important for stable anchoring of the prosthesis. Therefore, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for non-calcified AS is not preferred. However, a universally accepted strategy for TAVI in such patients is not yet established.
CASE SUMMARY: A 69-year-old woman with symptomatic severe AS and a high surgical risk was admitted to our institution for TAVI. Pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) revealed a non-calcified bicuspid aortic valve. Implantation of a 23 mm self-expandable valve (SEV) was planned according to the manufacturer's recommended optimal size based on CT measurements. Intraoperatively, the 23 mm SEV did not snugly fit at the aortic apparatus level. Thus, we deployed a 26 mm SEV with stable anchoring because of the stronger radial force. She was discharged without any complication. Echocardiography at 3 months follow-up showed a well-functioning transcatheter heart valve (THV) without migration or paravalvular leakage.
DISCUSSION: In our patient with non-calcified bicuspid AS, an SEV that was one size larger than the optimal as measured on CT was successfully implanted without THV embolization. An upsized SEV may be considered when performing TAVI in patients with severe non-calcified AS.
