Title: Lung Hypoplasia Associated With Ring-Sling Complex Is Usually Right-Sided.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary artery sling (PAS) is usually associated with long-segment congenital tracheal stenosis (LSCTS). This combination of abnormalities can also be associated with lung hypoplasia abnormalities (hypoplasia, aplasia, or agenesis). This study analyzed the association of lung hypoplasia abnormalities with combined PAS and LSCTS and its influence on its surgical outcomes.
METHODS: All patients (0 to 18 years) who underwent surgical procedures for both PAS and LSCTS from 1995 to 2019 were analyzed retrospectively for mortality, ventilation days, and intensive care unit days by dividing them into those with normal lungs (group 1) and hypoplastic lungs (group 2).
RESULTS: Included were 75 patients (30 girls [40%]), who were a median age of 5.7 months (interquartile range [IQR], 2.9-13.3 months), median weight of 5.5 kg (IQR, 4.1-7.9 kg), and had a median follow-up of 99.8 months (IQR, 54.5-152.0 months); of these, 8 patients (10.7%) had hypoplastic right lung, comprising hypoplasia in 7 (87.5%), aplasia in 1 (12.5%), and agenesis in 0 (0%). There was a significant difference in mortality (group 1, 9.0%; group 2, 50%; P = .007) but no significant difference in median ventilation days (group 1, 9.0; group 2, 9.0; P = .89) or in median intensive care unit days (group 1, 14.0; group 2, 11.5; P = .44).
CONCLUSIONS: Lung hypoplasia associated with PAS and LSCTS is usually right-sided. As a result of severe airway obstruction and single-lung physiology, there is a high requirement of preoperative cardiorespiratory support and a significant association with adverse surgical outcomes.
