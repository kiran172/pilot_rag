Title: First case report of fully robotically assisted lithotripsy in heavily calcified left main stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the standard-of-care treatment for left main stenosis as an alternative to bypass surgery. In addition, severe coronary lesion calcification can be modified by intravascular lithotripsy (IVL). However, with PCI and debulking treatment options, there are inherent limitations. PCI poses an increased health burden for the treating physician that is associated with wearing a heavy, lead-lined apron and being exposed to radiation. To overcome these issues, a robotically assisted angioplasty system (rPCI) was established that enables the operator to perform PCI remotely in routine clinical procedures. Furthermore, IVL have not been used remotely.
CASE SUMMARY: Here, we report the use of this technique for treating a heavily calcified left main stenosis in an 82-year-old male with previously diagnosed two-vessel coronary artery disease, progressive symptoms of dyspnoea at high cardio-vascular risk profile. The decision of the local heart team declined surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of successful rPCI combined with IVL.
DISCUSSION: In the case presented, rPCI was feasible and safe even in a complex lesion of the left main coronary artery requiring IVL. rPCI is a revolutionary new technique that may be applied to various types of coronary artery lesions.
