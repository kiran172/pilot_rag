Title: Vanishing Bone Metastases in 18F-FDG PET/CT.

Abstract: A 36-year-old woman with a history of large B-cell lymphoma was referred for the exploration of sclerotic bone thoracic vertebral metastases discovered on a contrast-enhanced CT examination. F-FDG PET showed no pathological uptake in the affected vertebrae, as well as normal vertebral density on the coupled unenhanced CT. After review of the initial contrast-enhanced CT, a left brachiocephalic vein stenosis was noted, leading to a retrograde contrast filling of the accessory hemiazygos vein and the capillary spaces within the vertebrae, mimicking sclerotic metastases.
