Title: Post-COVID-19 airway stenosis treated by tracheal resection and anastomosis: a bicentric experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The COVID-19 pandemic was an extraordinary challenge for the global healthcare system not only for the number of patients affected by pulmonary disease, but also for the incidence of long-term sequalae. In this regard, laryngo-tracheal stenosis (LTS) represents one of the most common complications of invasive ventilation.
METHODS: A case series of patients who underwent tracheal resection and anastomosis (TRA) for post-COVID-19 LTS was collected from June 2020 to September 2021.
RESULTS: Among 14 patients included, 50% had diabetes and 64.3% were obese. During intensive care unit stay, mean duration of orotracheal intubation (OTI) was 15.2 days and 10 patients (71.4%) underwent tracheostomy, which was maintained in 7 for an average of 31 days. According to the European Laryngological Society classification, 13 patients (92.9%) had a grade IIIa LTS and one a grade IIIa+. All patients underwent Type A TRA, according to the authors' classification. No major perioperative complications were reported and at the last follow-up all patients were asymptomatic.
CONCLUSIONS: With the appropriate indications, TRA represents an effective treatment in post-COVID-19 LTS patients. Short OTI times and careful tracheostomy are required in order to reduce the incidence of airway injury.
