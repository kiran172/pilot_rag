Title: Patient-Specific Computer Simulation to Predict Conduction Disturbance With Current-Generation Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patient-specific computer simulation may predict the development of conduction disturbance following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Validation of the computer simulations with current-generation devices has not been undertaken.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on patients who had undergone TAVR with a current-generation self-expanding transcatheter heart valve (THV). Preprocedural computed tomography imaging was used to create finite element models of the aortic root. Procedural contrast angiography was reviewed, and finite element analysis performed using a matching THV device size and implantation depth. A region of interest corresponding to the atrioventricular bundle and proximal left bundle branch was identified. The percentage of this area (contact pressure index [CPI]) and maximum contact pressure (CPMax) exerted by THV were recorded. Postprocedural electrocardiograms were reviewed, and major conduction disturbance was defined as the development of persistent left bundle branch block or high-degree atrioventricular block.
RESULTS: A total of 80 patients were included in the study. THVs were 23- to 29-mm Evolut PRO (n = 53) and 34-mm Evolut R (n = 27). Major conduction disturbance occurred in 27 patients (33.8%). CPI (28.3 ± 15.8 vs. 15.6 ± 11.2%; p &lt; 0.001) and CPMax (0.51 ± 0.20 vs. 0.36 ± 0.24 MPa; p = 0.008) were higher in patients who developed major conduction disturbance. CPI (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.74; 95% CI, 0.63-0.86; p &lt; 0.001) and CPMax (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.81; p = 0.006) demonstrated a discriminatory power to predict the development of major conduction disturbance.
CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific computer simulation may identify patients at risk for conduction disturbance after TAVR with current-generation self-expanding THVs.
