Title: Hemodynamic Characteristics of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis: A Pilot Study of Contrast Enhancement Time-Density Curves Based on Regions of Interest.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to analyze the hemodynamic characteristics of occluded vessels responsible for acute ischemic stroke and to diagnose the occlusion types.
METHODS: Multimodal computed tomography (CT) was used to accurately identify the range of occlusion of large intracranial vessels. Regions of interest (ROI 1-3 ) were manually delineated at sites 2 mm away from the proximal, middle, and distal portions of each occlusion, generating 3 contrast enhancement time-density curves. The peak CT attenuation values, or Hounsfield units (H 1-3 ), and time-to-peak values (T 1-3 ) were extracted from each curve. H 0 and T 0 of the time-density curve, based on ROI 0 of the automatically recognized input artery, were used as the baseline values with which the odds ratios of each parameter, H 1-3/0 and T 1-3/0 , were obtained. The present study aimed to establish prediction models for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) based on each ROI's time-density curve.
RESULTS: Among the 33 acutely occluded intracranial vessels, 10 were found to have ICAS, whereas 23 did not, based on the diagnostic criteria. Significant differences were observed in patient sex, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio upon admission, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score 24-48 hours after reperfusion therapy, and H 1/0 , H 3/0 , and T 3/0 between the ICAS and non-ICAS groups ( P < 0.05). The prediction model (model 3) based on the ROI 3 time-density curve showed the best performance for the diagnosis of ICAS (area under the curve, 0.944; 95% confidence interval, 0.854-1.000). The prediction models based on ROI 1 (model 1) and ROI 2 (model 2) showed moderate diagnostic performance (area under the curve, 0.817 vs 0.822, respectively). The best visualization for proximal occlusions was in the first phase (arterial phase) of multiphase CT angiography, and in the second phase (early venous phase) for distal occlusions.
CONCLUSIONS: The contrast enhancement time-density curves of the ROIs at all evaluated portions of the acute ischemic stroke occlusions provided a visual display of the blood flow characteristics of the responsible vessels. The time-density curve of the ROI placed 2 mm from the distal occlusion was a combined effect of residual blood flow and collateral establishment, thus providing good performance for the diagnosis of ICAS.
