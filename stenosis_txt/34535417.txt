Title: Coronary artery disease in adults with Noonan syndrome: Case series and literature review.

Abstract: Noonan syndrome (NS) is a genetic disorder characterized by facial dysmorphism, congenital heart disease, and short stature. In very rare cases, patients with this syndrome have coronary disease. Their management and prognosis are currently unclear. We have described 4 cases of coronary aneurysms/coronary ectasia and 1 case of a single coronary artery in patients with adult Noonan syndrome, followed in a medical and surgical center of adult congenital heart disease. The average age was 49.4years old. The majority of them had both pulmonary stenosis and interauricular communication. None had symptoms of angina, at rest, or with stress. Only one patient who had any structural heart disease, had a thrombotic complication with chronic occlusion of the right coronary and anterior inter ventricular artery, fortuitous finding, with no ischemic signs to functional tests, treated only with anti-vitamin K. Finally, any deaths have also been reported in our series. Coronary artery diseases essentially coronary aneurysm/ectasia remain a rare condition in adult patients with NS. Evolution is unknown and complications such as coronary artery thrombosis do not necessarily require surgical treatment.
