Title: Association of the location and initial degree of malignant central airway stenosis with the risk of severe restenosis after interventional bronchoscopy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Therapeutic bronchoscopy is one of the effective methods in the treatment and management of malignant central airway stenosis (MCAS). However, restenosis after therapeutic bronchoscopy frequently occurs and severe restenosis (SR) can be life-threatening. Therefore, this study aimed at investigating the risk factors for SR after therapeutic bronchoscopy.
METHODS: The data of 233 consecutive cases with MCAS who were subjected to therapeutic bronchoscopy between 2015 and 2020 at a tertiary hospital were collected. Patients were divided into SR group and non-SR during 6 months after therapeutic bronchoscopy. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for SR.
RESULTS: SR during 6 months after therapeutic bronchoscopy occurred in 39.5% (92/233) of patients. The location and the initial degree of MCAS were associated with SR, as assessed by multiple logistic regression analysis (P < 0.05). The risk of SR after therapeutic bronchoscopy in the left main bronchus, right main bronchus, and right intermediate bronchus increased, compared to the risk when of MCAS was located in the trachea (OR (95% CI) of 8.821 (1.850-25.148), 6.583 (1.791-24.189), and 3.350 (0.831-13.511), respectively). In addition, the initial degree of MCAS was positively associated with an increased risk of SR (OR 1.020; 95% CI 1.006-1.035).
CONCLUSIONS: MCAS located in the left main bronchus, right main bronchus and right intermediate bronchus, as well as the higher initial degree of MCAS were independent risk factors for SR during 6 months after therapeutic bronchoscopy.
