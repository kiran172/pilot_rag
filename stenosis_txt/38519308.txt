Title: FAPI-PET in Cardiovascular Disease.

Abstract: PET probes targeting fibroblasts are frequently used for varying applications in oncology. In recent years, the clinical spectrum has been expanded towards cardiovascular medicine, e.g., after myocardial infarction, in aortic stenosis or as a non-invasive read-out of atherosclerosis. We herein provide a brief overview of the current status of this PET radiotracer in the context of cardiovascular disease, including translational and clinical evidence. In addition, we will also briefly discuss future applications, e.g., the use of fibroblast-targeting PET to investigate bilateral organ function along the cardiorenal axis.
