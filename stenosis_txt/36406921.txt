Title: Valve-in-Mitral Annular Calcification Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement After Thrombosis of Extracardiac Valved Conduit.

Abstract: We report a patient with severe mitral annular calcification, mitral stenosis/regurgitation, hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, and subaortic membrane treated with valved left atrium-left ventricle conduit, septal myectomy, and membrane resection. Subsequent thrombosis of the conduit prompted successful valve-in- mitral annular calcification transcatheter mitral valve replacement and laceration of the anterior mitral leaflet to prevent outflow obstruction. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
