Title: Aortic valve and vascular calcium score in pre-TAVI CT: correlation with early post-procedural complications.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of early complications after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) and their correlation with the Calcium Score (CS) of the aortic valve, aorta and ilio-femoral arteries derived from pre-procedural computed tomography (CT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 226 patients (100 males, mean age 79.4 ± 6.7 years) undergoing 64-slice CT for pre-TAVI evaluation from January 2018 to April 2021. The population was divided into CS quartiles.
RESULTS: Overall, 173 patients underwent TAVI procedure, of whom 61% presented paravalvular leak after the procedure, 28% presented bleeding or vascular complications, 25% presented atrioventricular block, and 8% developed acute kidney injury. The prevalence of paravalvular leak and vascular complications was higher in the upper CS quartiles for aortic valve and ilio-femoral arteries.
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic valve and vascular CS could help to predict post-TAVI early complications.
