Title: Long-term patency of rescue stenting of an anomalous left circumflex coronary artery after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in the setting of an anomalous left circumflex coronary artery (LCX) has had a variety of outcomes. Most commonly an anomalous LCX originates as a separate ostium arising from the right coronary sinus or is found branching off of the proximal right coronary artery. The artery courses around the aortic annulus before taking the course seen in typical anatomy. Given this deviation from typical anatomy and increased aortic annulus pressure by the replacement valve, there is an increased risk of a complication such as acute coronary artery occlusion. Special consideration and preparation are needed to prevent adverse outcomes, including death. We report a case in which intraprocedural anomalous LCX rescue stenting proved to be effective for treatment of acute coronary occlusion. Follow-up angiography provided an opportunity to demonstrate long-term patency in rescue stenting during TAVR.
