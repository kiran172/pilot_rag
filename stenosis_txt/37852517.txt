Title: Characteristics of patients with recurrent acute myocardial infarction after MINOCA.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myocardial infarction (MI) with non-obstructed coronary arteries (MINOCA) is an increasingly recognized condition with challenging management. Some MINOCA patients ultimately experience recurrent acute MI (re-AMI) during follow-up; however, clinical and angiographic factors predisposing to re-AMI are still poorly defined.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter cohort study we enrolled consecutive patients fulfilling diagnostic criteria of MINOCA according to the IV universal definition of myocardial infarction; characteristics of patients experiencing re-AMI during the follow-up were compared to a group of MINOCA patients without re-AMI.
RESULTS: 54 patients (mean age 66 ± 13) experienced a subsequent re-AMI after MINOCA and follow-up was available in 44 (81%). Compared to MINOCA patients without re-AMI (n = 695), on first invasive coronary angiography (ICA) MINOCA patients with re-AMI showed less frequent angiographically normal coronaries (37 versus 53%, p = 0.032) and had a higher prevalence of atherosclerosis involving 3 vessels or left main stem (17% versus 8%, p = 0.049). Twenty-four patients (44%) with re-AMI underwent a new ICA: 25% had normal coronary arteries, 12.5% had mild luminal irregularities (<30%), 20.8% had moderate coronary atherosclerosis (30-49%), and 41.7% showed obstructive coronary atherosclerosis (≥50% stenosis). Among patients undergoing new ICA, atherosclerosis progression was observed in 11 (45.8%), 37.5% received revascularization, only 4.5% had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL_C) under 55 mg/dL and 33% experienced a new cardiovascular disease (CVD) event (death, AMI, heart failure, stroke) at subsequent follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, only a minority of MINOCA patients with re-AMI underwent a repeated ICA, nearly one out of two showed atherosclerosis progression, often requiring revascularization. Recommended LDL-C levels were achieved only in a minority of the cases, indicating a possible underestimation of CVD risk in this population.
