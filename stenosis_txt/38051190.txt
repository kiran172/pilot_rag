Title: Comparison of Photon-counting Detector and Energy-integrating Detector CT for Visual Estimation of Coronary Percent Luminal Stenosis.

Abstract: Background Compared with energy-integrating detector (EID) CT, the improved resolution of photon-counting detector (PCD) CT coupled with high-energy virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) has been shown to decrease calcium blooming on images in phantoms and cadaveric specimens. Purpose To determine the impact of dual-source PCD CT on visual and quantitative estimation of percent diameter luminal stenosis compared with dual-source EID CT in patients. Materials and Methods This prospective study recruited consecutive adult patients from an outpatient facility between January and March 2022. Study participants underwent clinical dual-source EID coronary CT angiography followed by a research dual-source PCD CT examination. For PCD CT, multienergy data were used to create VMIs at 50 and 100 keV. Two readers independently reviewed EID CT images followed by PCD CT images after a washout period. Readers visually graded the most severe stenosis in terms of percent diameter luminal stenosis for the left main, left anterior descending, right, and circumflex coronary arteries, unblinded to scanner type. Quantitative measures of percent stenosis were made using commercial software. Visual and quantitative estimates of percent stenosis were compared between EID CT and PCD CT using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Results A total of 25 participants (median age, 59 years [range, 18-78 years]; 16 male participants) were enrolled. On EID CT images, readers 1 and 2 identified 39 and 32 luminal stenoses, respectively, with a percent diameter luminal stenosis greater than 0%. Visual estimates of percent stenosis were lower on PCD CT images than EID CT images (reader 1: median 20.6% [IQR, 8.8%-61.2%] vs 31.8% [IQR, 12.9%-69.7%], P &lt; .001; reader 2: 6.5% [IQR, 0.4%-54.1%] vs 22.9% [IQR, 1.8%-67.4%], P = .002). No difference was observed between EID CT and PCD CT for quantitative measures of percent stenosis (median difference, -1.5% [95% CI: -3.0%, 2.5%]; P = .51). Conclusion Relative to using EID CT, using PCD CT led to decreases in visual estimates of percent stenosis. Â© RSNA, 2023 See also the editorial by Murphy and Donnelly in this issue.
