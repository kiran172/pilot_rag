Title: Standardized approach to result analysis and interpretation of initial experience of coronary computed tomography angiography in a tertiary care hospital.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To have a systematic standardized approach to performing and interpretation of coronary CT Angiography (CTA) in order to maintain and enhance the diagnostic accuracy of the imaging modality.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study was performed in Radiology Department, Lady Reading Hospital, Medical Teaching Institute, Peshawar, Pakistan from August 2018 to September 2019. Patients referred for coronary CT angiography were screened and prepared in radiology department. The examination was performed on Toshiba-160 slice CT Scanner (Prime Aquilion) utilizing standardized protocols tailored towards optimum image acquisition. Interpretation of the images were based on the guidelines provided by the Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (SCCT).
RESULTS: Total 95 CTCA procedures were performed in the department, out of which 85 were included in study showing 49(57%) as normal and 36(42%) were positive for coronary disease. Of the abnormal cases 16(18.8%) had mild disease, nine (10.6%) patients had moderate disease, while severe disease was noted in 11 (12.9%) cases. Coronary quantitative stenosis revealed five cases (5.9%) with LAD involvement only and five (5.9%) with severe triple vessel disease. The remaining varied in degree of stenosis and number of segments involved. Post CABG were 14 cases (16%) and native arteries showed triple vessel disease. CTA for percutaneous stent patency were three (3.5%) cases with 100% stent patency.
CONCLUSION: Patient selection with tailored protocols are the mainstay for achieving optimal images. This form the basis for accurate interpretation, based on a standardized and systematic approach, utilizing various post processing tools, in order to maintain the high diagnostic accuracy of this semi-invasive, safe imaging modality in a variety of patients suspected of coronary artery disease, coronary artery bypass grafts and stent patency.
