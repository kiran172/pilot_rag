Title: Use of a Paclitaxel Drug-Eluting Stent for the Treatment of Hemodialysis Access Outflow Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the outcomes and durability of drug-eluting stents (DESs) for the treatment of hemodialysis access outflow stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-center retrospective analysis was conducted of all patients with hemodialysis vascular access outflow stenosis treated with a paclitaxel-coated DES (Eluvia; Boston Scientific, Marlborough, Massachusetts) between January 2020 and July 2022. A total of 34 DESs were implanted to treat outflow stenosis in 32 patients. Primary target lesion patency after stent deployment was the main outcome. Comparison between the time interval free from target lesion reintervention (TLR) after previous plain balloon angioplasty (PBA) and that after stent deployment for the same target lesion was considered a secondary outcome.
RESULTS: The primary patency at 6, 12, and 18 months was 63.1%, 47.6%, and 41.7%, respectively. The secondary patency rate was 100% at 18 months. The median time interval free from TLR increased from 4.1 to 11.9 months (P < .001). No adverse events were observed during the median follow-up period of 387 days.
CONCLUSIONS: The patency rates after use of DES for hemodialysis access outflow stenosis were comparable with results for drug-coated balloons and stent grafts, addressing recoil and minimizing the risk of jailing by a covered stent.
