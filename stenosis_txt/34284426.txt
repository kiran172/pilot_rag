Title: Update on the Long-Term Outcomes Following the Management of Incomplete Punctal Canalization.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To study the clinical profile, associated lacrimal disorders, and long-term outcomes following a membranotomy, in patients with incomplete punctal canalization (IPC).
METHODS: Retrospective interventional study was performed of all the patients diagnosed with IPC during the study period over 5 years from January 2015 to December 2020. The diagnosis of IPC was made based on the earlier published guidelines. A combination of rapid and slow taper Nettleship's punctal dilators were used for an effective membranotomy, followed by further assessment of the lacrimal drainage passage. Appropriate interventions for associated lacrimal disorders were performed. Data collected on chart reviews include demographics, clinical presentation, laterality, type of IPC, associated lacrimal anomalies, management modalities, and long-term outcomes.
RESULTS: Ninety-eight puncta of 62 eyes of 46 patients with IPC were examined in the clinic. Incomplete punctal canalization-external membrane variant was seen in 62% (61/98) and internal membrane variant in 38% (37/98). Seventy-eight puncta (78/98, 79.5%) in 39 patients underwent membranotomy using Nettleship's punctal dilator. Associated lacrimal drainage pathway deformities were seen in 31% of patients (12/39). Three puncta had mini-monoka insertion for associated canalicular stenosis and canalicular obstruction. Five patients with associated congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction underwent probing, of which 3 patients needed dacryocystorhinostomy for complex congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Associated punctal agenesis was noted in 3 patients involving the other punctum of the same eye. Canalicular wall hypoplasia involving 3 walls of the canaliculus was seen in 1 patient. At a mean follow up of 28 months, the anatomical and functional outcomes were noted in 100% and 97.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term outcomes of membranotomy for IPC are excellent. Associated congenital lacrimal drainage anomalies are common with IPC.
