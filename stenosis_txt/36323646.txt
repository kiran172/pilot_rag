Title: Early detection of anastomotic leak with C-reactive protein increases the chances of anastomotic salvage.

Abstract: AIM: Anastomotic leak results in increased morbidity and affects functional and oncological outcomes after colectomy. Measurement of C-reactive protein (CRP) allows early detection of anastomotic leaks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the benefit to the patient of earlier diagnosis and management of anastomotic leaks, namely avoiding takedown of the anastomosis.
METHOD: Patients with an anastomotic fistula after elective colorectal surgery from 2010 to 2020 were included. Three periods were defined according to progressive adherence to the CRP protocol in our department. A comparison was made between the periods 'before' (2010-2013) and 'after' (2016-2020) in terms of morbidity, mortality, anastomotic salvage, days spent in hospital within the first postoperative month, timely adjuvant chemotherapy and anastomotic stenosis.
RESULTS: Out of 2655 elective colorectal operations, 171 patients presented with an anastomotic leak and 123 patients were included in the study. In univariate analysis, patients in the 'after' group had fewer severe complications (Clavien-Dindo Grade III to IV, 66.7% vs. 56.9; p = 0.017); the difference did not reach significance regarding timely postoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.058) and anastomotic stenosis (p = 0.682). In both, univariate and multivariate analysis, the 'after' period increased the chances of preserving the anastomosis (OR = 2.37 [1.08-5.17]) and increased the number of days out of hospital (p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSION: A CRP-based protocol for the screening of anastomotic leaks after colorectal surgery was related to increased anastomotic conservation, a decreased impact and severity of the leak and a shorter length of hospital stay.
