Title: Cystic adventitial disease of popliteal artery, the both sides of the coin: Arterial resection vs cyst excision.

Abstract: Adventitial cystic disease (ACD) is a rare form of non-atherosclerotic arterial stenosis. This entity accounts only for 0.1% of all vascular diseases and affects the popliteal artery unilaterally in 85% of the cases. The options for treatment ACD include excision of cysts, removal of the affected arterial segment with vein graft reconstruction or radiological aspiration. We present two cases of ACD of the popliteal artery and its subsequent management and discuss the pros and cons of the treatment's strategies.
