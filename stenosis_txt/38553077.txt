Title: Prognostic impact of combined non-severe aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation on clinical outcomes: a single-centre retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Though the concomitant occurrence of non-severe aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR) is highly prevalent, there are limited data to guide clinical decision-making in this condition. Here, we attempt to determine an aortic valve area (AVA) cut-off value associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with combined non-severe AS and MR.
METHODS: Single-centre, retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent echocardiography examination between 2010 and 2021 with evidence of combined non-severe AS and MR. We excluded patients with ≥moderate aortic valve regurgitation or mitral stenosis, as well as patients who underwent any aortic or mitral intervention either prior or following our assessment (n=372).
RESULTS: The final cohort consisted of 2933 patients with non-severe AS, 506 of them with >mild MR. Patients with both pathologies had lower cardiac output and worse diastolic function.Patients with an AVA ≤1.35 cm² in the presence of >mild MR had the highest rates of heart failure (HF) hospitalisations (HR 3.1, IQR 2.4-4, p<0.001) or mortality (HR 2, IQR 1.8-2.4, p<0.001), which remained significant after adjusting for clinical and echocardiographic parameters.
CONCLUSION: Patients with combined non-severe AS and MR have a higher rate of HF hospitalisations and mortality. An AVA≤1.35 cm² in the presence of >mild MR is associated with worse clinical outcomes.
