Title: Kawasaki disease or polyarteritis nodosa: coronary involvement, a diagnostic conundrum.

Abstract: Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a medium-vessel vasculitis presenting with cutaneous and multisystem involvement with considerable morbidity. The necrotizing vasculitis in PAN typically involves renal, celiac, and mesenteric vascular beds. Coronary artery involvement is a characteristic feature of Kawasaki disease, another medium-vessel vasculitis; however, it has been rarely reported with PAN. Here, we present 2 cases with PAN involving coronaries mimicking Kawasaki disease. A 3.5-year-old boy with classical features of Kawasaki disease with giant coronary aneurysm refractory to IVIg, methylprednisolone, infliximab presented with persistent rise in inflammatory markers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) revealed celiac artery branches stenosis and beading suggestive of PAN. Another 2-year-old girl presented with persistent fever, abdominal pain, and distension. She had hypertension, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly on examination. Echocardiography revealed multiple coronary aneurysms and DSA revealed numerous renal artery aneurysms. Coronary aneurysm although is a rare presentation of childhood PAN, and can mimic Kawasaki disease. Although both are medium-vessel vasculitis differentiation between these two entities is pivotal, as there are differences in treatment modalities, duration of immunomodulatory therapy, and the outcome. This manuscript describes the salient differences which can help differentiate PAN masquerading as Kawasaki disease at initial presentation.
