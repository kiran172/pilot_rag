Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement for structural degeneration of previously implanted transcatheter valves (TAVR-in-TAVR): a systematic review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) represents a valid treatment for patients with aortic valve stenosis and high or intermediate surgical risk. However, biological transcatheter valves can also experience a structural degeneration after years, and a redo-TAVR procedure (TAVR-in-TAVR) can be a valid option. We revised the current available literature for indications, procedural and technical details and outcome on TAVR-in-TAVR procedures for degenerated TAVR valves.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in the public medical database for scientific articles on TAVR-in-TAVR procedures for degenerated transcatheter valves. Data on demographics, indications, first and second transcatheter valve type and size, mortality, complications and follow-up were extracted and analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies (1 multicentre, 3 case series, 9 case reports) were included in this review, with a total amount of 160 patients treated with TAVR-in-TAVR procedures for transcatheter valve failure. The mean age was 74.8 ± 7.8 with 84 males (52.8%). The mean elapsed time from the first TAVR procedure was 58.1 ± 23.4 months. Main indication for TAVR-in-TAVR was pure stenosis (38.4%, with mean gradient of 44.5 ± 18.5 mmHg), regurgitation (31.4%), mixed stenosis and regurgitation (29.5%) and leaflet thrombosis (8.8%). Procedural success rate was 86.8%, with second TAVR valve malposition occurred in 4 cases (2.5%). The hospital mortality rate was 1.25% (2/160). Post-procedural echocardiographic control showed moderate regurgitation in 5.6% of patients (9/160) and residual transvalvular mean gradient ≥20 mmHg in 5% of cases. Postoperative complications included major vascular complications (8.7%), new pacemaker implantation (8.7%), acute kidney failure (3.7%), stroke (0.6%) and coronary obstruction (0.6%). The mean follow-up time was 6 ± 5.6 months with 1 non-cardiovascular death reported.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR-in-TAVR represents a valid alternative to standard surgery for the treatment of degenerated transcatheter valves in high-risk patients. Despite these promising results, further studies are required to assess durability and haemodynamic performances of the second TAVR valve.
