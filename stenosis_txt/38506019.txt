Title: [Balloon dilation as an alternative to tracheotomy for acquired subglottic stenosis in children of the first year of life].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy and safety of balloon dilation as the first choice method in the treatment of children of the first year of life with acquired subglottic stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the treatment of 25 patients aged 27 days to 11 months of life (average age 5.3Â±3.76 months) with subglottic stenosis caused by prolonged intubation, in whom balloon dilation was the first method of treatment. Grade III Cotton-Myer stenosis was preoperatively detected in 22 children, the remaining 3 had grade II stenosis.
RESULTS: The success rate of balloon dilation was 100%; tracheotomy was not required in any case, the absence of stenosis during a follow-up examination in the catamnesis was recorded in 14 (56%) children, the remaining 11 (44%) had grade 0-I stenosis and did not cause respiratory disorders. In 1 child (1.5 years old), a subglottic cyst was removed after balloon dilation. One dilation was required in 18 (72%) children, two - in 5 (20%), three and four - respectively for 1 patient. If additional intervention was necessary, the operation was repeated 10 days - 3 months after the previous one. There were no postoperative complications.
CONCLUSION: Balloon dilation is a highly effective and safe alternative to traditional surgical interventions for acquired subglottic stenosis in children of the first year of life and can be recommended as a method of first choice.
