Title: Annular rupture during transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a long-term corticosteroid user: a case report.

Abstract: A 74-year-old woman with a history of interstitial pneumonia, who had been taking oral corticosteroids for the past 9 years, was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis. The patient underwent transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a balloon-expandable valve under local anesthesia. After deploying a 26-mm SAPIEN 3 valve with 1.5 ml less balloon inflation, transesophageal echocardiography revealed a hemorrhage in the aortic annulus. Intraoperative angiography revealed a small contrast leakage around the ascending aorta. Emergent surgical aortic valve replacement was performed successfully, with a tear at the non-left commissure closed using interrupted sutures. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 14 with no paravalvular leakage. Chronic corticosteroid use may be a risk factor for annular ruptures during TAVR. Careful balloon dilation may be necessary, especially when balloon-expandable valves are used in patients receiving long-term corticosteroids.
