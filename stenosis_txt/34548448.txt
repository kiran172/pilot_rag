Title: [Fontan Procedure in Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome:for Better Establishment of Fontan Circulation].

Abstract: Recently, the number of patients with hypoplastic left heart syndrome reaching the final stage of Fontan operation is increasing due to the systematization of staged therapies including bilateral pulmonary artery banding. However, in case, the systemic and pulmonary circulatory pathways initially formed by the Norwood procedure are not always sufficient to obtain a good Fontan circulation. In particular, depending on the method of reconstruction of the aortic arch, aortic re-coarctation may result in increased ventricular afterload. Furthermore, inadequate aortopulmonary space causes pulmonary artery stenosis, which increases the resistance of the pulmonary artery. In addition, tricuspid regurgitation and increased collateral circulation due to the synergistic effects of multiple reoperations and cyanosis can worsen cardiac function due to increased volume load and further increase pulmonary vascular resistance, preventing the establishment of a good Fontan circulation. In order to resolve these factors before Fontan operation and establish a better Fontan circulation, it is important to develop a comprehensive treatment strategy as well as a step-by-step surgical treatment strategy.
