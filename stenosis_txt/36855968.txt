Title: Revascularization methods in patients with carotid stenosis and concomitant coronary heart disease.

Abstract: A major feature of the atherosclerotic process is its systemic and progressive character. The plaque pathogenetic mechanisms, morphology, evolution, and predilection site (bifurcation zones) determine the frequent coincidence of carotid and coronary atherosclerosis in the same patient.The present overview chronologically traces the history, effectiveness, and benefit of surgical and continuously improving interventional carotid revascularization. It thereby analyzes the indications, results, and complications based on a number of randomized clinical trials, industry-sponsored registries, and large single-center series in the last 3 decades. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and percutaneous carotid angioplasty (CAS) have evolved from 'dubious' procedures to a modern strategy resulting in a significantly lower incidence of stroke and death compared to medical treatment only. Although almost every second patient with carotid stenosis and indications for CAS has coronary atherosclerosis, studies on therapeutic modeling in such a combination are few, showing controversial results. Having both CHD and CS doubles the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, HF, and death. An isolated revascularization approach compromises the results of therapeutic strategies and worsens patient survival. The high risk associated with coronary heart disease in CAS and CEA is a fact and minimization requires both an individualized and uniform stepwise revascularization strategy.
