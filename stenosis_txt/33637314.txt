Title: Spectrum of coronary angiographic findings in patients with ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) undergoing primary PCI in a tertiary care center of Nepal.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Even in developing countries like Nepal, prevalence of ST-elevation myocardial infarction has been shown to be increased with rise in prevalence of conventional risk factors like diabetes, Hypertension, smoking, dyslipidemia and obesity. Our aim is to retrospectively analyze for various risk factors and angiographic patterns of coronary artery disease in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction undergoing Primary Percutaneous Intervention.
RESULTS: During the period of 1 year (January 2019 to December 2019), 816 patients presented to our ER with acute STEMI, among them 437 (53.6%) patients underwent primary PCI strategy and among them 22 (5.3%) patients were died. Thirty-six (4.4%) patients received thrombolysis, among them 5 (13.9%) patients were died while remaining 343 (42.0%) patients were managed conservatively and among them 20 (5.8%) were died. The mean age of patient who underwent primary PCI was 58.5Â±12.7 years range from 25 years to 99 years. Among them 55-75 years old 217 (49.6%) were highest in number followed by<55 years old 180 (41.2%). Males 318 (72.8%) were predominant. Among those who underwent primary PCI, hypertension 214 (49%) was the most common risk factor, followed by smoking 198 (45.3%), diabetes mellitus 123 (28.1%), dyslipidemia 53 (12.1%) and family history of premature coronary artery disease 18 (4.1%). Among those patients, 292 patients (66.8%) had single vessel disease, 99 patients (22.7%) had double vessel disease, 41 patients (9.3%) had triple vessel disease and 5 patients (1.1%) had non-significant coronary artery stenosis. Left anterior descending (53.3%) was the most frequently found culprit artery, followed by right coronary artery, left circumflex, ramus intermedius and left main artery.
CONCLUSION: Fifty percent of patients presented with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction and underwent primary PCI were between 55-75 years of age. Hypertension and smoking were the most common risk factors present in those patients. Single vessel disease was most prevalent with left anterior descending found to be the most commonly involved coronary artery followed by right coronary artery and left circumflex.
