Title: [Endovascular Therapy for Peripheral Artery Disease - Therapeutic Options for Treatment of Severe Calcification].

Abstract: Calcified lesions are a major limitation of endovascular therapy of peripheral artery disease. Recently published studies evaluating the impact of lithotripsy (Disrupt III) and directional atherectomy (REALITY) as vessel preparation devices for calcified femoro-popliteal lesions prior to the final treatment with drug-coated balloons (DCB). Disrupt III, a randomized controlled trial comparing lithotripsy and regular balloon angioplasty for vessel preparation prior to DCB, and REALITY, a single-arm study of directional atherectomy prior to DCB angioplasty resulted in low provisional stent and dissection rates. Moreover, lithotripsy did result in a better 2-year patency rate as compared to predilatation with a regular balloon. Importantly, both vessel preparation strategies resulted in a low rate of post-procedural residual stenosis of >30%, the major predictor for loss of patency following DCB angioplasty in long-term.Lithotripsy is an emerging therapy concept for vessel preparation of calcified pelvic arteries prior to trans-femoral aortic valve implantation.In summary, vessel preparation of calcified arterial lesions by improving vessel compliance or reducing the plaque load represent promising technical methods reducing provisional stent rates and improving longer-term outcomes.
