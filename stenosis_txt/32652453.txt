Title: Stenotic lesions of pulmonary arteries: imaging evaluation using multidetector computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: Stenotic lesions of the pulmonary arteries can be congenital or acquired. Different etiologies may affect the pulmonary arteries, unilaterally or bilaterally, at different levels. The clinical scenario, age of presentation and the precipitating event may provide clues to the underlying etiology. Diagnosis is important as these lesions may have hemodynamic and clinical consequences. Multidetector computed tomography angiography allows for accurate depiction of these lesions along with a comprehensive assessment of the pulmonary arterial wall, intra- or extraluminal involvement, associated cardiac or extracardiac anomalies, effects secondary to pulmonary stenosis on the cardiac chambers as well as associated causative or resultant lung parenchymal changes.
