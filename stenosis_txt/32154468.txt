Title: Transcarotid repair of carotid artery pseudoaneurysm after carotid artery endarterectomy with tandem distal internal carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: Pseudoaneurysm development after carotid endarterectomy is a rare occurrence. Even rarer is pseudoaneurysm formation associated with a distal carotid artery stenosis. We report the case of stent grafting of a carotid artery pseudoaneurysm and tandem high-grade distal stenosis through a transcarotid approach with active flow reversal. No reported cases of a transcarotid artery approach to address a carotid artery aneurysm with tandem stenosis were found in the literature. We show that it may be a safe alternative to a transfemoral artery approach or open surgery.
