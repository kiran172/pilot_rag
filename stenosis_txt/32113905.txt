Title: The alterations of mitochondrial DNA in coronary heart disease.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the major cause of death in modern society. CHD is characterized by atherosclerosis, which could lead to vascular cavity stenosis or obstruction, resulting in ischemic cardiac conditions such as angina and myocardial infarction. In terms of the mitochondrion, the main function is to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for cells. And the alterations (including mutations, altered copy number and haplogroups) of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) are associated with the abnormal expression of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) system, resulting in mitochondrial dysfunction, then leading to perturbation on the electron transport chain and increased ROS generation and reduction in ATP level, contributing to ATP-producing disorders and oxidative stress, which may further accelerate development or vulnerability of atherosclerosis and myocardial ischemic injury. Therefore, the mtDNA defects may play an important role in making an early diagnosis, identifying disease-specific biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and predicting outcomes for patients with atherosclerosis and CHD. In this review, we aim to summarize the contribution of mtDNA mutations, altered mtDNA copy number and mtDNA haplogroups on the occurrence and development of CHD.
