Title: Prognostic Implications of Baseline B-type Natriuretic Peptide in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels have been shown to predict outcomes in surgical aortic valve replacement patients. BNP levels have not been well studied in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The purpose of this study is to define the utility of baseline BNP levels in predicting short-term outcomes after TAVI. In this retrospective, observational, study from 2012 to 2019, we reviewed data on 1297 low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk patients who underwent TAVI. Patients were dichotomized into those with baseline BNP levels above or below 500 pg/ml. Our primary outcome was a composite of inpatient stroke and death. Our secondary outcome was a composite of 30-day stroke, death and readmission. There were 975 patients with a baseline BNP level of <500 pg/ml and of those, 2% had our primary composite outcome and 13% of patients had our secondary composite outcome. There were 322 patients with a baseline BNP level of ≥500 pg/ml and of those, 6% had our primary composite outcome and 19% of patients had our secondary composite outcome. Those with a baseline BNP level ≥500 pg/ml were 3.47 times more likely (confidence of interval [CI] 1.727, 6.993, p = 0.0005) to have our primary composite outcome and were 1.72 times more likely (CI 1.186, 2.506, p = 0.0043) to have our secondary composite outcome. In conclusion, after adjustments for discrepant baseline characteristics, baseline BNP levels were independently predictive of a composite of inpatient stroke or death and a composite of 30-day stroke, death or readmission after TAVI. Those low, intermediate and high-risk patients whose baseline BNP is ≥500 pg/ml may ultimately require closer post-TAVI monitoring.
