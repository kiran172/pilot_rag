Title: Spinous Process Inclination in Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis Individuals.

Abstract: The aim of this study is to determine the sagittal inclination of lumbar spinous processes (SPs) in individuals with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS). It is a retrospective computerized tomography (CT) study including 345 individuals divided into two groups: control (90 males, 90 females) and stenosis (80 males and 85 females. The SP inclination was measured in the midsagittal plane from L1 to L5 levels. Stenosis males (L3-L5) and females (L1, L4) manifested significantly greater SP inclination compared to their counterparts in the control group. Males had significantly horizontal SP orientation compared to females (L1, L2). We also found that SP inclination became steeper as we descend caudally. This study indicates that SP inclinations are significantly associated with DLSS.
