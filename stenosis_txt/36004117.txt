Title: Short-term outcomes of aortic valve neocuspidization for various aortic valve diseases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Bioprosthetic valve deterioration remains a major limitation following aortic valve replacement. Favorable results have been reported with an autologous pericardium aortic valve neocuspidization.
METHODS: Seventy patients (31 women and 39 men) (mean age, 62 ± 12 years) with aortic stenosis (n = 52 [74%]) or aortic regurgitation (n = 18 [26%]) underwent the aortic valve neocuspidization procedure. Thirty-four patients (49%) had a tricuspid valve, 35 (50%) had a bicuspid valve, and 1 (1%) had a monocuspid valve. European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation and Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores were, respectively, 2.2% ± 2% and 2.0% ± 1.8%. Four patients (6%) had active endocarditis and 2 (3%) had endocarditis sequelae. One patient (1%) had fibroelastoma. A combined procedure was performed in 33 patients (46%).
RESULTS: The follow-up period was 24 ± 12 months. One patient (1%) died in hospital and 1 patient (1%) underwent conventional valve replacement for significant aortic regurgitation. Postoperative peak and mean pressure gradients were respectively 14 ± 5 and 8 ± 3 mm Hg. Aortic valve area was 2.5 ± 0.6 cm2. During follow-up, no patients died. Reintervention occurred in 2 patients (3%). At last follow-up, peak pressure gradient was 13 ± 7 mm Hg, mean pressure gradient was 7 ± 4 mm Hg, and aortic valve area was 2.3 ± 0.7 cm2. There was 1 recurrence of moderate aortic stenosis (1%). All patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I (90%) or II (10%). Freedom from major valve-related events was 92.1%, (98.5% for death, 95.2% for reintervention, and 95.2% for endocarditis).
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the midterm outcomes of the aortic valve neocuspidization procedure with autologous glutaraldehyde fixed pericardium were acceptable for survival, operative risk and valve-related complications, for our all-comer patient population with various aortic valve diseases.
