Title: Impact of routine surveillance duplex ultrasound and subsequent reintervention after superficial femoral artery stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Superficial femoral artery (SFA) stenting is a common treatment for peripheral artery disease. It is effective in the short term; however, in-stent restenosis (ISR) limits long-term success. Surveillance with duplex ultrasound (DUS) can identify patients who develop ISR leading to early reintervention, but data to support this practice is sparce. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether surveillance and subsequent reintervention improves outcomes in patients with SFA stents.
METHODS: A single-center, retrospective study was performed with patients undergoing SFA stenting between 2005 and 2020 who had a follow-up with DUS. Five groups were identified based on the presence of ISR on DUS (ISR vs no ISR [NISR]), recurrence of symptoms (symptomatic [SX] vs asymptomatic [ASX]), and if any reintervention was performed (reintervention [R] vs no reintervention [NR]): (1) ISR+SX+R; (2) ISR+SX+NR; (3) ISR+ASX+R; (4) ISR+ASX+NR; and (5) NISR+NR. The primary endpoint was amputation-free survival, and the secondary endpoint was patency. Predictors of mortality and surveillance were identified by multivariable logistic regressions and Cox multivariate regression models. Survival curves were presented as Kaplan-Meier plots using log-rank test for subgroup comparison.
RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-seven patients were included in the analysis. The indication for intervention was claudication in 28% and chronic limb-threatening ischemia in 72%. A total of 161 patients (63%) underwent reintervention for ISR. Of patients who had restenosis on DUS, those who were symptomatic and did not undergo reintervention (ISR+SX+NR) did the worst, with 50% amputation rate. In contrast, those who were asymptomatic but did undergo reintervention (ISR+ASX+R) had the lowest amputation rate of 13%. Active smoking was a predictor of both loss of patency and amputation (1.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00-2.98; P = .050; 3.55; 95% CI, 1.53-8.25; P = .003). Post procedure dual antiplatelet therapy had a positive association with limb salvage (hazard ratio [HR], 0.23; 95% CI, 0.09-0.58; P = .001), whereas diabetes (HR, 2.61; 95% CI, 1.21-6.01; P = .019), stent occlusion (HR, 17.0; 95% CI, 5.93-63.1; P < .001), and chronic limb-threatening ischemia presentations (HR, 4.31; 95% CI, 1.86-11.7; P=.002) were negatively associated with limb salvage.
CONCLUSIONS: Routine surveillance DUS and subsequent reintervention on ISR after SFA stenting is associated with improved patency and amputation-free survival. Surveillance DUS should be routine for patients after stenting, with reintervention strongly considered if ISR is identified for both symptomatic and asymptomatic.
