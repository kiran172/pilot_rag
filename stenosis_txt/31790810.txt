Title: Termino-terminal Ureteral Laparoscopic Anastomosis in a Case of Deep Infiltrating Endometriosis.

Abstract: STUDY OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic termino-terminal ureteral anastomosis has all the advantages of a minimally invasive approach in addition to the treatment of the pathologic condition [1]. Ureteral deep endometriosis can lead to severe consequences, such as hydroureteronephrosis and renal failure [2,3]. The main objective of this video is to present our surgical strategy and technique for cases of ureteral deep infiltrating endometriosis, which could help surgeons to understand and perform this surgery in a safe way in patients.
DESIGN: Video demonstration of the technique.
SETTING: French university tertiary-care hospital.
INTERVENTIONS: This video presents a termino-terminal laparoscopic ureteral anastomosis and shows our team's strategy for surgical treatment in a 42-year-old woman with deep infiltrating ureteral left endometriosis, with consequent stenosis and left hydroureteronephrosis. A full resection of the endometriotic ureteral nodule was performed, followed by a termino-terminal anastomosis of the ureter. The use of intravenous indocyanine green to assess the postanastomotic ureteral perfusion and its risk of leakage or fistula are described in the video [2-5].
CONCLUSION: Ureteral endometriosis can lead to severe consequences, and the surgical treatment can be difficult and, most times, incomplete. This video gives a detailed example of the strategy our team used to perform a termino-terminal ureteral laparoscopic anastomosis in a structured way.
