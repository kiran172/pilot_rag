Title: 5-Year Outcomes of Drug-Coated Balloons for Peripheral Artery In-Stent Restenosis, Long Lesions, and CTOs.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long-term data on drug-coated balloon (DCB) outcomes in complex femoropopliteal atherosclerotic lesions are limited.
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to report 5-year safety and effectiveness outcomes of a paclitaxel DCB for the treatment of de novo in-stent restenosis (ISR), long lesions (LL), or chronic total occlusions (CTOs) in the prespecified imaging cohorts of the IN.PACT Global Study.
METHODS: The IN.PACT Global study was a prospective, international single-arm study. Assessments through 5 years included freedom from clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR), a safety composite (freedom from device- and procedure-related death to 30 days, and freedom from major target limb amputation and freedom from clinically driven target vessel revascularization within 60 months), and major adverse events.
RESULTS: The prespecified imaging cohorts enrolled 132 de novo ISR, 158 LL, and 127 CTO participants. Kaplan-Meier estimates of freedom from CD-TLR through 5 years were 58.0% (ISR), 67.3% (LL), and 69.8% (CTO). The cumulative incidences of the composite safety endpoint were 56.0% (ISR), 65.7% (LL), and 69.8% (CTO). The 5-year freedom from all-cause mortality with vital status update were 81.4% (ISR), 75.2% (LL), and 78.2% (CTO). Within the ISR cohort, 15.9% of participants experienced 2 or more TLRs, compared with 9.5% and 5.5% in the LL and CTO groups, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Results demonstrate long-term safety and effectiveness of this DCB in all 3 cohorts, with low reintervention rates in the LL and CTO cohorts and no safety issues. These results support the inclusion of this DCB into the treatment algorithm for complex femoropopliteal disease.
