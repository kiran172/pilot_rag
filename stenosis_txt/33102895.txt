Title: Dysphagia rates in single- and multiple-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery: a meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To conduct a meta-analysis to assess dysphagia complicating single-level and multiple-level (≥2) anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) surgery.
METHODS: Electronic searches were performed using four electronic databases from their inception to December 2017. Relevant studies reporting the rate of dysphagia as an endpoint for patients undergoing ACDF for degenerative disease, myelopathy, cervical canal stenosis or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament were identified according to prior inclusion and exclusion criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using a fixed effect model. P-scores were used to rank the levels of ACDF based on the rate of dysphagia. I2 was used to explore heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Ten studies were identified and included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, with a total of 4,018 patients identified; 2,362 patients underwent single-level ACDF, while 1,656 underwent multiple level (≥2 ACDF). The mean age ranged from 49.45 to 57.77 years. Mean follow-up time ranged from 2 days to 27.3 months. Overall, meta-analysis demonstrated a statistically significant higher dysphagia rate for multiple-level ACDF (6.6%) than for single-level ACDF (4%) (P heterogeneity =0.151, OR =1.42, 95% CI: 1.05-1.91, I2=32%).
CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia is a relatively common complication in the early postoperative period following ACDF and may cause patients significant discomfort and distress. This meta-analysis demonstrates a higher rate of dysphagia with multiple-level ACDF than with single-level ACDF at a period of 12-24 months.
