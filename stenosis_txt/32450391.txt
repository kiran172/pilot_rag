Title: Synthesis and evaluation of resveratrol derivatives as fetal hemoglobin inducers.

Abstract: Resveratrol (RVT) derivatives (10a-i) were designed, synthesized, and evaluated for their potential as gamma-globin inducers in treating Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) symptoms. All compounds were able to release NO at different levels ranging from 0 to 26.3%, while RVT did not demonstrate this effect. In vivo, the antinociceptive effect was characterized using an acetic acid-induced abdominal contortion model. All compounds exhibited different levels of protection, ranging from 5.9 to 37.3%; the compound 10a was the most potent among the series. At concentrations between 3.13 and 12.5 µM, the derivative 10a resulted in a reduction of 41.1-64.3% in the TNF-α levels in the supernatants of macrophages that were previously LPS-stimulated. This inhibitory effect was higher than that of RVT used as the control. In addition, the compound 10a and RVT induced double the production of the gamma-globin chains (γG + γA), compared to the vehicle, using CD34+ cells. Compound 10a also did not induce membrane perturbation and it was not mutagenic in the in vivo assay. Thus, compound 10a emerged as a new prototype of the gamma-globin-inducer group with additional analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities and proving to be a useful alternative to treat SCD symptoms.
