Title: Induction of dynamic hyperinflation by expiratory resistance breathing in healthy subjects - an efficacy and safety study.

Abstract: NEW FINDINGS: What is the central question of this study? The study aimed to establish a novel model to study the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-related cardiopulmonary effects of dynamic hyperinflation in healthy subjects. What is the main finding and its importance? A model of expiratory resistance breathing (ERB) was established in which dynamic hyperinflation was induced in healthy subjects, expressed both by lung volumes and intrathoracic pressures. ERB outperformed existing methods and represents an efficacious model to study cardiopulmonary mechanics of dynamic hyperinflation without potentially confounding factors as present in COPD.
ABSTRACT: Dynamic hyperinflation (DH) determines symptoms and prognosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The induction of DH is used to study cardiopulmonary mechanics in healthy subjects without COPD-related confounders like inflammation, hypoxic vasoconstriction and rarefication of pulmonary vasculature. Metronome-paced tachypnoea (MPT) has proven effective in inducing DH in healthy subjects, but does not account for airflow limitation. We aimed to establish a novel model incorporating airflow limitation by combining tachypnoea with an expiratory airway stenosis. We investigated this expiratory resistance breathing (ERB) model in 14 healthy subjects using different stenosis diameters to assess a dose-response relationship. Via cross-over design, we compared ERB to MPT in a random sequence. DH was quantified by inspiratory capacity (IC, litres) and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi, cmH<sub>2</sub> O). ERB induced a stepwise decreasing IC (means (95% CI): tidal breathing: 3.66 (3.45-3.88), ERB 3 mm: 3.33 (1.75-4.91), 2 mm: 2.05 (0.76-3.34), 1.5 mm: 0.73 (0.12-1.58) litres) and increasing PEEPi (tidal breathing: 0.70 (0.50-0.80), ERB 3 mm: 11.1 (7.0-15.2), 2 mm: 22.3 (17.1-27.6), 1.5 mm: 33.4 (3.40-63) cmH<sub>2</sub> O). All three MPT patterns increased PEEPi, but to a far lesser extent than ERB. No adverse events during ERB were noted. In conclusion, ERB was proven to be a safe and efficacious model for the induction of DH and might be used for the investigation of cardiopulmonary interaction in healthy subjects.
