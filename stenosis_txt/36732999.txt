Title: [A Case of Descending Colon Cancer with Virchow and Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis].

Abstract: A 72-year-old man was referred to our department with suspected intestinal obstruction. CT showed irregular descending colon wall thickening. Lower endoscopy showed severe descending colon stenosis. Biopsy results were group 1. FDG accumulation of significant SUV was found in the lymph nodes on the left supraclavicular region, left axilla, right mediastinum, posterior part of the right diaphragmatic leg, around the abdominal aorta, and in the liver. The accumulation in the descending colon was not definitely neoplastic. Consequently of left axillary lymph node biopsy, axillary lymph node metastasis of colorectal cancer was suspected, and laparoscopic left semicolon resection was performed. Among the simultaneous distant colorectal cancer metastases, Virchow's and left axillary lymph node metastases are extremely rare(0.1%). We report a case of descending colon cancer with simultaneous Virchow's and left axillary lymph node metastases, with some literature discussion.
