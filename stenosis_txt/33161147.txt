Title: Impact of Left-Ventricular Dysfunction in Patients With High- and Low- Gradient Severe Aortic Stenosis Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with high-gradient (HG) severe aortic stenosis (AS) and reduced left-ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF) are unknown.
METHODS: Patients undergoing TAVR for native severe AS between 2009 and 2018 were retrospectively included and classified into 3 groups: HG (≥ 40 mm Hg) and preserved EF (≥ 50%), HG low EF (< 50%), and low gradient (LG < 40 mm Hg) low EF. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiovascular mortality and readmission for heart failure at 1 year after TAVR.
RESULTS: Of the 526 patients included, 323 (61%) had HG preserved EF, 69 (13%) had HG low EF, and 134 (26%) had LG low EF. HG low EF group had higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation and heart failure and higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons score compared with the HG preserved EF group. Patients in the LG low EF group were older and had higher prevalence of coronary artery disease compared with those in the HG groups. All-cause mortality at 30 days (4.0%) was similar across the 3 groups. After adjustment, the risk of primary endpoint was similar in the HG low-EF vs preserved EF groups. Conversely, the risk of primary endpoint was higher in the LG low EF group vs the HG preserved EF group (hazard ratio [HR], 2.24; 95% confidence interval [CI],1.36-3.70; P = 0.002) and vs HG low EF group (HR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.55-7.90; P = 0.003), whereas the risk of all-cause mortality was similar across the 3 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The outcome of patients with HG low EF severe AS following TAVR is as good as that of patients with HG preserved EF.
