Title: [Efficacy and safety of Montgomery T-tube placement for benign complex subglottic tracheal stenosis: a retrospective analysis of 29 cases].

Abstract: Objective: To analyze the efficacy and safety of Montgomery T-tube (T-tube) placement for benign complex subglottic tracheal stenosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 29 patients with benign complex subglottic tracheal stenosis receiving T-tube placement in Beijing Tiantan Hospital from May 2015 to December 2019. The causes were postintubation tracheal stenosis [27 cases (93.1%), including 21 cases (72.4%) of tracheal stenosis after tracheotomy, 6 cases (20.7%) of tracheal stenosis after tracheal intubation], cervical post-traumatic tracheal stenosis (1 case, 3.4%) and tuberculous tracheal stenosis (1 case, 3.4%), respectively. Three-dimensional reconstruction of tracheal computerized tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy were used to grade the stenosis according to Cotton-Myer classification system before bronchoscopic intervention. The degree of stenosis was Cotton-Myer grade Ⅱ (7 cases, 24.1%), grade Ⅲ (11 cases, 37.9%) and grade Ⅳ (11 cases, 37.9%), respectively. All cases received placement of T-tubes and follow-up. Fisher's exact test was used for comparison between groups. Results: T-tube placement was performed 39 times in 29 patients. T-tubes were successfully placed for 24 cases (82.8%). The main complication during the operation was tracheal mucosal tear (6 cases, 20.7%), which resolved in all cases within 2 weeks. The main postoperative complication was secretion retention (27 cases, 93.1%), which was relieved after home nebulization treatment in 26 cases; and followed by granulation hyperplasia, especially located in T-tube upper margin (12 cases, 41.4%), of which 8 cases were cured after bronchoscopic intervention. None of the patients had T-tube migration. There were no statistically significant differences in the success rate of T-tube placement and the incidence of major complications in patients with benign complex subglottic tracheal stenosis with different degrees of stenosis. After 18 months to 24 months of follow-up, attempt was made to remove the T-tube in 9 patients but failed in 4 patients. The failure was due to collapse of the airway after the T-tube was removed. Conclusion: T-tube placement is a safe and reliable treatment for benign complex subglottic tracheal stenosis with high efficiency and manageable complications.
