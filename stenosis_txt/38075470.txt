Title: Surgical treatment of atlantoaxial dysplasia and scoliosis in spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita (SEDC) is a rare autosomal dominant hereditary disease caused by COL2A1 mutations. SEDC primarily involves the skeletal system, with typical clinical manifestations, including short stature, hip dysplasia, and spinal deformity. Due to the low incidence of SEDC, there are only a few case reports regarding the surgical treatment of SEDC complicated with spinal deformities.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a 16-year-old male patient with SEDC. He presented with typical short stature, atlantoaxial dysplasia, scoliosis, and hip dysplasia. Cervical magnetic resonance imaging showed spinal canal stenosis at the atlas level and cervical spinal cord compression with myelopathy. The scoliosis was a right thoracic curve with a Cobb angle of 65°. He underwent atlantoaxial reduction, decompression, and internal fixation from C1-C2 to relieve cervical myelopathy. Three months after cervical surgery, posterior correction surgery for scoliosis was performed from T3 to L4. Scoliosis was corrected from 66° to 8° and remained stable at 2-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case report of a patient with SEDC who successfully underwent surgery for atlantoaxial dysplasia and scoliosis. The study provides an important reference for the surgical treatment of SEDC complicated with spinal deformities.
