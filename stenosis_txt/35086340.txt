Title: The role of lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) in iatrogenic esophageal perforations secondary to endoscopic dilation of benign short esophageal strictures.

Abstract: 81 year-old male had an asymptomatic iatrogenic perforation after balloon dilation of esophageal strictures. After the migration of the full covered self expandable metal stent (FCSEMS), a lumen-apposing metal stent (LAMS) was placed and no esophageal leak was seen after. LAMS could be an appropiate first-line approach to benign short esophageal strictures complicated with iatrogenic small perforation but further prospective studies are needed.
