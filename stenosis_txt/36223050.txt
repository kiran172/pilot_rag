Title: Circulating Irisin Level as a Biomarker for Pure Aortic Stenosis and Aortic Valve Calcification.

Abstract: Irisin, a myokine mainly secreted by skeletal and cardiac muscles, is actively involved in cardiovascular diseases. However, whether irisin is associated with aortic stenosis remains unknown. Two hundred ninety-three severe AS patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation were enrolled and followed-up for 35 months on average. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to measure circulating irisin levels. Patients were divided into two groups based on the median plasma irisin level. We found that high plasma irisin levels were independently associated with pure aortic stenosis (PAS) after adjusting for age, body mass index, history of peripheral vascular disease, and creatinine (OR = 3.015, 95% CI 1.775-5.119, P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed a significant predictive value of irisin for PAS (AUC = 0.647, 95% CI 0.583-0.711, P < 0.001). The severity of aortic valve calcification was negatively associated with plasma irisin levels (P < 0.05). In conclusion, irisin is an independent predictor for PAS and is negatively associated with the severity of aortic valve calcification.
