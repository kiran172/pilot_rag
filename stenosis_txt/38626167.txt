Title: Analyzing lumbar vertebral shape and alignment in female patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis: Comparisons with spinal stenosis and risk factor exploration.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to examine the vertebral body shape characteristics and spondylopelvic alignment in L4 degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS) as well as the risk factors for the development of DS.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study compared vertebral morphology and sagittal spinopelvic alignment in female patients with lumbar DS and lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). The degree of lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), cross-sectional area (CSA), and vertebral body height ratio (ha/hp) of the lumbar spine were compared using full-length spine radiographs and computed tomography in 60 females with DS and in 60 women with LSS.
RESULTS: No significant differences in age or body mass index were observed between the two groups; however, the DS and LSS groups significantly differed in PI (mean, 58.9±10.8 vs. 47.2±11.6, P < 0.001), L4 CSA (mean, 1,166.2 m2 vs. 1,242.0 m2, P = 0.002) and ha/hp (mean, 1.134 vs. 1.007, P < 0.001). The L4 ha/hp was significantly higher in the DS group than in the LSS group. Additionally, LL values were negatively correlated with vertebral L5 CSA in the DS group (r = -0.28, P < 0.05). The LSS and DS groups demonstrated positive correlations between LL and L2, L3, and L4 ha/hp (r = 0.331, 0.267, and 0.317; P < 0.01, < 0.05, and < 0.05, respectively) and between LL and L4 and L5 ha/hp (r = 0.333, 0.331; P < 0.01, respectively). Multivariate regression analyses revealed that PI and ha/hp ratio may be independent predictors of DS development.
CONCLUSION: The DS group had significantly larger LL, PI, and L4 ha/hp and smaller L4 CSA than the LSS group. The lumbar vertebral body shape and sagittal spinopelvic alignment in females might be independent predictors of DS development.
