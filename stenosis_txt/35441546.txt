Title: Carotid Artery Stenting in Patients With Contralateral Carotid Occlusion Using a Combined Protection Method.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid artery stenting has become widespread as a revascularization method and has increasingly replaced carotid endarterectomy for treating internal carotid artery stenosis with contralateral carotid occlusion. Hence, this study aimed to establish the clinical characteristics and perioperative outcomes of carotid artery stenting for internal carotid artery stenosis in patients with contralateral carotid occlusion using a combined protection method.
METHODS: This retrospective single-center study assessed 218 patients with internal carotid artery stenosis who underwent carotid artery stenting using the dual protection (simultaneous flow reversal and distal filter) and blood aspiration method. We distinguished 2 patient groups: contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 11) and no contralateral carotid occlusion (n = 207). We evaluated the patients' characteristics, intraoperative transient neurological symptoms, hypotension, bradycardia, major adverse events (major stroke, myocardial infarction, and death within 90Â days), minor stroke, hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted images after carotid artery stenting, captured visible debris, and restenosis.
RESULTS: In this cohort, 5% of patients with internal carotid artery stenosis had contralateral carotid occlusion. No statistically significant differences in patient characteristics existed between the groups. The success rate of carotid artery stenting was 100%. There were no statistically significant differences in intraoperative complications, postoperative major adverse events, or other outcomes between both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort, carotid artery stenting using dual protection combined with blood aspiration was safe and effective in preventing distal embolism in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis and contralateral carotid occlusion.
