Title: Prognostic Value of Left Ventricular Global Longitudinal Strain for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Aortic Valve Disease: A Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Valvular heart disease is one of the most common heart diseases. It is characterized by abnormal function or structure of the heart valves. There may be no clinical symptoms in the early stages. Clinical symptoms of arrhythmia, heart failure, or thromboembolic events may occur in the late stages of the disease, such as palpitation after activities, breathing difficulties, fatigue, and so on. Aortic valve disease is a major part of valvular heart disease. The main treatment for aortic valve disease is valve replacement or repair surgery, but it is extremely risky. Therefore, a rigorous prognostic assessment is extremely important for patients with aortic valve disease. The global longitudinal strain is an index that describes the deformation capacity of myocardium. There is evidence that it provides a test for systolic dysfunction other than LVEF (left ventricular ejection fraction) and provides additional prognostic information.
METHOD: Search literature published between 2010 and 2023 on relevant platforms and contain the following keywords: "Aortic valve disease," "Aortic stenosis," "Aortic regurgitation," and "longitudinal strain" or "strain." The data is then extracted and collated for analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 15 articles were included. The total population involved in this study was 3,678 individuals. The absolute value of LVGLS was higher in the no-MACE group than in the MACE group in patients with aortic stenosis (Z = 8.10, p &lt; 0.00001), and impaired LVGLS was a risk factor for MACE in patients with aortic stenosis (HR = 1.14, p &lt; 0.00001, 95% CI: 1.08-1.20). There was also a correlation between impaired LVGLS and aortic valve surgery in patients with aortic valve disease (HR = 1.16, p &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI: 1.08-1.25) or patients with aortic valve regurgitation (HR = 1.21, p = 0.0004, 95% CI: 1.09-1.34). We also found that impaired LVGLS had no significant association between LVGLS and mortality during the period of follow-up in patients with aortic valve stenosis (HR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.94-1.25, p = 0.28), but it was associated with mortality in studies of prospective analyses (HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.02-1.75, p = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Impaired LVGLS correlates with major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with aortic valve disease, and it has predictive value for the prognosis of patients with aortic valve disease.
