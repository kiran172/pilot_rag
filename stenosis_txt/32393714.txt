Title: [Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery Following Anesthesia Induction under Percutaneous Cardiopulmonary Support for Prosthetic Valve Dysfunction and Severe Pulmonary Hypertension in a Patient with Previous Mitral Valve Replacement].

Abstract: A 47-year-old woman with a history of mitral valve replacement (MVR) through a median sternotomy was admitted to our hospital due to dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiography showed bioprosthetic valve dysfunction with mitral stenosis. Right heart catheter examination revealed severe pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction. We considered that she could not tolerate the hemodynamic changes during induction of general anesthesia without any cardiopulmonary support. Therefore, the percutaneous cardiopulmonary support was started before induction of anesthesia. To avoid the risk of injury to cardiac structures, we performed redo mitral valve replacement via right mini-horacotomy in the 4th intercostal space. Severe calcification was found in the leaflets of the prosthetic valve. She was discharged home on postoperative day 42.
