Title: Stent placement using the EUS-guided pancreatic duct drainage rendezvous technique for pancreatic ductal stenosis after endoscopic papillectomy.

Abstract: Pancreatic ductal stenosis after endoscopic papillectomy may be particularly troublesome because of the risk of acute pancreatitis if the stenosis cannot be released. Yamamoto and colleagues report a case of successful pancreatic stent placement using the endoscopic ultrasound guided pancreatic duct drainage rendezvous technique for pancreatic ductal stenosis after endoscopic papillectomy.
