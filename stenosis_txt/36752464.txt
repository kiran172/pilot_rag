Title: Heart Rate Variability Analysis May Identify Individuals With Williams-Beuren Syndrome at Risk of Sudden Death.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Williams-Beuren syndrome (WBS) (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man #194050) is a rare genetic multisystem disorder resulting from a chromosomal microdeletion at 7q11.23. The condition is characterized by distinct facies, intellectual disability, and supravalvar aortic stenosis. Those with WBS have an increased risk of sudden death, but mechanisms underlying this phenotype are incompletely understood.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to quantify and compare autonomic activity as reflected by heart rate variability (HRV) measures in a cohort of individuals with WBS (n = 18) and age- and sex-matched control subjects (n = 18).
METHODS: We performed HRV analysis on 24-hour electrocardiography recordings using nonlinear, time and frequency domain analyses on a cohort of subjects with WBS and age- and sex-matched control subjects enrolled in a prospective cross-sectional study designed to characterize WBS disease natural history.
RESULTS: WBS subjects demonstrated diminished HRV (reflected by the SD of the NN intervals [P = 0.0001], SD of the average NN interval for 5-minute intervals over 24 hours [P < 0.0001], average of the 5-minute SDs of NN intervals for 24 hours [P = 0.0002], root mean square of successive differences of NN intervals [P = 0.0004], short axis of the Poincaré plot (SD1) [P < 0.0001], and long axis of the Poincaré plot [P < 0.0001]) and indirect markers of parasympathetic activity (reflected by the percent of NN intervals different from previous by 50% or more of local average [P < 0.0007], root mean square of successive differences of NN intervals [P = 0.0004], natural log high-frequency power [P = 0.0038], and SD1 [P < 0.0001]). Additional parameters were also significantly different, including natural log very low-frequency power (decreased; P = 0.0002), natural log low-frequency power (decreased; P = 0.0024), and SD1 divided by the long axis of the Poincaré plot (decreased; P < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with WBS demonstrate significant HRV abnormalities consistent with diminished autonomic reserve. Future studies will be needed to determine the relationship between autonomic dysregulation observed and sudden death risk seen in these patients.
