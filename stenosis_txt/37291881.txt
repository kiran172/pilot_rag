Title: One Year Outcomes of Zilver PTX Versus Eluvia for Femoropopliteal Disease in Real-World Practice: REALDES Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This multicenter, prospective, observational study aimed to compare Zilver PTX and Eluvia stents in real-world settings for treating femoropopliteal lesions as the differences in the 1-year outcomes of these stents have not been elucidated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Overall, 200 limbs with native femoropopliteal artery disease were treated with Zilver PTX (96 limbs) or Eluvia (104 limbs) at 8 Japanese hospitals between February 2019 and September 2020. The primary outcome measure of this study was primary patency at 12 months, defined as a peak systolic velocity ratio of ≤2.4, without clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) or stenosis ≤50% based on angiographic findings.
RESULTS: The baseline clinical and lesion characteristics of Zilver PTX and Eluvia groups were roughly comparable (of all limbs analyzed, approximately 30% presented with critical limb-threatening ischemia, approximately 60% presented with Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus II C-D, and approximately half had total occlusion), except for the longer lesion lengths in the Zilver PTX group (185.7±92.0 mm vs 160.0±98.5 mm, p=0.030). The Kaplan-Meier estimates of primary patency at 12 months were 84.9% and 88.1% for Zilver PTX and Eluvia, respectively (log-rank p=0.417). Freedom from clinically-driven TLR rates were 88.8% and 90.9% for Zilver PTX and Eluvia, respectively (log-rank p=0.812).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the Zilver PTX and Eluvia stents were not different regarding primary patency and freedom from clinically-driven TLR at 12 months after treating patients with femoropopliteal peripheral artery disease in real-world settings.
CLINICAL IMPACT: This is the first study to reveal that the Zilver PTX and Eluvia have similar results in real-world practice when the proper vessel preparation is performed. However, the type of restenosis in the Eluvia stent may differ from that in the Zilver PTX stent. Therefore, the results of this study may influence the selection of DES for femoropopliteal lesions in routine clinical practice.
