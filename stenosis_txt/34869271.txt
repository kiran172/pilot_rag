Title: Vancomycin-Loaded Polycaprolactone Electrospinning Nanofibers Modulate the Airway Interfaces to Restrain Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Site-specific release of therapeutics at the infected trachea remains a great challenge in clinic. This work aimed to develop a series of vancomycin (VA)-loaded polycaprolactone (PCL) composite nanofiber films (PVNF-n, n = 0, 1, and 5, respectively) via the electrospinning technique. The physiochemical and biological properties of PVNF-n were evaluated by a series of tests, such as FT-IR, XRD, SEM-EDS, and antibacterial assay. The PVNF-n samples displayed a typical network structure of fibers with random directions. VA was successfully introduced into the PCL nanofibers and could be sustained and released. More importantly, PVNF-5 showed relatively good antibacterial activity against both methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPn). Thus, PVNF-5 was covered onto the self-expandable metallic stent and then implanted into a New Zealand rabbit model to repair tracheal stenosis. Compared to a metallic stent, a commercial pellosil matrix-covered stent, and a PVNF-0-covered metallic stent, the PVNF-5-covered airway stent showed reduced granulation tissue thickness, collagen density, α-SMA, CD68, TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6 expression. In conclusion, this work provides an anti-infection film-covered airway stent that in site restrains tracheal stenosis.
