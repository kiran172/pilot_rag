Title: Urgent aortic valve neocuspidization using the Ozaki procedure in an infant with native aortic valve endocarditis.

Abstract: Native valve aortic endocarditis is rarely seen in the paediatric population. Although, the first-line of treatment is medical, surgical intervention may be indicated in patients with unrepairable valvular and subvalvular disease. Recently, the aortic valve neocuspidization (AVNeo) procedure has gained popularity both in adult and children in whom other repair techniques are not feasible. In this case report, we present an urgent aortic valve replacement using the AVNeo technique in a critically ill infant with a small annulus, severe left ventricular outflow tract stenosis, and severe aortic regurgitation.
