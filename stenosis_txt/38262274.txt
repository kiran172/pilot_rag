Title: Dietary oily fish intake is inversely associated with moderate-to-severe intracranial artery stenosis in older adults of indigenous Ecuadorian ancestry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Information on the association between dietary oily fish intake and intracranial atherosclerosis is limited and contradictory. Inconsistencies might be in part related to heterogeneous designs and differences in race/ethnicity of study populations. We aim to assess whether oily fish intake is inversely associated with intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS) in frequent fish consumers of indigenous ancestry living in coastal Ecuador.
METHODS: The study included 384 participants aged ≥60 years enrolled in the Atahualpa Project Cohort. Dietary oily fish intake was quantified systematically via validated surveys and all participants received a time-of-flight MRA of intracranial vessels. Poisson regression models, adjusted for demographics, level of education, traditional risk factors and severe tooth loss, were fitted to assess the association between amounts of oily fish intake and the number of intracranial arteries with moderate-to-severe (≥50 %) stenosis.
RESULTS: Participants had a mean age of 67.7 ± 7 years, and 56 % were women. The mean oily fish intake was 8.9 ± 5.2 servings/week; 283 (74 %) participants consumed ≥5.2 servings/week (2nd to 4th quartiles of fish intake). Forty-three (11 %) participants had at least one major intracranial artery with moderate-to-severe stenosis. Both univariate and multivariate models showed a significant inverse association between consumption of oily fish in the 2nd to 4th quartiles and ≥50 % stenosis in at least one artery (β: 0.46; 95 % C.I.: 0.27-077, and β: 0.52; 95 % C.I.: 0.30-0.90, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of more than five oily fish servings/week is associated with lower prevalence of moderate-to-severe ICAS in indigenous Ecuadorians.
