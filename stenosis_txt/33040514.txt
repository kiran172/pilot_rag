Title: [Nasal manifestations of Sjogren's syndrome].

Abstract: We reported a case of a 43-year-old female patient with nasal Sjogren's syndrome（SS）. She complained of dry and tingling nose for 5 months. Physical examination: bilateral nasal stenosis, swelling of the mucosa at the front of the nasal septum, dry oral mucosa, and strawberry tongue. Sinus CT showed: bilateral nasal cavity stenosis, nasal septal mucosa and bilateral nasal mucosa hypertrophy. Salivary gland dynamic imaging: the maximum excretion percentage of the left salivary gland is 4.05%, and the maximum excretion percentage of the right salivary gland is 1.81%. Labial gland biopsy showed that the salivary gland lobular structure existed, and multiple lymphocyte foci（&gt;50/each foci） were seen in the focal interstitium, which was consistent with the labial gland performance of SS. Immunohistochemistry showed: CD3+, CD20+, AE1/AE3+, Ki-67+, IgG+. After symptomatic treatment, the patient's dry nose and tingling symptoms disappeared. The swelling of the nasal mucosa disappeared, and the bilateral nasal cavity was well ventilated. Follow-up for half a year, no symptoms of nasal manifestations about Sjogren's syndrome has occurred.
