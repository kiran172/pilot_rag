Title: Transcarotid Arterial Revascularization Adoption Should not Be Hindered by a Concern for a Long Learning Curve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcarotid arterial revascularization (TCAR) offers a novel technique for carotid artery stenting (CAS) that provides flow reversal in the carotid artery and avoids aortic arch manipulation, thus, potentially lowering ipsilateral and contralateral periprocedural stroke rates. As a new technology, adoption may be limited by concern for learning a new technique. This study seeks to examine the number of cases needed for a surgeon to reach technical proficiency.
METHODS: Retrospective analysis was performed using a prospectively collected database of all TCAR procedures performed in a tertiary health care system between 2016 and 2020. Patient demographics and anatomic characteristics were collected. Intraoperative variables and perioperative outcomes were examined. These variables were collated into groups for the first 4 procedures, procedures 5-8, and after 8. Independent Samples t test, 1-way ANOVA, and logarithmic regression were used to statistically analyze the data.
RESULTS: One-hundred and eighty-seven TCARs were performed by 14 surgeons. One hundred and twenty-two (65%) were male, 59 (32%) were older than 75 years, and 83 (44%) were symptomatic. The most common indications were high-lesions in 87 patients (47%) and recurrent stenosis after CEA in 37 patients (20%). Significant differences were found between the first and second groups of 4 cases when comparing mean operative time (71 vs. 58 min; P = 0.001) and flow reversal time (10.8 vs. 7.9 min; P= 0.004). similar significant differences were found between the first and third groups of 4 cases but not between the second and third groups. There was a reduction in contrast usage and fluoroscopy time after the first 4 cases, however, this did not reach statistical significance. There was no ipsilateral perioperative strokes. One patient had a contralateral stroke on postoperative day 2 due to intracranial atherosclerosis, and there was one perioperative mortality that occurred on postoperative day 3 after discharge.
CONCLUSIONS: Procedural and flow reversal times significantly shorten after 4 TCAR procedures are performed. Other metrics, such as fluoroscopy time and contrast usage, are also decreased. Complications, in general, are minimal. Proficiency in TCAR, as measured by these metrics, is met after performing only 4 procedures.
