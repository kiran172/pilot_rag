Title: Pre-treatment bronchoscopic evaluation in a case of relapsing polychondrits.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a chronic and recurrent inflammatory disease of the cartilage tissues in the body. The cause of RP is unknown, and since it is a rare disease with symptoms that affect multiple organs, diagnosis is often delayed.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 62-year-old woman with no smoking history visited our institution complaining of fever, cough, and dyspnoea. Chest CT showed a stenosis from the left main bronchus to the left lower lobe branch. Bronchoscopy visualised intense erythema and oedema at the left main bronchus, with airway narrowing. Biopsy of the ear revealed degenerative vitreous cartilage and fibrous connective tissue with a mild inflammatory cell infiltrate. She was subsequently diagnosed with RP and administered systemic corticosteroid therapy. Her symptoms improved rapidly, and post-treatment bronchoscopy revealed that although mild erythema of the airway epithelium remained, oedema markedly improved, and the airway stenosis was resolved.
CONCLUSIONS: We report a case where pre-treatment bronchoscopy was able to visually confirm RP at the acute stage. Since RP is difficult to diagnose, severe airway narrowing can occur prior to diagnosis. Therefore, to determine the stage of the disease, it is helpful to perform bronchoscopic observation before treatment. However, bronchoscopic observation before treatment should be performed by experienced bronchoscopists due to the risk of airway obstruction.
