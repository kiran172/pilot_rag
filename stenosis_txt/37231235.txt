Title: Impact of osteoporotic risk in women undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Low body weight and advanced age are reported to be among the best predictors of osteoporosis, and osteoporosis self-assessment tool (OST) values are calculated using a simple formula to identify postmenopausal women at increased risk of osteoporosis. In our recent study, we demonstrated an association between fractures and poor outcomes in postmenopausal women following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In this study, we aimed to investigate the osteoporotic risk in women with severe aortic stenosis and determined whether an OST could predict all-cause mortality following TAVR. The study population comprised 619 women who underwent TAVR. Compared to a quarter of patients with diagnosis of osteoporosis, 92.4% of participants were at high risk of osteoporosis based on OST criteria. When divided into tertiles based on OST values, patients in tertile 1 (lowest OST) displayed increased frailty, a higher incidence of multiple fractures, and greater Society of Thoracic Surgeons scores. Estimated all-cause mortality survival rates 3 years post-TAVR were 84.2 ± 3.0%, 89.5 ± 2.6%, and 96.9 ± 1.7% for OST tertiles 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that the OST tertile 3 was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality compared with OST tertile 1 as the referent. Notably, a history of osteoporosis was not associated with all-cause mortality. Patients with high osteoporotic risk are highly prevalent among those with aortic stenosis according to the OST criteria. OST value is a useful marker for predicting all-cause mortality in patients undergoing TAVR.
