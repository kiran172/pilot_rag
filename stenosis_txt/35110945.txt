Title: Therapeutic endoscopy for the treatment of post-bariatric surgery complications.

Abstract: Obesity rates continue to climb worldwide. Obesity often contributes to other comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, heart disease and is a known risk factor for many malignancies. Bariatric surgeries are by far the most invasive treatment options available but are often the most effective and can result in profound, durable weight loss with improvement in or resolution of weight associated comorbidities. Currently performed bariatric surgeries include Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, and laparoscopic gastric banding. These surgeries are associated with significant weight loss, but also with significant rates of major complications. The complexity of these patients and surgical anatomies makes management of these complications by a multidisciplinary team critical for optimal outcomes. Minimally invasive treatments for complications are typically preferred because of the high risk associated with repeat operations. Endoscopy plays a large role in both the diagnosis and the management of complications. Endoscopy can provide therapeutic interventions for many bariatric surgical complications including anastomotic strictures, anastomotic leaks, choledocholithiasis, sleeve stenosis, weight regain, and eroded bands. Endoscopists should be familiar with the various surgical anatomies as well as the various therapeutic options available. This review article serves to delineate the current role of endoscopy in the management of complications after bariatric surgery.
