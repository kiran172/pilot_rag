Title: Clinical and Angiographic Outcomes of Elective Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Angioplasty in Comparison with Drug-Eluting Stents for De Novo Coronary Lesions in Large Vessels.

Abstract: We retrospectively examined the feasibility of paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB) angioplasty for de novo stenosis in large coronary vessels (LV; pre- or postprocedural reference vessel diameter ≥ 2.75 mm) in comparison with placement of drug-eluting stents (DESs).Consecutive de novo stenotic lesions in the LV electively and successfully treated with either PCB (n = 73) or DESs (n = 81) from January 2016 to December 2018 at our center were included. The primary endpoint was the incidence of target lesion failure (TLF), including cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and target vessel revascularization. The impact of PCB on TLF was examined using Cox proportional hazards models by including 39 variables. The secondary endpoint, angiographic restenosis, defined as a follow-up percent diameter stenosis > 50, was examined in angiographic follow-up lesions after PCB angioplasty (n = 56) and DES placement (n = 53). This retrospective investigation was conducted in July 2022.The mean PCB size and length were 3.23 ± 0.42 and 18.4 ± 4.3 mm, respectively. The TLF frequency in the PCB group (6.8% during the mean observational interval of 1536 ± 538 days) was not significantly different from that in the DES group (14.6%, 1344 ± 606 days, P = 0.097). PCB was not a significant predictor of TLF in the univariate analysis (hazard ratio: 0.424; 95%CI: 0.15-1.21; P = 0.108). There was no angiographic restenosis after PCB angioplasty.The present observational single-center study showed that PCB for de novo stenosis in the LV had no significant adverse impact on TLF and had favorable angiographic outcomes.
