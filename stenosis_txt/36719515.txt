Title: Dysphagia After Esophageal Replacement and Its Treatment.

Abstract: Dysphagia occurs temporarily or permanently following esophageal replacement in at least half of the cases. Swallowing disorder, in addition to severe decline in the quality of life, can lead to a deterioration of the general condition, which may lead to death if left untreated. For this reason, their early detection and treatment are a matter of importance. Between 1993 and 2012, 540 esophageal resections were performed due to malignant tumors at the Department of Surgery, Medical Center of the University of Pécs. Stomach was used for replacement in 445 cases, colon in 38 cases, and jejunum in 57 cases. The anastomosis with a stomach replacement was located to the neck in 275 cases and to the thorax in 170 cases. The colon was pulled up to the neck in each case. There were 29 cases of free jejunal replacements located to the neck and 28 cases with a Roux loop reconstruction located to the thorax. Based on the literature data and own experience, the following were found to be the causes of dysphagia in the order of frequency: anastomotic stenosis, conduit obstruction, peptic and ischemic stricture, foreign body, local recurrence, functional causes, new malignant tumor in the esophageal remnant, and malignant tumor in the organ used for replacement. Causes may overlap each other, and their treatment may be conservative or surgical. The causes of many dysphagic complications might be prevented by improving the anastomosis technique, by better preservation the blood supply of the substitute organ, by consistently applying a functional approach, and by regular follow-up.
