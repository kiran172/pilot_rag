Title: Aortic Valve Leaflet Rupture Causing Delayed Left Main Coronary Ostial Obstruction During Valvuloplasty Preceding TAVR.

Abstract: A 69-year-old man with mediastinal radiation history underwent balloon valvuloplasty before transcatheter aortic valveÂ replacement, which caused aortic leaflet rupture leading to unstable severe aortic regurgitation and subsequent left main ostial obstruction. A balloon-expanding valve was implanted to capture the ruptured leaflet and a left main stent was placed. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
