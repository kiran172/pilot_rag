Title: A Case of Vanishing Bronchus Syndrome in a Non-lung Transplant Patient.

Abstract: Vanishing bronchus syndrome (VBS) is the most severe form of bronchial stenosis. It has been described as a complication following a lung transplant (LT). We present a case of VBS in a patient with non-Hodgkin lymphoma in remission status post chemotherapy and radiation therapy and no history of a lung transplant.
