Title: Long-term outcomes after conservative and EDAS treatment for 111 elderly patients with moyamoya disease: longitudinal and cross-sectional study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the clinical features of moyamoya disease (MMD) and the efficacy of encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis (EDAS) in elderly patients with MMD and to identify the risk factors for long-term stroke events.
METHODS: Clinical data were retrospectively collected on elderly patients with MMD (age ≥ 60 years) who had been treated at the authors' center from May 2007 to December 2017. Clinical features, angiographic findings, and long-term outcomes (> 5-year follow-up) were analyzed. Cox regression analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for postoperative stroke events. Long-term stroke events were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves.
RESULTS: The mean age at symptom onset was 62.9 ± 3.0 years among 111 elderly patients with MMD. Vascular comorbidities were present in 80 (72.1%) patients. The ratio of female to male patients was 1:1.2. Familial MMD was found in 7 (6.3%) patients. Cerebral ischemia was the most common clinical manifestation observed in 82 (73.9%) patients. Most patients (59.5%) presented with Suzuki stages 5 and 6 MMD, and 29 (26.1%) patients presented with stenosis or occlusion of the posterior circulation. Unilateral MMD was present in 17 (15.3%) patients. Among the 58 (52.3%) patients who underwent EDAS, 28 (48.3%) and 30 (51.7%) underwent bilateral and unilateral surgeries, respectively. Overall, 53 (47.7%) patients were treated conservatively using internal medicine. After a median follow-up duration of 8.2 years, stroke incidence in the EDAS and conservative treatment groups was respectively 17.2% (7 and 3 cases of cerebral infarction and hemorrhage, respectively) and 49.1% (22 and 4 cases of cerebral infarction and hemorrhage, respectively). The stroke incidence rate was higher in the conservative group than in the EDAS group, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) according to results of the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The identified predictor of postoperative stroke events was initial hemorrhage in the EDAS group and advanced age, aneurysm, and initial ischemia in the conservative treatment group.
CONCLUSIONS: The postoperative long-term stroke rate among elderly patients with MMD was lower in the EDAS group than in the conservative treatment group. Long-term stroke events were associated with advanced age, aneurysm, and initial ischemia after conservative treatment and only initial hemorrhage after EDAS.
