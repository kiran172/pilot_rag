Title: Concentric ballooned catheterization to the fractional non-newtonian hybrid nano blood flow through a stenosed aneurysmal artery with heat transfer.

Abstract: The current work analyzes the effects of concentric ballooned catheterization and heat transfer on the hybrid nano blood flow through diseased arterial segment having both stenosis and aneurysm along its boundary. A fractional second-grade fluid model is considered which describes the non-Newtonian characteristics of the blood. Governing equations are linearized under mild stenosis and mild aneurysm assumptions. Precise articulations for various important flow characteristics such as heat transfer, hemodynamic velocity, wall shear stress, and resistance impedance are attained. Graphical portrayals for the impact of the significant parameters on the flow attributes have been devised. The streamlines of blood flow have been examined as well. The present finding is useful for drug conveyance system and biomedicines.
