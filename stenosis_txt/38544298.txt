Title: Technical considerations and sizing of external annuloplasty in the Ross procedure.

Abstract: Pure aortic regurgitation and dilation of aortic annulus are the most significant risk factors for the failure of pulmonary autograft after the Ross procedure. Aortic annuloplasty has a positive effect on the durability of the autograft. Previously, we described a technique for external annuloplasty with dedicated CORONEO ring. In the present manuscript, we suggest the sizing of annuloplasty based on the diameter of pulmonary autograft annulus.
