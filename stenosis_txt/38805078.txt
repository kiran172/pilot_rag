Title: Identification of peroneal artery perforators using non-contrast-enhanced T2prep multi-shot gradient echo planar imaging MRA.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the spatial resolution of non-contrast-enhanced (CE) T2prep multi-shot gradient echo planar imaging (MSG-EPI) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) required to identify peroneal artery perforators and demonstrate its effectiveness in preoperative simulation. Twenty-six legs of 13 volunteers were scanned using non-CE T2prep MSG-EPI-MRA at three spatial resolutions: 1.0-, 0.8-, and 0.6-mm isotropic voxels. The location and number of peroneal artery perforators that could be candidates for free fibula flaps were identified by consensus among three plastic surgeons. Surgeons distinguished between septocutaneous and musculocutaneous perforators using MRA, and confirmed the accuracy of their presence and identification using ultrasonography (US). The ability to detect hypoplasia or stenosis of the anterior tibial, posterior tibial, and peroneal arteries was evaluated by confirming the consistency between the MRA and US results. The number of cutaneous perforators identified using MRA and confirmed using US was 39, 51, and 52 at each respective resolution. The discrimination accuracies between septocutaneous and musculocutaneous perforators were 92.3%, 96.1%, and 96.2%. The number of identified septocutaneous perforators was 1.3 ± 0.6, 1.6 ± 0.8, and 1.7 ± 0.8 at 1.0-, 0.8-, and 0.6-mm data, respectively. All the MRA results, including hypoplasia and stenosis, were consistent with the US results. Non-CE T2prep MSG-EPI-MRA with a spatial resolution of 0.8 mm or less shows promise for identifying septocutaneous perforators of the peroneal artery, suggesting its potential as an alternative to conventional imaging methods for the preoperative planning of free fibula osteocutaneous flap transfers.
