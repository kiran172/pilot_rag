Title: Speckle-Tracking Echocardiography Predicts Adverse Left Ventricular Remodeling After Valve Replacement in Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rheumatic mitral stenosis(RMS) may leads to left ventricular remodeling (LVR), which can persist even after valve surgery. Identifying markers for early structure and function in patients with rheumatic heart disease who are at risk for adverse LVR after surgery can help determine the optimal timing of intervention. This study aimed to investigate whether preoperative parameters of global left ventricular long-axis strain (LVGLS) and mechanical discretization (MD) could predict postoperative adverse LVR.
METHODS: A total of 109 adult patients withÂ RMS and 50 healthy controls were enrolled in this study. Baseline clinical features, conventional echocardiography results, LVGLS, and MD were compared between the two groups. Pre- and post-surgery echocardiography measurements were collected, and adverse LVR was defined as a>15% increase in left ventricular end-diastolic volume or >10% decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction. Binary regression analysis was used to determine independent predictors of poor left ventricular remodeling.
RESULTS: The variables associated with adverse LVR in this study were LVGLS (P<0.001, odds ratio: 1.996, 95% CI: 1.394-2.856) and MD (P=0.011, odds ratio: 1.031, 95% CI: 1.007-1.055). The poorly reconstructed group had lower absolute values of LVGLS and higher MD than the healthy control group and the non-poorly reconstructed group. A LVGLS cutoff of -15.0% was the best predictor for patients with poorly reconstructed LVR (sensitivity: 75.7%; specificity: 100.0%; AUC: 0.93), and a MD cutoff of 63.8ms was the best predictor (sensitivity: 63.8%; specificity: 98.6%; AUC: 0.88).
CONCLUSION: Speckle tracking echocardiography has potential value for predicting the progression of adverse LVR and for identifying non-responders among patients with RMS undergoing surgery.
