Title: High-density lipoprotein lipid peroxidation as a diagnostics biomarker in coronary artery disease.

Abstract: This study aimed at evaluating the serum High-density lipoprotein lipid peroxidation (HDLox) levels and their association with coronary artery disease (CAD). This case-control study comprised 572 patients with stable CAD and 281 healthy subjects with no history of cardiovascular disease (control group). Based on the results of coronary angiography, the patient group was divided into two groups: CAD- and CAD+. HDLox was measured using a fluorimetric method. The ability of HDLox and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to detect CAD and coronary artery stenosis ≥50% was also compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The CAD patients showed significantly higher serum HDLox levels, compared to the control group [1.15 (1.01-1.31) vs. 0.85 (0.62-1.06), no units, p < 0.001]. Moreover, serum HDLox levels were significantly lower in CAD- patients, compared to the CAD+ patients [1.05 (0.92-1.22) vs. 1.24 (1.12-1.35), no units, p < 0.001]. According to the results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression, the HDLox showed association with the presence of CAD (odds ratio [OR]: 1.754; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.564-1.968; p < 0.001) and coronary artery stenosis ≥50% (OR: 1.729; 95% CI: 1.534-1.949; p < 0.001). The results obtained from the area under the ROC curve revealed that the HDLox could better detect the risk of CAD and coronary artery stenosis ≥50% compared to serum HDL-C level. The oxidation of HDL leads to a reduction in its antioxidant function and it has a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis. HDLox is suggested as a diagnostics biomarker for CAD.
