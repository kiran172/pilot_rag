Title: [Mid- and long-term outcomes of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty guided solely by echocardiography].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the mid-and long-term clinical outcomes of percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) guided solely by echocardiography. Methods: A total of 71 patients with moderate to severe mitral stenosis who underwent PBMV guided solely by echocardiography at Fuwai Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, from January 2016 to December 2022 were retrospectively included. The clinical data and follow-up information were collected and analyzed. Results: Finally, 71 patients (11 males and 60 females) aged (48.6±12.4) years, including 3 pregnant women were included. One patient required surgical intervention due to moderate to severe mitral regurgitation, resulting in a procedure success rate of 98.6% (70/71). The procedural duration was (84.1±40.2) minutes, with the balloon diameter of (26.5±1.1) mm and number of dilatations of 2.9±0.7. The mean mitral transvalvular pressure gradient decreased from (12.6±6.1) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) preoperatively to (5.4±2.4) mmHg postoperatively, while the mitral valve orifice area increased from (0.9±0.2) cm² to (1.7±0.3) cm² (both P&lt;0.001). Before discharge, 16 patients developed new mild mitral regurgitation, five developed new moderate mitral regurgitation, and one patient had a small amount of pericardial effusion absorbed by herself. No severe complications such as death, pericardial tamponade, or thromboembolism occurred during the perioperative period. The average follow-up duration was 12-84 (49.7±21.4) months. At two years postoperatively, the mean mitral transvalvular pressure gradient was (6.2±2.5) mmHg, and the mitral valve orifice area was (1.6±0.3) cm². Eight patients underwent surgical mitral valve replacement at an median of [M(Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>)] 18 (5, 53) months postoperatively, and one patient died during the follow-up period due to non-cardiac reasons. Conclusion: The mid-and long-term outcomes of PBMV guided solely by echocardiography are favorable.
