Title: Evaluating the Efficacy of Water-Soluble Bone Wax (Tableau Wax) in Reducing Blood Loss in Spinal Fusion Surgery: A Randomized, Controlled, Pilot Study.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Lumbar decompression with fusion surgery is an effective treatment for spinal stenosis, but critical postoperative hematoma is a concern. Bone wax has been widely used to control bone bleeding but it has some drawbacks. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of Tableau wax, a bioabsorbable hemostatic material, in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery through a pilot study design. Materials and Methods: A total of 31 patients were enrolled in this single-surgeon, single-institution study. The participants underwent transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion surgery and were randomly assigned to the control group (Bone wax) or test group (Tableau wax). Demographic data, pre- and post-operative hemoglobin levels, blood loss volume, surgical time, Oswestry Disability Index, and EQ-5D scores were recorded. Results: The study showed no significant difference in preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels, Oswestry Disability Index, and EQ-5D scores between the groups. However, the Tableau wax group had a significantly lower reduction in hemoglobin levels (1.3 ± 1.0 g/dL) and blood loss (438.2 mL) compared to the Bone wax group (2.2 ± 0.9 g/dL and 663.1 mL, respectively; p = 0.018 and p = 0.022).
