Title: Predictive role of monocyte count for significant coronary artery disease identification in patients with stable coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The coronary artery disease (CAD) remains the leading cause of morbidity that is characterized by broad spectrum of symptoms. Up to 30% of performed angiographies reveal normal coronary arteries. The aim of the study was to find simple predictor for significant epicardial artery stenosis among patients with chronic coronary syndrome.
METHODS: There were 187 patients (131 (709%) men and 56 (30%) women) in the median (Q1-Q3) age of 67 [58-72] presenting with stable CAD symptoms enrolled into the present retrospective analysis. The demographical, clinical and laboratory characteristics between patients with normal and significant coronary artery stenosis were compared.
RESULTS: The multivariable analysis revealed coexistence of hypercholesterolemia as significant differentiation factor (odds ratio [OR]: 4.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.78-10.80, p = 0.001) for significant CAD and inverse relation to serum high density lipoprotein (OR: 0.19, 95% CI: 0.05-0.72, p = 0.015) and relation to creatinine concentration (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.05, p = 0.012). Among whole peripheral blood count analysis, the significant relation was noticed to be hemoglobin concentration (OR: 1.09, 95% CI: 1.10-1.18, p = 0.022) and monocyte count (OR: 32.3, 95% CI: 1.09-653.6, p = 0.017). Receiver operator curve revealed (AUC: 0.641, p = 0.001) with the optimal cut-off value above 0.45 K/uL for monocyte, yelding sensitivity of 81.82% and specificity of 58.06%.
CONCLUSIONS: The peripheral monocyte count above 0.45 k/uL may be considered as a predictor of significant coronary artery disease in symptomatic patients with chronic coronary syndrome.
