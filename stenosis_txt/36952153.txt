Title: Functional epiphora: an under-reported entity.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the etiology of epiphora in a tertiary Australian lacrimal clinic and highlight the high proportion of 'functional' cases.
METHODS: Single-center retrospective review: Records of adult patients presenting to a tertiary lacrimal clinic from January 2011 to February 2021 with epiphora were reviewed. Patients underwent testing with syringing/probing and lacrimal imaging to reach a diagnosis of functional epiphora. Functional epiphora was diagnosed based on the exclusion of alternate causes of epiphora on clinical examination, patent lacrimal syringing, normal dacryocystography, and delay on dacryoscintigraphy.
RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-six symptomatic eyes of 372 adult patients (mean 66.2 ± 15.5 years, 63.4% females) with epiphora were evaluated for causes. Post-sac obstruction (stenosis/complete obstruction) and functional epiphora (non-anatomical delay) were the most common causes of presentations to the lacrimal clinic (26% each). Functional epiphora with post-sac delay was substantially more common than functional epiphora with pre-sac delay (89% vs. 11% of functional epiphora cases). In 16% of the cases, no cause for the epiphora was found while more than one cause (multifactorial) was present 11% of the time.
CONCLUSION: Functional epiphora was found to be as common as a nasolacrimal anatomical obstruction when lacrimal imaging is utilized.
