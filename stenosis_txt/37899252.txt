Title: Impact of the Barthel Index Score and Prognosis on Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few studies have compared the Barthel Index (BI) score and postoperative outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). We aimed to examine the relationship between the BI score and postoperative outcomes in patients who underwent TAVR and SAVR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included patients who underwent SAVR between January 2014 and December 2022 (n=293) and patients who underwent TAVR between January 2016 and December 2022 (n=312). We examined the risk factors for long-term mortality in the 2 groups. The mean (±SD) preoperative BI score was 88.7±18.0 in the TAVR group and 95.8±12.3 in the SAVR group. The home discharge rate was significantly lower in the SAVR than TAVR group. The BI score at discharge was significantly higher in the SAVR than in TAVR group (86.2 vs. 80.2; P<0.001). Significant risk factors for long-term mortality in the TAVR group were sex (P<0.001) and preoperative hemoglobin level (P=0.008), whereas those in the SAVR group were preoperative albumin level (P=0.04) and postoperative BI score (P=0.02). The cut-off point of the postoperative BI score determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was 60.0.
CONCLUSIONS: The BI score at discharge was a significant risk factor for long-term mortality in the SAVR group, with a cut-off value of 60.0.
