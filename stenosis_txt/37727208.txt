Title: Transarterial infusion chemotherapy for advanced esophageal cancer with airway stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of transarterial infusion chemotherapy for the treatment of esophageal cancer with airway stenosis.
METHODS: Data of patients with advanced esophageal cancer complicated with airway stenosis treated with transarterial infusion chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Dyspnea, clinical efficacy and adverse reactions were evaluated.
RESULTS: Of these patients, 27 had grade II preoperative dyspnea, and 31 had grade III preoperative dyspnea, 26 had grade I postoperative dyspnea, 25 had grade II postoperative dyspnea, and 7 had grade III postoperative dyspnea. Among 3 patients with left main bronchial stenosis and atelectasis, 2 had complete remission after transarterial infusion chemotherapy, and 1 demonstrated partial remission. After treatment, complete response, partial response, and stable disease were observed in 7, 34, and 17 cases, respectively. Total objective effective rate and disease control rate were 70.6% (41/58) and 100.0%, respectively. During follow up, 24 patients died of organ failure, and 17 patients died of tumor-related respiratory failure. Seven patients died of gastrointestinal bleeding, 1 patient died of myocardial infarction, and 9 patients survived.
CONCLUSIONS: Transarterial infusion chemotherapy is safe and effective for the treatment of advanced esophageal cancer with airway stenosis.
