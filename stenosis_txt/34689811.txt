Title: Free-breathing high resolution modified Dixon steady-state angiography with compressed sensing for the assessment of the thoracic vasculature in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography (CMRA) is a non-invasive imaging modality of choice in pediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). This study was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic utility of a respiratory- and electrocardiogram-gated steady-state CMRA with modified Dixon (mDixon) fat suppression technique and compressed sensing in comparison to standard first-pass CMRA in pediatric patients with CHD at 3 T.
METHODS: In this retrospective single center study, pediatric CHD patients who underwent CMR with first-pass CMRA followed by mDixon steady-state CMRA at 3 T were analyzed. Image quality using a Likert scale from 5 (excellent) to 1 (non-diagnostic) and quality of fat suppression were assessed in consensus by two readers. Blood-to-tissue contrast and quantitative measurements of the thoracic vasculature were assessed separately by two readers. CMRA images were reevaluated by two readers for additional findings, which could be identified only on either one of the CMRA types. Paired Student t test, Wilcoxon test, and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used for statistical analysis.
RESULTS: 32 patients with CHD (3.3 ± 1.7 years, 13 female) were included. Overall image quality of steady-state mDixon CMRA was higher compared to first-pass CMRA (4.5 ± 0.5 vs. 3.3 ± 0.5; P < 0.001). Blood-to-tissue contrast ratio of steady-state mDixon CMRA was comparable to first-pass CMRA (7.85 ± 4.75 vs. 6.35 ± 2.23; P = 0.133). Fat suppression of steady-state mDixon CMRA was perfect in 30/32 (94%) cases. Vessel diameters were greater in first-pass CMRA compared to steady-state mDixon CMRA with the greatest differences at the level of pulmonary arteries and veins (e.g., right pulmonary artery for reader 1: 10.4 ± 2.4 vs. 9.9 ± 2.3 mm, P < 0.001). Interobserver agreement was higher for steady-state mDixon CMRA for all measurements compared to first-pass CMRA (ICCs > 0.92). In 9/32 (28%) patients, 10 additional findings were identified on mDixon steady-state CMRA (e.g., partial anomalous venous return, abnormalities of coronary arteries, subclavian artery stenosis), which were not depicted using first-pass CMRA.
CONCLUSIONS: Steady-state mDixon CMRA offers a robust fat suppression, a high image quality, and diagnostic utility for the assessment of the thoracic vasculature in pediatric CHD patients.
