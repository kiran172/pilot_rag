Title: Pulmonary apoplexy following severe mitral valve stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Hemoptysis is a common clinical symptom in emergency patients. It is characterized by the discharge of bloody sputum, which originates from the lower respiratory tract. In the majority of cases, this event is self-limiting, and only in less than 5% of cases, it is massive. Mitral valve stenosis is an uncommon cause of hemoptysis, with a prevalence of 4.2%. In rare cases of this condition, massive and sudden hemoptysis occurs, which is called pulmonary apoplexy. Here, a 35-year-old woman with a history of mitral valve stenosis is introduced who was referred to the hospital with a complaint of massive hemoptysis and sudden shortness of breath. According to the history of mitral valve stenosis, the patient was diagnosed with pulmonary apoplexy. After treatment, both the imaging findings and the patient's symptoms resolved within a short period of time. Even though pulmonary apoplexy is often severe, it can still respond well to conservative treatments and may indicate a need for immediate attention to the stenosis of the mitral valve.
