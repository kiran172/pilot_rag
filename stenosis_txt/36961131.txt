Title: Long-term follow up of surgical management of blood blister-like aneurysms at non-branching sites of the internal carotid artery.

Abstract: To describe long-term follow-up of 25 patients who presented with subarachnoid hemorrhages due to blood blister-like aneurysms (BBAs) treated with direct clipping or clip reinforcement with or without direct neck repair. Between June 1993 and July 2009, 25 consecutive patients with ruptured BBAs of the supraclinoid internal carotid artery were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age of patients was 39.5 ± 11.3 years. The mean duration of clinical follow-up was 128.9 months (range, 85-196 months). All aneurysms were located in the supraclinoid portion of the internal carotid artery. The mean aneurysm diameter was 4.04 ± 1.3 mm on intra-operative microscopic field. Tearing of the aneurysmal neck during dissection occurred in 8 (32%) patients. Six of 7 patients with neck tearing underwent direct neck repair. Surgeons treated aneurysms via direct clipping with a Bemsheet® in 5 (20%) patients or by clip reinforcement with a silicone sheet in 20 (80%) patients. Clinical outcomes were favorable (modified Rankin Scale [mRS]: 0-2) in 21 (84%) of 25 patients. Four (16%) patients had an unfavorable outcome (mRS: 3-6). The patient with severe disability (mRS: 4) was treated with clip reinforcement and direct neck repair. Mild stenosis, moderate stenosis, and total occlusion of the parent artery were confirmed in 10 (40%) patients, 6 (24%) patients, and 1 (4%) patient, respectively. Although surgical treatment of BBAs was associated with varying degrees of parent vessel patency loss, long-term follow-up results for more than 10 years showed that direct surgical clipping or clip reinforcement with a silicone sheet appeared to be a curative surgery.
