Title: Long-term outcome in patients treated with first- versus second-generation drug-eluting stents for the treatment of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE AND BACKGROUND: The study aim is to provide long-term clinical outcome after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for unprotected left main coronary arteries (ULMCA) stenosis with the first-generation (1st -gen) drug-eluting stents (DES) in comparison to 2nd -gen DES, since this is largely unknown.
METHODS: Between May 2002, and December 2014, a consecutive series of 656 all-comer patients underwent a PCI for ULMCA stenosis at the Erasmus Medical Center. A total of 235 patients were treated with 1st -gen DES, while a total of 421 patients were treated with 2nd -gen DES.
RESULTS: Overall, the population consisted of 73% males and 58% presented with an acute coronary syndrome. Median follow-up time was 1,361â€‰days (range from 0 to 5,031). At 5 years, the cumulative incidence of major adverse clinical events (the primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, any myocardial infarction or target lesion revascularization; MACE) did not differ between 1st - and 2nd -gen DES (36.8 vs. 38.6%, respectively, Log Rank p = .79, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.94-1.74]). No difference was found in the individual endpoints of all-cause mortality (29.5 vs. 29% respectively, p = .88, adjusted HR = 1.19 [95% CI, 0.84-1.68]), target vessel myocardial infarction (5.0 vs. 8.4%, p = 0.17, adjusted HR = 1.75 [95% CI, 0.78-3.96]) and target lesion revascularization (8.1 vs. 9.8%, p = .94, adjusted HR = 1.16 [95% CI, 0.59-2.29]) between the 1st - and 2nd -gen DES cohorts, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of consecutive patients treated for ULMCA stenosis, no significant differences were found in the safety and efficacy of 1st versus 2nd -gen DES at 5 years follow-up.
