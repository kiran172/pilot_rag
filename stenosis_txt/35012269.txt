Title: [Advancement in endovascular therapy of aortoiliac occlusive disease].

Abstract: Aortoiliac occlusive disease (AIOD) refers to the stenosis and occlusion of the distal abdominal aorta and(or) bifurcation of the aortoiliac artery,which is mainly caused by atherosclerosis,leading to pelvic and lower limb ischemia.Open surgery has always been the main treatment for complex AIOD.However,in recent years,with the development of endovascular surgery technologies and medical instruments,its treatment concept has been greatly changed.More and more clinical evidence has proved that the long-term efficacy of endovascular therapy is not inferior to that of traditional open surgery,so minimally invasive endovascular therapy has become the preferred treatment for AIOD.
