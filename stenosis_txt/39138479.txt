Title: Unusual and very rare presentation of wrist pain in a man with acute anterior myocardial infarction, a case report and literature of review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: As acute myocardial infarction (AMI) prevalence is increasing because of lifestyle changes, the incidence of atypical symptoms in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is rising and making misdiagnosing of this fatal event more probable. To better approach the patients with atypical symptoms, we tend to present a rare case of AMI with wrist pain.
CASE REPORT: A 41-year-old man presented to the emergency room (ER) with severe both-hand wrist pain and mild epigastric pain. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (MI) with an ejection fraction of 35-40%. His angiography showed severe left anterior descending artery (LAD), and first obtuse marginal artery (OM1) artery stenosis. He underwent Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The patient recovered without serious complications and was discharged the day after PCI.
DISCUSSION: In this rare case of AMI with wrist pain, it is important to know that atypical symptoms can be present at various levels of symptoms, which prevents future misdiagnosis.
