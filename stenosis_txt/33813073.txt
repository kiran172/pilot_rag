Title: Defining the Long-Term Clinical Course and Need for Repeat Dilation for Patients With Schatzki Rings.

Abstract: Schatzki rings (SRs) are a well-known cause of intermittent solid-food dysphagia.1 Although some patients sustain improvement after 1 endoscopic dilation, others require repeated dilations for recurrent symptoms.2-4 SRs are believed to be distinct from strictures caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease. SRs are sharply localized lesions with clearly defined margins, whereas peptic strictures have a more gradual transition between normal and abnormal esophagus to produce a funnel-shaped narrowing.5,6 Consequently, it has been assumed that repeat dilation is less common in SRs dissimilar from medically untreated peptic strictures. The study aim was to identify clinical and radiologic predictors for repeated esophageal dilations in patients with SRs and to assess if peptic stricture-like characteristics of rings correspond to need for repeat dilation.
