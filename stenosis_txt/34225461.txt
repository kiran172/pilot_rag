Title: Neonatal right mini thoracotomy for repair of critical pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: Over the last few decades, due to evolving surgical techniques and medical management, there has been a significant decrease in the rate of mortality and complications for neonates born with critical pulmonary valve stenosis. Median sternotomy is the standard approach; however, this longitudinal midline incision is invasive and leaves a significant scar. A right mini thoracotomy approach to this surgical repair decreases recovery time and the chance of possible future psychological distress from a visible median sternotomy scar. This is the first article to describe a right mini thoracotomy approach for critical pulmonary stenosis during the neonatal period.
