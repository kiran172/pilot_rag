Title: Efficacy and Prediction Model Construction of Drug-Coated Balloon Combined with Cutting Balloon Angioplasty in the Treatment of Drug-Eluting Stent In-Stent Restenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of drug-coated balloon (DCB) combined with cutting balloon angioplasty (CBA) in the treatment of drug-eluting stent in-stent restenosis (DES-ISR) and to construct a predictive model for the occurrence of DES-ISR.
METHODS: According to the criteria of diagnosis, inclusion, and exclusion, DES-ISR patients who were treated in the outpatient and inpatient departments of cardiovascular medicine of Second People's Hospital of Guangdong Province from July 2021 to December 2021 were included. A total of 72 cases were planned to be enrolled, including 36 cases in the control group and 36 cases in the experimental group. The control group was treated with DCB, and the experimental group was combined with CBA. The treatment success rate, coronary angiography results before and after surgery, and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events during the follow-up period were compared between the two groups. Seventy-two DES-ISR patients were divided into ISR group and 59 non-ISR patients were divided into non-ISR group. The clinical data of the two groups were compared to analyze the risk factors affecting the occurrence of DES-ISR, and the prediction model was established.
RESULTS: The surgical success rate of the experimental group was 94.44% (34/36), which was higher than the 77.78% (28/36) of the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The minimum lumen diameter (MLD) of the experimental group 6 months after operation was greater than that of the control group, the late lumen loss (LL) and lumen stenosis rate were higher than those in the control group, and the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events was lower than that in the control group (P &lt; 0.05). In the ISR group, the proportion of patients with abnormal BMI, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and family history of coronary heart disease and multivessel coronary artery disease was higher than that in the non-ISR group, the degree of stenosis target lesion was higher than that in the non-ISR group, the diameter of target lesion and stent diameter were smaller than those in the non-ISR group, and the length of target lesion and stent length were longer than those in the non-ISR group; the number of stents was more than that in the non-ISR group (P &lt; 0.05). Combined hypertension, multiple coronary artery lesions, stenosis target lesion degree ≥85.05%, and target lesion length ≥36.88 mm were risk factors for DES-ISR, and target lesion diameter ≥3.15 mm and stent diameter ≥3.15 mm were protective factors (P &lt; 0.05). The prediction model of DES-ISR was obtained by multiple logistic regression analysis, P = 1[1 + e (2.281 + 3.321X<sub>hypertension</sub> + 3.427X<sub>umber of arterial lesions</sub> + 3.359X<sub>stenosis target lesion degree</sub> - 3.143X<sub>target lesion diameter</sub> + 0.650X<sub>target lesion length</sub> - 10.159X<sub>stent diameter</sub>)]. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test showed that Hosmer-Lemeshow χ 2 = 0.925, P =0.413; the ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC of the prediction model for the occurrence of DES-ISR was 0.924, the SE value was 0.022, and the 95% CI was 0.880-0.967.
CONCLUSION: DCB combined with CBA has good clinical efficacy in the treatment of DES-ISR, which can reduce the rate of lumen stenosis and the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. The prediction model established according to risk factors has high predictive value for the occurrence of DES-ISR.
