Title: [PENILE STRANGULATION CAUSED BY A METALLIC RING SUCCESSFULLY TREATED BY PENILE PUNCTURE PLUS BLOOD REMOVAL INSTEAD OF DESTROYING THE RING].

Abstract: A 63-year-old man visited our hospital with a complaint of penile swelling caused by metallic ring entrapment in the penis. He had put the ring around his penis 4 hours prior and was subsequently unable to remove it. We attempted to remove the ring using a ring cutter but that was unsuccessful. We then inserted two 18 G needles into the corpus cavernosum through the glans penis and removed blood by manual compression according to a technique called the "string method." The swelling gradually decreased, and we successfully removed the ring without destroying it. The total duration of strangulation was about 5 hours. The patient was subsequently discharged after ensuring he had no urinary difficulties. No complications were observed during the follow-up period.In almost all penile strangulation cases caused by hard objects, such as metallic rings, reported in Japan, the objects were typically destroyed and penile puncture and blood removal, as was performed in our case, was rare. Although penile puncture and blood removal is not commonly performed in Japan, this technique can be performed quickly and inexpensively in the emergency room and should be considered an initial treatment for penile strangulation caused by hard objects.
