Title: An improved guideline adherence and PPI efficacy has been accompanied by a decrease in diagnostic delay, and strictures before diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis in the North Denmark Region - a retrospective registry study of the DanEoE cohorts.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the North Denmark Region an increased awareness of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) was observed after 2011 where a regional biopsy guideline was implemented. This resulted in an increased awareness of EoE and a 50-fold increase in the incidence of EoE patients between 2007-2017.
AIMS: The aims of this study were to examine the progress in diagnostic delay, complications, PPI treatment, and follow up since 2017 in Danish patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective registry- and population-based cohort study (DanEoE2 cohort) including 346 adult patients with esophageal eosinophilia diagnosed between 2018-2021 in the North Denmark Region. The DanEoE2 cohort included all possible EoE patients by using the Danish Patho-histology registry based on the SNOMED-system. The data was analyzed and compared to the DanEoE cohort (2007-2017).
RESULTS: The diagnostic delay of EoE patients diagnosed between 2018-2021 in the North Denmark Region had decreased with a median of 1.5 years (5.5 (2.0;12) years versus 4.0 (1.0;12) years, p=0.03). Strictures before diagnosis had decreased 8.4 % (11.6% versus 3.2%, p=0.003). The number of patients started on high-dose PPI increased (56% versus 88%, p<0.001). An intensified awareness regarding national guidelines and follow-up was observed as an increase in the number of histological follow up (67% versus 74%, p=0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons of the DanEoE cohorts showed a decrease in diagnostic delay, a decrease in stricture formation before diagnosis, and an improved guideline adherence after 2017. Future studies are needed to assess if symptomatic or histological remission on PPI treatment is more capable of predicting a patient's risk of developing complications.
