Title: Innovative Percutaneous 3-Stitch Suture Technique for Site Closure in Venoarterial Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation Decannulation Without Direct Artery Repair: A Case Series.

Abstract: No previous studies have reported the use of a percutaneous suture technique performed by bedside intensivists for site closure during decannulation without direct artery repair in venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) cases. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this alternative approach. This retrospective study included 26 consecutive patients who underwent percutaneous VA-ECMO decannulation at Maoming People's Hospital. Bedside percutaneous suture technique performed by intensivists facilitated cannula site closure. Primary outcome was successful closure without additional interventions. Secondary outcomes included procedural time, surgical conversion rate, complications (bleeding, vascular/wound complications, neuropathy, lymphocele), procedure-related death. Follow-up ultrasound were conducted within 6 months after discharge. All patients achieved successful site hemostasis with a median procedural time of 28 minutes. Procedure-related complications included minor bleeding (7.7%), acute lower limb ischemia (15.4%), venous thrombus (11.5%), minor arterial stenosis (7.7%), wound infection (4.2%), delayed healing (15.4%), and wound secondary suturing (6.3%). No procedure-related deaths occurred. Follow-up vascular ultrasound revealed two cases (7.7%) of minor arterial stenosis. The perivascular suture technique may offer intensivists a safe and effective alternative method for access site closure without direct artery suture during ECMO decannulation.
