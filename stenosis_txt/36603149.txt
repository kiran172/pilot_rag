Title: The Slender Esophagus: Unrecognized Esophageal Narrowing in Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Inflammation in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) often leads to esophageal strictures. Evaluating esophageal narrowing is clinically challenging. We evaluated esophageal distensibility as related to disease activity, fibrosis, and dysphagia.
METHODS: Adult patients with and without EoE underwent endoscopy and distensibility measurements. Histology, distensibility, and symptoms were analyzed.
RESULTS: Patients with EoE had significantly lower distensibilities than controls. We found a cohort with esophageal diameter under 15 mm despite lack of dysphagia.
DISCUSSION: This study raises concern that current assessments of fibrostenosis are suboptimal. We describe a cohort with unrecognized slender esophagus that were identified through impedance planimetry measurements. This tool provides additional information beyond symptomatic, histologic, and endoscopic assessments.
