Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Symptomatic Severe Aortic Regurgitation Using the Self-Expanding Acurate neo Valve.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This case series describes use of the Acurate Neo transcatheter aortic valve in patients with symptomatic severe native aortic regurgitation (AR). TAVI is not currently mentioned in either the European Society of Cardiology or American College of Cardiology guidance for management of severe symptomatic AR. There are no randomised trials comparing the outcomes of patients with pure severe AR treated with a TAVI valve vs surgical aortic valve replacement (sAVR).
METHOD: We present a case series of four patients with isolated AR treated using the Acurate Neo valve (Boston Scientific). Each case had been turned down for sAVR but deemed suitable for TAVI after review at the structural heart multi-disciplinary team meeting. TAVI implantation was successful in each case with reduction or resolution of their AR and improved cardiac haemodynamics.
RESULTS: Three of the patients had significant symptomatic improvement, one had limited symptomatic improvement despite resolution of her AR on aortogram post TAVI.
CONCLUSION: Our case series adds to the growing literature that TAVI is a viable option for patients with pure AR but further long-term follow-up is required to assess the longevity and robustness of the valves.
