Title: Appendiceal Interposition for Ureteral Stricture Disease: Technique and Surgical Outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report our initial experience with ureteral appendiceal interposition (UAI) in a series of adult patients undergoing ureteral reconstruction for ureteral stricture.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data of patients who underwent UAI for ureteral stricture disease from December 2015 to March of 2020. Success of surgery was defined as one that required no subsequent procedural intervention for recurrent ureteral stricture disease, or loss of kidney function.
RESULTS: Eleven patients underwent UAI for ureteral stricture. Etiologies for stricture disease included radiation exposure, nephrolithiasis, and iatrogenic injury. Median follow-up was 363 days. Three patients had Clavien-Dindo class III complications during their hospitalization. No patient required repeat intervention due to recurrent ureteral stricture disease. On imaging, 9 patients had no obstruction on Lasix renal scan postoperatively, or improvement in hydronephrosis on CT scan. Two patients with poor renal function preop continued to show poor function after surgery.
CONCLUSION: The use of the appendix is a safe and feasible option for ureteral reconstruction in appropriately selected adult patients when primary ureteral repair is not possible.
