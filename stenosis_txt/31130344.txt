Title: Determinants of long-term outcome of repaired pulmonary valve stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: Although pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) is considered a low risk congenital heart disease, there have been reports of complications and the need for reintervention throughout follow-up. The aims of this study were to evaluate the long-term outcome of repaired PVS and to identify predictors of cardiovascular complications and reintervention.
METHODS: We studied 158 adult patients with repaired PVS (repair procedures performed from 1957 to 2010) receiving active follow-up in a tertiary referral center.
RESULTS: A total of 95 patients (60%) received surgical treatment, and 63 patients (40%) received percutaneous pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty. At the end of follow-up (27 years, IQR, 20-33 years), most patients (n=134, 84.8%) were in New York Heart Association functional class I, but 61 patients (38.6%) required a reintervention, mainly pulmonary valve replacement (17.7%, n=28), and 19 patients (12%) had at least one cardiovascular complication: 13 (8.2%) supraventricular arrhythmias, 6 (3.8%) heart failure, 5 (3.2%) stroke, 1 (0.6%) death, 1 (0.6%) thromboembolism, and 1 (0.6%) ventricular arrhythmia. Multivariate analysis showed that age at PVS repair (HR, 1.08; 95%CI, 1.04-1.12; PÂ <.001) and the presence of cyanosis before PVS repair (HR, 5.23; 95%CI, 1.99-13.78; P=.001) were independent predictors for cardiovascular complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Good long-term outcome can be expected after PVS repair, but complications and the need for reintervention may appear. Older age and the presence of cyanosis at PVS repair emerged as predictors of cardiovascular complications and identified a population that may merit stricter control.
