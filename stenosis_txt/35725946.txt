Title: Very low birth weight infants with congenital heart disease: A multicenter cohort study in Japan.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The frequency, mortality, and morbidity of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with congenital heart disease (CHD) in Asian countries are limited. In addition, little is known about the risk factors of death in these infants.
METHODS: A retrospective, multicenter cohort study was conducted. VLBW infants with CHD born between 2006 and 2010, and followed to 5 years of age, were included in the analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors of death.
RESULTS: Among 3247 VLBW infants, 126 various CHDs (3.9 %) were identified. The most common lesions were ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot (TOF), and coarctation of the aorta/interrupted aortic arch, in that order. The proportions of left-sided and right-sided outflow obstruction (TOF, pulmonary stenosis) were 15.1 % and 15.9 %, respectively. Trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 were present in 32 (25.4 %) of 126 VLBW infants with CHD. Nine patients were lost to follow-up. Overall, 45 patients (35.7 %) died up to 5 years of age. Serious CHD [odds ratio (OR), 19.2; 95 % confidential interval (CI), 3.94-93.11; p < 0.0001], sepsis (OR, 42.3; 95 % CI, 5.39-332.22; p < 0.0001), chromosomal /named anomalies (OR, 7.50; 95%CI, 2.09-26.94; p = 0.001), and no-invasive treatments (OR, 9.89; 95%CI, 2.28-42.91; p = 0.001) were associated with death. On excluding chromosomal anomalies, twelve of 71 patients (16.9 %) died, and only sepsis (OR, 35.5, 95%CI, 2.63-477.1; p = 0.0008) was an independent risk factor.
CONCLUSIONS: Trisomy 18 and trisomy 13 of chromosomal anomalies are frequently associated with VLBW infants with CHD. The mortality of VLBW infants with CHD is high, even when chromosomal anomalies are excluded. Sepsis has a significant impact on death in VLBW infants with CHD.
