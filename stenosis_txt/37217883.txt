Title: Bronchoscopy in the post-acute phase of COVID-19: an observational study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopy is a useful technique adopted in the management of patients with COVID-19. 10-40% of COVID-19 survivors experience persistent symptoms. A comprehensive description of the utility and safety of bronchoscopy in the management of patients with COVID-19 sequelae is lacking. The aim of the study was to evaluate the role of bronchoscopy in patients with suspected post-acute sequelae of COVID-19.
METHODS: An observational, retrospective study was carried out in Italy. Patients requiring bronchoscopy for suspected COVID-19 sequelae were enrolled.
RESULTS: 45 (21, 46.7%, female) patients were recruited. Bronchoscopy was more frequently indicated for patients with a previous critical disease. The most frequent indications were tracheal complications, mostly performed in patients who were hospitalized during the acute phase than treated at home (14, 48.3% VS. 1, 6.3%; p-value: 0.007) and persistent parenchymal infiltrates, more frequent in those treated at home (9, 56.3% VS. 5, 17.2%; p-value: 0.008). 3 (6.6%) patients after the first bronchoscopy required higher oxygen flow. Four patients were diagnosed with lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopy is a useful and safe technique in patients with suspected post-acute sequelae of COVID-19. The severity of acute disease plays a role in the rate and indications of bronchoscopy. Endoscopic procedures were mostly performed for tracheal complications in critical, hospitalized patients and for persistent lung parenchymal infiltrates in mild-moderate infections treated at home.
