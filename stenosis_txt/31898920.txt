Title: A New Appendicostomy Technique to Prevent Stomal Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Stomal stenosis has been reported to occur in 12% to 45% of patients following Malone antegrade continence enema and Mitrofanoff appendicostomy. The standard stoma technique entails excision of the distal appendix. We evaluated a novel technique with preservation of the appendiceal tip and vessels, and opening the lumen in a more proximal and vascular area to determine whether the incidence of stenosis would be decreased.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medical records of patients who underwent appendicostomy for Malone antegrade continence enema or urinary diversion were retrospectively evaluated. We included cases with a minimum of 1 year of followup and those in which the distal portion of a complete appendix was oriented for use as the stomal end in the umbilicus. Variables such as age, gender, body mass index, antegrade continence enema or urinary diversion, open or laparoscopic approach, cecal and appendiceal adhesions, retrocecal position, cecal imbrication, technique and stenosis were recorded. Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to determine association of covariates.
RESULTS: A total of 123 patients met inclusion criteria. The incidence of stenosis following standard stoma technique was 13% (12 of 93 patients) with a median followup of 9.4 years. Of these cases 75% occurred within 1 year of surgery. Stomal stenosis did not occur after the new stoma technique in 30 patients with a median followup of 3.3 years. Only technique cohort (standard vs new) was associated with stenosis (p=0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Stomal stenosis of appendicostomy may be lessened by preservation of the distal appendiceal vasculature and tip, and opening the lumen in a more proximal location.
