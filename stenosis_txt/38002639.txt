Title: Sex Differences in Clinical Outcomes after Aortic Valve Intervention for Isolated Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: There are known pathophysiologic and clinical differences according to sex in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). To evaluate if these differences persist after valve replacement, we conducted an observational study including 451 patients with symptomatic AS who survived aortic valve intervention (AVI) in two centers. Clinical data and mortality were evaluated at a mean follow-up of 5 years. 56% of patients were women. At baseline, women were older (80.6 vs. 78 years, p = 0.013), presented higher mean gradient (48 vs. 45 mmHg, p = 0.023), lower aortic valve area (0.70 vs. 0.74 cm2, p = 0.002) and higher systolic pulmonary artery pressure (36 vs. 33 mmHg, p = 0.016). They underwent percutaneous aortic valve replacement more frequently than men (47 vs. 35.9%, p = 0.017). At 5 years follow-up, women required more admissions due to heart failure (23 vs. 9%, p = 0.046) but they did not present higher cardiovascular nor overall mortality (27.7% vs. 29.8%, p = 0.741; 11.1 vs. 10.1%, p = 0.619, respectively). Female sex was an independent predictor of heart failure hospitalization at follow-up (HR 95% 1.16-4.22, p = 0.016). Women undergo AVI at a more advanced stage than men, resulting in a higher frequency of readmissions due to heart failure during the follow-up period, but not in higher mortality.
