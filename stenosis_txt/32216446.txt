Title: Is endoscopic treatment of small bowel strictures effective and safe in patients with Crohn's disease?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: there is very little scientific evidence about the efficacy of endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) performed with balloon-assisted enteroscopy (BAE) for the treatment of small bowel strictures (SBS) in Crohn's disease (CD).
OBJECTIVE: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EBD using BAE in patients with CD and SBS.
METHODS: a retrospective observational study was performed in a tertiary care medical center in patients with CD and SBS, evaluated by CT enterography or MRI enterography.
RESULTS: from 2009 to 2019, 205 endoscopic dilations were performed in 80 patients with CD. 17 (21.25 %) had only SBS and 70.6 % were male with a median age of 42.2 (±14.4) years. The mean follow-up was 37.8 ±28.7 months. A total of 39 dilations were performed, 94.1 % were native and less than 5cm long, all strictures were ulcerated. The overall technical success was 82.4 % and clinical success was 88.2 %. During follow-up, 23.5 % of patients required surgery and 29.4 % were re-dilated. The long-term efficacy was 76.5 % and no severe adverse events (AE) were observed. No factors were identified to predict the need for surgery after dilation.
CONCLUSIONS: SBS can be safely and effectively treated with EBD using BAE, thus reducing the need for surgery in the long term.
