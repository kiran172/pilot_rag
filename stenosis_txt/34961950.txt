Title: Ticagrelor versus aspirin and vein graft patency after coronary bypass: A randomized trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Antiplatelet therapy prevents saphenous vein graft (SVG) occlusion and improves outcomes after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG). However, the optimal postoperative antiplatelet regimen remains unclear. The goal of the Ticagrelor Antiplatelet Therapy to Reduce Graft Events and Thrombosis (TARGET) trial was to assess whether early postoperative ticagrelor reduces SVG occlusion compared to conventional aspirin therapy.
METHODS: In this multi-center double-blind randomized trial, 250 patients who had CABG with SVG were randomized to receive either aspirin 81 mg twice daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily. The primary outcome was SVG occlusion at 1 year.
RESULTS: Altogether, 123 patients were randomized to aspirin and 127 received ticagrelor. One-year graft assessment was performed in 202 patients (80.8%), examining 588 grafts, yielding an overall graft occlusion rate of 10.9%. The primary outcome, SVG occlusion at 1 year, did not significantly differ between the two groups (17.4% vs. 13.2%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .30). The incidence of vein grafts with any disease (stenosis or occlusion) did not significantly differ between the groups (21.5% vs. 22.3%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .90), and the number of patients with vein graft disease did not significantly differ between the groups (29.4% vs. 28.0%, aspirin vs. ticagrelor, p = .88). Freedom from major adverse cardiovascular events at 1 year was similar between the groups (p = .60).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to conventional aspirin therapy, ticagrelor did not significantly reduce vein graft occlusion 1 year after CABG. Further study will assess the impact of ticagrelor on 2-year graft patency for this cohort.
