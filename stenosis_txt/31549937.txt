Title: Long-term outcomes of open and endovascular treatment of recurrent carotid artery stenosis - a 16-year retrospective single centre case series.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate perioperative as well as long-term outcomes in patients operated with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or stenting (CAS) due to symptomatic or asymptomatic high-grade restenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA). Patients and methods: In a retrospective analysis of our electronic database including 2980 patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy or stenting due to a symptomatic or asymptomatic high-grade stenosis of the ICA, between 2000 and 2016, we enrolled 111 patients with recurrent ICA stenosis. Results: An ipsilateral 2nd time restenosis (&gt; 80 % in the asymptomatic and &gt; 50 % in the symptomatic patients according to NASCET criteria) of ICA was detected in 13 patients (12 %); 3 of them were symptomatic. These patients were managed with either CEA (n = 5/38 %) or CAS (n = 8/62 %) with no perioperative stroke or death. The stroke-free survival rates at 2 and 8 years for CEA were 98 % and 98 % versus 100 % and 100 % for CAS respectively (P = .271). The type of the initial procedure (patch, CAS or interposition) did not play any significant role for the development of a 2nd time restenosis (P = .841). Conclusions: Redo-CEA/CAS seem to have similar results as primary procedures (as reported in the literature) with favorable periprocedural and long-term outcomes.
