Title: New treatments for peripheral artery disease.

Abstract: The stenosis or occlusion of extremities defining peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events and adverse limb events including amputation. PAD is common, can occur without symptoms or with claudication, and is easily diagnosed. Proper diagnosis and adherence to guideline-directed therapy can reduce the morbidity and potential mortality associated with PAD.
