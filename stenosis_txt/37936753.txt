Title: Moya Moya Disease: A rare disease with a common presenting symptom in a chronic kidney disease patient.

Abstract: Moya Moya Disease (MDD) is a rare cerebrovascular pathology. It is non atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease characterized by bilateral internal carotid stenosis or occlusion, and abnormal vascular network at the base of the brain. Here we report a case of young female who presented in emergency with complaints of jerky movements of limbs for six months and history of recently developed unusual high blood pressure which was followed by uremic symptoms. Her workup revealed severe renal dysfunction required kidney replacement therapy (KRT) i.e., hemodialysis. During hospital stay her mental status deteriorated with a drop in GCS. Brain imaging performed and she found to have MMD. Her clinical course continued to deteriorate despite of extensive work up and aggressive management, she died eventually.
