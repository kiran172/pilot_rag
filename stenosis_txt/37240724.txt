Title: Echocardiographic Evaluation after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Comprehensive Review.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an increasingly popular treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis. Recent advancements in technology and imaging tools have significantly contributed to the success of TAVI procedures. Echocardiography plays a pivotal role in the evaluation of TAVI patients, both before and after the procedure. This review aims to provide an overview of the most recent technical advancements in echocardiography and their use in the follow-up of TAVI patients. In particular, the focus will be on the examination of the influence of TAVI on left and right ventricular function, which is frequently accompanied by other structural and functional alterations. Echocardiography has proven to be key also in detecting valve deterioration during extended follow-up. This review will provide valuable insights into the technical advancements in echocardiography and their role in the follow-up of TAVI patients.
