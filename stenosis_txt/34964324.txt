Title: [On the question of choosing a surgical approach when removing an osteoma of the external auditory canal].

Abstract: The article presents the results of the surgery treatment of osteomas in external auditory canals of 24 patients. The quantity and the location of osteomas with respect to the tympanic membrane determine a surgical approach. Retroauricular approach (n=19) was applied in cases of multiple osteomas or their close location with the tympanic membrane. Single osteomas located laterally of the isthmus of the external auditory canal were removed with the endaural approach (n=5). The overall follow-up period was 5 years. Postsurgical supervision did not register illness recurrence or any complications such as the trauma of the tympanic membrane or the stenosis of the external auditory canal.
