Title: The Safety and Efficacy of Endovascular Treatment in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients Caused by Large-Vessel Occlusion with Different Etiologies of Stroke: Data from ANGEL-ACT Registry.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of endovascular treatment (EVT) in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients caused by large-vessel occlusion (LVO) with different etiologies of stroke. A total of 928 AIS patients were assigned into intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS)-LVO, cardioembolic (CE)-LVO, and artery to artery embolism (ATA)-LVO groups. The safety and efficacy endpoints were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) at 24 h after EVT, 90-day favorable outcomes (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) of 0-2), successful recanalization (modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarct (mTICI) 2b/3), and complete recanalization (mTICI 3). The logistic regression analysis was used to determine the associations between the safety and efficacy endpoints. There were 305 (32.9%), 535 (57.6%), and 88 (9.5%) patients in ICAS-LVO, CE-LVO, and ATA-LVO groups, respectively. No significant difference was found in the 90-day mRS and successful recanalization among the three groups. However, compared with the ICAS-LVO group, complete recanalization rate was higher in the CE-LVO (adjusted odds ratio, 4.50; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.37-8.56) and ATA-LVO groups (aOR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.16-5.10). The results of subgroup analysis showed a significant association between CE-LVO stroke etiology and complete recanalization in the age population < 65 years old (aOR, 14.33; 95% CI, 4.39-46.79, P = 0.019). Functional outcomes were similar among different etiologies of stroke. CE-LVO and ATA-LVO could be related to a higher rate of complete recanalization, and there was a trend of the increased risk of parenchymal hemorrhage in the CE-LVO group.
