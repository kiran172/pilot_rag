Title: A Rare Case of Radiation-Associated Aortic and Mitral Valve Stenosis Treated With Transcatheter Valve Replacements.

Abstract: Radiation therapy is the standard of care for achieving cure for many thoracic malignancies, but it can result in long-term cardiovascular sequelae such as valve disease. We describe a rare case of severe aortic and mitral stenosis due to prior radiation therapy for giant cell tumor treated successfully with percutaneous aortic and off-label mitral valve replacements. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
