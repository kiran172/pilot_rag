Title: Intraventricular entrapment of a Sapien-3 balloon in transapical TAVR: A near missed catastrophe.

Abstract: Balloon rupture is an uncommon complication during balloon-expandable transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We describe a balloon rupture and tearing with intraventricular entrapment complicating transapical-TAVR, as well as our bailout retrieval of the failed device.
