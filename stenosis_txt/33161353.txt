Title: Endovascular Treatment of Symptomatic Intracranial Vertebrobasilar Stenosis: A 10-Year Single Centre Experience Using Balloon-Expandable Coronary Artery Stents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Symptomatic intracranial vertebro-basilar stenoses (SIVBS) are associated with high risk of recurrent ischemic stroke, even in patients receiving the best medical treatment. Although medical treatment is still the standard of care, non-responding patients may require endovascular treatment; balloon-mounted coronary stents (BMCS) could be successfully employed. This study aims to retrospectively analyze our high volume Interventional Neurovascular center ten-year experience in the off-label use of BMCS for the treatment of SIVBS, in order to assess its feasibility and safety.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive patients with SIVBS treated with BMCS in the last ten years in our center. Data collected included patient demographics, stenosis location and characteristics, early (<30 days) and late (>30 days) stroke and death rates, pre-symptomatic and post-treatment modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores.
RESULTS: 42 patients (35 males, average age 65,7 ± 10,7, range 37-85) with SIVBS were treated with BMCS. Thirty-four (80,9%) patients were symptomatic despite ongoing best medical therapy; eight (19,1%) patients were treated in emergency for large vessel occlusion, due to an underlying stenosis. BMCSs were successfully deployed in all cases. The incidence of stroke and death at one month was 7,1% (3/42). The incidence of TIA, stroke and death at long-term follow-up (average time of 3 years) was 14,3% (4,7 per 100 person-years). At long-term follow-up, mRS improved in 82% of patients who underwent elective treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, the off-label use of BMCS in the endovascular treatment of SIVBS resistant to medical treatment is feasible and safe.
