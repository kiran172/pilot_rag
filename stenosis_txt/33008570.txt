Title: A progress report on reimplantation of the aortic valve.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the late outcomes of reimplantation of the aortic valve (RAV) in patients followed prospectively since surgery.
METHODS: All 465 patients who had RAV from 1989 to 2018 were followed prospectively with periodic clinical and echocardiographic assessments. Mean follow-up was 10 ± 6 years and 98% complete.
RESULTS: Patients' mean age was 47 ± 5.1 years, and 78% were men. The aortic root aneurysm was associated with Marfan syndrome in 164 patients, Loeys-Dietz syndrome in 13, bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) in 67, and type A aortic dissection in 33. Aortic insufficiency (AI) was greater than mild in 298 patients. Concomitant procedures were performed in 105 patients. There were 5 operative and 51 late deaths. At 20 years, 69.1% of patients were alive and free from aortic valve reoperation, and the cumulative probability of aortic valve reoperation with death as a competing risk was 6.0%, and the cumulative probability of developing moderate or severe AI was 10.2%. Only time per 1-year interval was associated with the development of postoperative AI by multivariable analysis (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% confidence interval, >1.02-1.10; P = .006). Gradients across preserved BAV increased in 5 patients, and 1 required reoperation for aortic stenosis. Distal aortic dissections occurred in 22 patients, primarily in those with associated genetic syndromes.
CONCLUSIONS: RAV provides excellent long-term results, but there is a progressive rate of AI over time, and patients with BAV may develop aortic stenosis. Patients with genetic syndromes have a risk of distal aortic dissections. Continued surveillance after RAV is necessary.
