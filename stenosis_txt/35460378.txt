Title: Application value of overlap guiding tube (OGT) in assisting overlap esophagojejunostomy during laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) tumors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The overlap guiding tube (OGT) method, which was designed by our team to assist in overlap esophagojejunostomy, could potentially provide new perspectives for esophagojejunostomy. The application of the OGT-assisted method was first explored by our team and has not yet been reported.
METHODS: This cohort study analyzed the 3 month outcomes of 38 gastric/gastroesophageal junction (G/GEJ) tumor patients who underwent OGT-assisted overlap esophagojejunostomy.
RESULTS: There were 27 males and 11 females, aged 40-82 years. All patients underwent surgery successfully. The success rate of inserting anvil fork into esophageal lumen at first attempt was 97.4%. The total operation time, esophagojejunostomy time, volume of intraoperative blood loss, and length of surgical incision were 317.6 ± 51.5 min, 20.8 ± 3.8 min, 50.0 (range 15.0-200.0) ml, and 5.0 (range 4.0-8.0) cm, respectively. No procedures were converted to other laparoscopic anastomosis techniques or open approaches. The time to postoperative initial flatus, liquid diet intake, soft diet intake, and length of postoperative hospital stay were 3.0 (range 1.0-6.0) days, 4.0 (range 2.0-9.0)days, 6.0 (range 3.0-11.0) days, and 8.5 (range 6.0-16.0) days, respectively. Overall, postoperative complications were observed in 8 (21.1%) patients. Among them, one patients developed esophagojejunal anastomotic leakage. After 3 months of follow-up, none of the patients developed anastomotic stenosis or experienced unplanned secondary surgery or perioperative death.
CONCLUSIONS: OGT-assisted overlap esophagojejunostomy for patients with G/GEJ tumors is safe and feasible, with good short-term effects. OGT method has a satisfactory success rate of inserting anvil fork into esophageal lumen at first attempt and could prevent from developing esophageal submucosa pseudocanals.
