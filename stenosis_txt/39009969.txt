Title: Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans isolated from a human blood culture: a first report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, a Gram-stain-negative, rod-shaped, obligate anaerobic bacterium of the Oscillospiraceae family, has not been previously reported in human infections. This study reports the first case of bacteraemia and potential vertebral osteomyelitis caused by Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 82-year-old man with a history of diabetes, chronic renal failure, and prior spinal surgery for spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis presented with fever and lower back pain. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple vertebral osteomyelitis lesions. Initial blood cultures identified methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which prompted vancomycin treatment. However, repeated blood cultures not only confirmed persistent MRSA, but also detected Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Despite surgical removal of the spinal hardware and antimicrobial therapy, the patient's osteomyelitis worsened, necessitating transfer for further management. Subsequent analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing identified the GNB as Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documented instance of human infection with Ruthenibacterium lactatiformans, signifying its pathogenic potential in vertebral osteomyelitis. The involvement of anaerobic bacteria and the possibility of polymicrobial infections complicate the diagnosis and treatment of vertebral osteomyelitis. This report underscores the need for caution when identifying the causative organism and selecting an appropriate treatment.
