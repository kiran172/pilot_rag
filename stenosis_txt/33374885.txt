Title: Aortic Root Dilatation in Taiwanese Patients with Mucopolysaccharidoses and the Long-Term Effects of Enzyme Replacement Therapy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular abnormalities have been observed in patients with mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) of any type, with the most documented abnormalities being valvular regurgitation and stenosis and cardiac hypertrophy. Only a few studies have focused on aortic root dilatation and the long-term effects of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) in these patients.
METHODS: We reviewed echocardiograms of 125 Taiwanese MPS patients (age range, 0.1 to 19.1 years; 11 with MPS I, 49 with MPS II, 25 with MPS III, 29 with MPS IVA, and 11 with MPS VI). The aortic root diameter was measured at the sinus of Valsalva.
RESULTS: Aortic root dilatation (z score &gt;2) was observed in 47% of the MPS patients, including 66% of MPS IV, 51% of MPS II, 45% of MPS VI, 28% of MPS III, and 27% of MPS I patients. The mean aortic root diameter z score was 2.14 (n = 125). The patients with MPS IV had the most severe aortic root dilatation with a mean aortic root diameter z score of 3.03, followed by MPS II (2.12), MPS VI (2.06), MPS III (1.68), and MPS I (1.03). The aortic root diameter z score was positively correlated with increasing age (n = 125, p &lt; 0.01). For the patients with MPS II, III, and IV, aortic root diameter z score was also positively correlated with increasing age (p &lt; 0.01). For 16 patients who had received ERT and had follow-up echocardiographic data (range 2.0-16.2 years), the mean aortic root diameter z score change was -0.46 compared to baseline (baseline 2.49 versus follow-up 2.03, p = 0.490).
CONCLUSIONS: Aortic root dilatation was common in the patients with all types of MPS, with the most severe aortic root dilatation observed in those with MPS IV. The severity of aortic root dilatation worsened with increasing age, reinforcing the concept of the progressive nature of this disease. ERT for MPS appears to stabilize the progression of aortic root dilatation.
