Title: Inflammation, anti-inflammatory agents, and the role of colchicine in carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the last few years, the role of inflammation and inflammatory modulatory medications is investigated for the optimal treatment of coronary artery disease. It can be hypothesized that since inflammation is also involved in carotid artery stenosis development and progression, the same class of medication could be useful. Our objective with this review is to present the available evidence, published studies and promising ongoing trials on the role of anti-inflammatory medications - with a special emphasis on the most commonly used drug of this class: colchicine - in patients with carotid artery stenosis.
