Title: Atypical Shone's Complex Diagnosed at 70 Years Old: Presenting with Double-orifice Mitral Valve, Bicuspid Aortic Valve, and Aortic Coarctation.

Abstract: Atypical Shone's complex is a rare congenital anomaly involving a left-sided obstructive lesion of two or three cardiovascular levels. A 70-year-old man with dyspnea on exertion was diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis (AS) with a bicuspid valve, complicated by severe aortic coarctation (CoA) and a double-orifice mitral valve. He underwent surgery for AS and CoA in one session. It is important to search for complicated malformations, even in cases of bicuspid aortic valve found in old age.
