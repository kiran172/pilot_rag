Title: Prosthetic aortic valve endocarditis complicated by COVID-19 and hemorrhage.

Abstract: The novel coronavirus, now termed SARS-CoV-2, has caused a significant global impact in the space of 4 months. Almost all elective cardiac surgical operations have been postponed with only urgent and emergency operations being considered in order to maximise resource utilisation. We present a case of a 69-year old lady with an infected prosthetic aortic valve for consideration of urgent inpatient surgery. Despite being asymptomatic and testing negative initially for COVID-19 RT-PCR swab, further investigations with CT revealed suspicious findings. She subsequently tested positive on a repeat swab and unfortunately deteriorated rapidly with complications including gastro-intestinal and intracerebral haemorrhage.
