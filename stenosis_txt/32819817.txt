Title: Non-Invasive Cerebral Autoregulation Monitoring During Awake Carotid Endarterectomy Identifies Clinically Significant Brain Ischaemia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim was to evaluate the potential of near infrared spectrometry (NIRS) monitoring enhanced by autoregulation parameters to detect clamp ischaemia during awake carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: This was a prospective, hypothesis generating, single centre observational study. Fifty-nine consecutive patients with carotid artery stenosis, of whom 15 (25%) were symptomatic, were enrolled. The patients underwent awake CEA with NIRS monitoring. Regional oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>), relative tissue haemoglobin concentration (rTHb), and mean arterial blood pressure were captured by ICM + software (University of Cambridge Enterprise, Cambridge, UK). The cerebral oxygenation index (COx) and haemoglobin volume index (HVx) were calculated continuously. Two groups were formed depending on neurological symptoms: a symptomatic group with shunt insertion (shunt) and an asymptomatic group (no shunt).
RESULTS: Eight patients (14%) became symptomatic and needed intra-operative shunting. The decrease in ipsilateral rSO<sub>2</sub> was higher in the shunt group (13.5% vs. 5.3%) and rTHB increased on the non-operated side (+0.05 ± 0.01; p = .016). In symptomatic patients no significant change in rTHB was found during clamping, whereas in asymptomatic patients there was a bilateral increase (ipsilateral: + 0.06 [p = .022]; contralateral: + 0.06 [p = .010]). In asymptomatic patients, ipsilateral COx decreased after clamping (-0.06 ± 0.02; p = .024), indicating functional autoregulation. In symptomatic patients, ipsilateral COx increased to 0.32 (+0.19 ± 0.05; p = .048), indicating loss of autoregulation. Accordingly, pooled ipsilateral and contralateral data showed increasing HVx and COx in symptomatic patients (HVx, p &lt; .001; COx, p = .039).
CONCLUSION: In addition to a drop in rSO<sub>2</sub>, the loss of autoregulatory capacity may be useful in identifying clinically significant clamping ischaemia during CEA under general anaesthesia and may allow optimisation of blood pressure management during awake CEA.
