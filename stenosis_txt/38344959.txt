Title: [Endovascular treatment of deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremities].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To improve the results of treatment of deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremities sing endovascular technologies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed safety and effectiveness of treatment in 24 patients with deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremities. All ones were divided into 2 homogeneous groups by 12 people each. In the first group, conventional anticoagulation was performed. In the second group, we used additional regional catheter thrombolysis with alteplase and, if necessary, venous stenting or balloon angioplasty for residual stenosis. Patients received apixaban at baseline and throughout 6 postoperative months. After 12 months, we performed ultrasound and clinical examination to identify deep vein patency and venous outflow disorders. Vein recanalization was evaluated as follows: <50% - minimal, 50-99% - partial, 100% - complete. The quality of life of patients was studied using the SF-36 questionnaire.
RESULTS: In the first group, we observed complete vein recanalization in 25% of cases, partial - in 33%, minimal - in 41% of cases; in the second group - 83.3% and 16.7% of patients, respectively. In the first group, clinical manifestations of venous outflow disorders were absent in 25% of patients, mild disorders - 25%, moderate - 8.3%, severe - 41.7% of patients. In the second group, venous outflow was not impaired in 83.7% of patients, mild violations occurred in 16.7% of patients. In the first group, physical health was equal to 44.2±1.7 scores, psychological health - 49.3±2.3 scores; in the second group - 69.3±5.7 and 71.3±5.4 scores, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment improved postoperative outcomes.
