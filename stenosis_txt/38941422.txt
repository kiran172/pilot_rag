Title: The impact of instrumented lumbar fusion surgery on psychiatric problems in elderly patients with degenerative spinal stenosis: The observational study.

Abstract: This is a prospective cohort study to investigate the effects of instrumented lumbar fusion surgery on psychiatric problems, including anxiety, insomnia, and depression, in patients with degenerative spinal stenosis, as well as on pain and the activities of daily living. Surgery was performed in the patients with Schizas grade C or D spinal stenosis with; if a patient's quality of life was impaired for at least 3 months or if patient had neurologic deficits. Finally, 69 patients were reviewed. Beck anxiety inventory, insomnia severity index, geriatric depression scale short form-Korean, visual analog scale for back pain, visual analog scale for leg pain, and Oswestry disability index was measured on the day surgery was decided on (T1), the day before surgery (T2), the day before discharge (T3), and 6 months after surgery (T4). The patients had mild degrees of anxiety, insomnia, and depression at T1, and Beck anxiety inventory, insomnia severity index, visual analog scale for back pain, visual analog scale for leg pain, and Oswestry disability index improved significantly by T4. In elderly patients with degenerative spinal stenosis, instrumented lumbar fusion surgery improves not only pain and activities of daily living, but also anxiety and insomnia. However, there was no improvement in depression over the 6-month follow-up period.
