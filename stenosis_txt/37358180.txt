Title: Chronic angina secondary to Takayasu arteritis. Report of one case.

Abstract: Chronic coronary syndromes are usually considered uncommon in young women, related to slower progression of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, have atypical clinical presentations, and experience less diagnostic investigation. Non-atherosclerotic causes of coronary artery disease should be considered in young women experiencing angina. We report a 25-year-old woman who consulted for five months of moderate exertion angina. Physical examination revealed a right carotid bruit and asymmetrical upper extremity peripheral pulses. Initial work-up and imaging allowed to diagnose aortitis with bilateral coronary ostial stenosis secondary to Takayasu's arteritis. The patient experienced an apparent clinical response to initial medical therapy. However, follow-up evaluation revealed persistence of significant ischemia and requirement for myocardial revascularization. A percutaneous coronary intervention was performed.
