Title: Body Mass Index in Patients With Operatively-Excised Congenitally Bicuspid Aortic Valves Comparing Those With Stenotic to Those With Purely Regurgitant Valves.

Abstract: Several publications have examined the body mass index (BMI) in patients having aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis with and without a congenitally bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). The present study examines BMI in 536 adults having aortic valve replacement for a congenitally BAV and compares the BMI in those with stenotic vs those with purely regurgitant BAVs. No significant differences were found between the 2 groups.
