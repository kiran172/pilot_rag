Title: The incidence and risk factors of stent fracture in patients treated for proximal common carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to identify the incidence of and predictors for common carotid artery (CCA) stent fractures (SFs) and to examine the effect of SFs on the development of in-stent restenosis (ISR).
METHODS: Seventy patients (37 women; median age, 60.9 years) who were stented for significant (≥60%) proximal CCA stenosis from 2006 to 2016 and revisited us to determine SF using fluoroscopy in 2018 were evaluated. Seventy stents were deployed; among them 87.1% were balloon-expandable and 12.9% were self-expandable. SFs were classified as type I (fracture of one strut), type II (fracture of multiple struts without stent deformity), type III (fracture of multiple struts with stent deformity), type IV (complete fracture of the stent without a gap), and type V (complete fracture of the stent with a gap). Duplex ultrasound examination was used for monitoring stent patency. Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests, Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analyses, and a log-rank test and a gamma correlation analysis were applied as statistical methods.
RESULTS: The patients were followed for 75.5 months (range, 47-109 months). Significant (≥70%) ISR was observed in eight patients (11.4%). Reintervention was performed in four cases (5.7%). Twenty-seven SFs (38.6%; type I, 8; type II, 10; type III, 4; type IV, 2; and type V, 3) were found. Calcification was shown to be a significant predictor for SF (odds ratio, 13.2; 95% confidence interval, 3.9-45.1; P < .001). There was no significant difference between the fractured and the nonfractured group regarding the number of patients with ISR and reintervention (P = .701 and P = .636, respectively). Neither did the primary patency rates differ significantly (P = .372) in patients with and without SF.
CONCLUSIONS: Fractures frequently occur in a wide variety of stent devices deployed in the proximal CCA, but SFs seem to have no effect on ISR and reintervention.
