Title: Carotid occlusion of a giant intracavernous aneurysm on a single functional internal carotid artery.

Abstract: The prevalence of intracranial aneurysms (IA) is higher in patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA), the intracavernous internal carotid aneurysm is an intracranial aneurysm causing major functional and vital complications. We report the case of a 26-year-old man who consulted for a reduction in visual acuity, converging strabismus and ptosis of the right eye evolving for 7 months before his consultation, the various neuro-radiological examinations made it possible to identify diagnose a giant aneurysm of the right intracavernous internal carotid artery associated with severe stenosis of the contralateral internal carotid artery, hence the performance of a therapeutic arteriography consisting of an occlusion of this aneurysm. In summary, we describe successful management of a giant aneurysm of the intracavernous portion of a single functional internal carotid artery, while preserving optimal cerebral vascularization.
