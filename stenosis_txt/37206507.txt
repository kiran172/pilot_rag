Title: A Case of Subacute Stent Thrombosis.

Abstract: A 67-year-old male presenting with an anterior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) underwent stent placement in the left anterior descending coronary. The patient was discharged on an appropriate medical regimen containing dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). Four days later, the patient presented with repeat acute coronary syndrome symptomatology. Electrocardiogram demonstrated ongoing STEMI in the previously treated artery distribution. Emergency angiography revealed restenosis and total thrombotic occlusion. Post-intervention stenosis was 0% after aspiration thrombectomy and balloon angioplasty. Stent thrombosis is a high-mortality and therapeutically challenging condition requiring prepared clinicians who recognize predisposing risk factors and initiate early management.
