Title: Successful Antimicrobial Therapy of Esophageal Stenosis Because of Actinomycosis.

Abstract: Esophageal stenosis can cause vomiting or dysphagia in children and is commonly treated with esophageal balloon dilation. However, surgery may be required if the stenosis does not respond to dilation. Although esophageal actinomycosis can cause severe esophageal strictures and be refractory to balloon dilation, it has been reported to respond effectively to antimicrobial therapy in adults. However, the course of the disease and appropriate treatment strategies in children are not well understood. We present a case of a previously healthy 2-year-old boy diagnosed with esophageal stenosis because of actinomycosis. The patient was treated with intravenous penicillin G, followed by oral amoxicillin for 8 weeks and 6 months, respectively. After completion of the antimicrobial treatment, the patient showed improvement in symptoms and endoscopic findings. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient showed consistent weight gain and normal growth without further intervention. This case highlights the importance of considering esophageal actinomycosis as a potential cause of esophageal stenosis in children and the potential effectiveness of antimicrobial therapy in avoiding surgical intervention.
