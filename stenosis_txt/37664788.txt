Title: Comparison of guidewires for successful cannulation of biliary stenosis and targeting of biliary branches in ERCP.

Abstract: Background and study aims Guidewires play a crucial role in endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. The ability to pass through stenosis, and the ability to seek the desired biliary branch are particularly important. In this study, we aimed to compare these specific abilities in various guidewires by using a bile duct model. Patients and methods Seven 0.025-inch angle-type guidewires (VisiGlide2, Fielder 25, EndoSelector, NaviPro, Jagwire Plus, RevoWave DualMaster, and J-WIRE prologue ST) were evaluated. To compare these, a bile duct silicone model was prepared. The time from the entry of the guidewire into the common bile duct with the stenosis to the emergence of the guidewire from the common bile duct after reaching two target intrahepatic bile duct branches was measured. Results VisiGlide 2 and Fielder 25 were the fastest guidewires, whereas Jagwire Plus was the slowest. Conclusions In this study, a guidewire with a tip deflection height of approximately 9 mm and a hydrophilic coating length of 7 to 8 cm achieved the fastest completion time for the course. In clinical practice, it is important to consider the performance required in various scenarios and to select the most appropriate guidewire. The results of this model test, which focused on the time required to complete the course around the model, can serve as a foundation for guidewire selection. This method holds potential utility in future guidewire development.
