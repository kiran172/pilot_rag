Title: The 2023 Taiwan Stroke Society Guidelines for the management of patients with intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a major cause of ischemic stroke, especially in Asian populations, which has a high risk of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular comorbidities. The present guidelines aim to provide updated evidence-based recommendations for diagnosis and management of patients with ICAD. Taiwan Stroke Society guideline consensus group developed recommendations for management of patients with ICAD via consensus meetings based on updated evidences. Each proposed class of recommendation and level of evidence was approved by all members of the group. The guidelines cover six topics, including (1) epidemiology and diagnostic evaluation of ICAD, (2) nonpharmacological management of ICAD, (3) medical therapy for symptomatic ICAD, (4) endovascular thrombectomy and rescue therapy for acute ischemic stroke with underlying ICAD, (5) endovascular interventional therapy for postacute symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis, and (6) surgical treatment of chronic symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis. Intensive medical treatment including antiplatelet therapy, risk factor control, and life style modification are essential for patients with ICAD.
