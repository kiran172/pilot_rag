Title: Intraoperative Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Thoracic Surgery.

Abstract: Evidence supporting the utilization of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) outside the intensive care unit is limited. We present 3 clinical situations where intraoperative ECMO was beneficial. Peripheral venovenous cannulation was used to augment tracheal surgery in 2 patients, and in 1 patient who did not tolerate lung isolation. After surgery, all patients were de-cannulated and there were no complications observed due to ECMO. Use of this technology can greatly facilitate thoracic surgical procedures with low risk. ECMO should be considered when performing tracheal surgery and in situations of poor tolerance to lung isolation.
