Title: Association and Repair of Right Aortic Arch With Aberrant Left Subclavian Artery With Subclavian Stenosis.

Abstract: Surgical repair of right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery has traditionally involved ligamentum division. Such patients can have stenosis at the origin of the aberrant subclavian artery either at the time of presentation or later. The more recently popularized repair involving resection of Kommerell diverticulum with transfer of the subclavian artery to the left carotid artery allows resection of the stenotic segment and serves as an effective treatment for subclavian stenosis as well. We present three cases of early repair of this arch anomaly with associated subclavian stenosis repaired successfully in that manner.
