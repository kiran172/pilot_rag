Title: Combined endoscopic mAnagement of BiliaRy and gastrIc OutLET obstruction (CABRIOLET Study): A multicenter retrospective analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Combined biliary obstruction and gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) represent a challenging clinical scenario despite developments in therapeutic endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as GOO might impair EUS-guided biliary drainage. Little is known about the effectiveness of different therapeutic combinations used to treat double obstruction, especially regarding stent patency.
METHODS: All consecutive patients with double obstruction treated between 2016 and 2021 in three tertiary academic centres were eligible for inclusion. Five combinations involving enteral stenting (ES), EUS-guided gastroenterostomy (EUS-GE), hepaticogastrostomy (EUS-HGS), choledochoduodenostomy (EUS-CDS), and transpapillary biliary stenting (TPS) were evaluated for dysfunction during follow-up, either as proportions or dysfunction-free survival (DFS) using Kaplan-Meier estimates.
RESULTS: Ninety-three patients were included (male 46%; age 67 [interquartile range 60-76] years; pancreatic cancer 73%, metastatic 57%), resulting in 103 procedure combinations. Different combinations showed significantly different overall dysfunction rates (p = 0.009), ranging from the null rate of EUS-GE+HG to the 18% rate of EUS-GE+TPS, 31% of EUS-GE+EUS-CD, 53% of ES+TPS and 83% of ES+EUS-CDS. Sub-analyses restricted to biliary dysfunction confirmed these trends. A multivariate Cox proportional-hazards regression of DFS, a stenosis distal to the papilla (HR 3.2 [1.5-6.9]) and ES+EUS-CDS (HR 5.6 [2-15.7]) independently predicted dysfunction.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a lack of statistical power per combination, this study introduces new associations beyond the increased risk of GOO recurrence with ES versus EUS-GE. EUS-CDS showed reduced effectiveness and frequent dysfunction in the context of GOO, especially when combined with ES. EUS-GE+HGS or EUS-GE+TPS in this setting might result in superior patency. These results suggest that a prospective evaluation of the optimal endoscopic approach to malignant double obstruction is needed.
