Title: Successful implantation of self-expanding valve for a failed stentless prosthesis.

Abstract: Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation is currently used for failed bioprosthesis. The use of a transcatheter prosthesis in a regurgitant noncalcified root implanted Medtronic Freestyle prosthesis is particularly challenging. We present a successful transaxillary valve-in-valve implantation of a self-expandable transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis in a failed Freestyle bioprothesis implanted eleven years earlier. Tips and tricks are discussed.
