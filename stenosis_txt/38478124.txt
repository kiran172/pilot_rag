Title: Prolonged warm ischemia time in the recipient is associated with post-transplant biliary stricture following living-donor liver transplantation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Post-transplant biliary stricture (PBS) is a common and important complication following orthotopic liver transplantation (LT). This study clarified the incidence of PBS and identified its risk factors.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 67 patients who underwent living-donor LT (LDLT) at our institute between June 2010 and July 2022 and analyzed their clinical characteristics, prognosis, and risk factors for PBS.
RESULTS: Of the 67 patients, 26 (38.8%) developed PBS during the observation period. Multivariate analyses revealed the following independent risk factors for PBS formation: increased red cell transfusion volume per body weight (> 0.2 U/kg; hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; P = 0.002), increased portal vein pressure (PVP) at the end of LT (> 16 mmHg; HR, 2.88; P = 0.032), postoperative biliary leakage (HR, 4.58; P = 0.014), and prolonged warm ischemia time (WIT) (> 48 min; HR, 4.53; P = 0.008). In patients with PBS, the cumulative incidence of becoming stent free was significantly higher in patients with a WIT ≤ 48 min than in those with a WIT > 48 min (P = 0.038).
CONCLUSION: Prolonged WIT is associated with intractable PBS following LDLT.
