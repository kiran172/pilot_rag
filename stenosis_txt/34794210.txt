Title: Do previous urethral endoscopic procedures and preoperative self-dilatation increase the risk of stricture recurrence after urethroplasty?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relation between clinically relevant stricture recurrence after first urethroplasty and prior endoscopic treatments (dilatation and/or direct visual internal urethrotomy) or intermittent self-dilatation (ISD).
METHODS: Patients with bulbar urethral strictures treated with first urethroplasty between 2011 and April 2019 were included in a prospectively gathered database with standardized follow-up. Stricture recurrence was defined as any need for reintervention. Primary outcome was the analysis of recurrence risk after first urethroplasty in relation with the number of prior endoscopic treatments or performance of ISD. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Overall, 106 patients were included with a median follow-up of 12 months (interquartile range 8-13]. Reintervention was necessary in 16 patients (15%). Recurrence was more prevalent in patients with ≥3 prior endoscopic treatments (28%, P = .009). No increased risk of recurrence was found in patients with 1 or 2 prior endoscopic treatments. The prevalence of prior ISD was twice as high in the stricture recurrence group (56% vs 26%, P = .014), and ISD was performed in 61% of the patients with ≥3 prior endoscopic treatments (P < .001). The number of prior endoscopic interventions and performance of ISD were no independent predictors for recurrence in the multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the risk of recurrence after first urethroplasty is increased in patients with ≥3 prior endoscopic treatments and in those who performed ISD. Patients performing ISD more often had ≥3 prior endoscopic treatments. Prior endoscopic treatment and performance of ISD were not independent predictors of stricture recurrence.
