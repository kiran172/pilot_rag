Title: Comparing Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis in Patients With Bilateral Carotid Vulnerable Plaques Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Abstract: We compared plaque characteristics between symptomatic and asymptomatic sides in patients with bilateral carotid vulnerable plaques using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants (n = 67; mean age: 65.8 Â± 7.7 years, 61 males) with bilateral carotid vulnerable plaques were included. Vulnerable plaques were characterized by intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), large lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), or fibrous cap rupture (FCR) on MRI. Symptomatic vulnerable plaques showed greater plaque burden, LRNC volume (median: 221.4 vs 134.8 mm3, P = .003), IPH volume (median: 32.2 vs 22.5 mm3, P = .030), maximum percentage (Max%) LRNC (median: 51.3% vs 41.8%, P = .002), Max%IPH (median: 13.4% vs 9.5%, P = .022), cumulative slices of LRNC (median: 10 vs 8, P = .005), and more juxtaluminal IPH and/or thrombus (29.9% vs 6.0%, P = .001) and FCR (37.3% vs 16.4%, P = .007) than asymptomatic ones. After adjusting for plaque burden, differences in juxtaluminal IPH and/or thrombus (odds ratio [OR]: 5.49, 95% CI: 1.61-18.75, P = .007) and FCR (OR: 2.90, 95% CI: 1.16-7.24, P = .022) between bilateral sides remained statistically significant. For patients with bilateral carotid vulnerable plaques, symptomatic plaques had greater burden, more juxtaluminal IPH and/or thrombus, and FCR compared with asymptomatic ones. The differences in juxtaluminal IPH and/or thrombus and FCR between bilateral sides were independent of plaque burden.
