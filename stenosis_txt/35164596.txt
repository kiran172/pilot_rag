Title: Delamination and dissection of arteriovenous grafts: A multicenter report of four cases.

Abstract: Arteriovenous (AV) grafts are an alternative vascular access for chronic hemodialysis. AV graft failure is often due to stenosis of the feeding artery, graft, or draining vein. We report four cases of AV graft dysfunction and failure rarely caused by graft delamination and dissection. Two males and two females aged 47-67 years had been on chronic hemodialysis. Ultrasound examination detected graft delamination and dissection between 1 and 33 months after Acuseal AV graft implantation. Two cases were successfully treated with stenting and partial graft replacement, respectively. False lumen volume reduction by fluid withdrawal failed to salvage the delaminated graft in one of the patients. The delamination and dissection of another case spontaneously resolved 5 months later. Graft delamination and dissection should be considered as a possible cause for AV graft dysfunction and failure. Stenting and graft replacement may be recommended to treat AV graft dissection and delamination.
