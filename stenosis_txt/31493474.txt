Title: Angiographic contrast mechanism comparison between Simultaneous Non-contrast Angiography and intraPlaque hemorrhage (SNAP) sequence and Time of Flight (TOF) sequence for intracranial artery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To theoretically compare the MR angiography (MRA) contrast mechanism of Time of Flight (TOF) and Simultaneous Non-contrast Angiography and intraPlaque hemorrhage (SNAP) for intracranial artery imaging with in-vivo validation.
METHODS: The contrast ratio (CR) of SNAP and TOF was simulated under different blood velocities and travel distance that the blood had flown through. The CR and the slope of CR with respect to blood velocity of SNAP and TOF were compared in theoretical simulation. Two healthy subjects (a 60 years old female and a 29 years old male) were imaged on a 3 T MR scanner with SNAP, TOF and phase contrast (PC) images as the validation set. The measured CR from the images in validation set was compared with the theoretically simulated CR by Person's correlation coefficient. The ratio of CR difference to velocity difference in the validation set was compared between TOF and SNAP with Student's t-test. Thirty patients (21 males, age: 48 ± 13.8 years) with carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque were imaged with both TOF and SNAP as the comparison test. Between TOF and SNAP, the CR and total artery length were compared with Student's t-test, and the prevalence of stenosis was compared with Cohen's kappa in comparison test.
RESULTS: The theoretically simulated CR was significantly correlated with in-vivo measured CR from the validation set for TOF (p < 0.001) and SNAP (p < 0.001). The simulation revealed that the CR of SNAP was higher than that of TOF when the blood velocity and travel distance were within the range to have effective MRA contrast. Similarly, the in-vivo comparison test showed that SNAP had higher CR (p < 0.001 for all tested intracranial arteries) and longer total artery length (1.4 ± 0.4 m vs 1.2 ± 0.2 m, p < 0.001) than TOF. The stenosis detection performance was similar between TOF and SNAP (Cohen's kappa 0.72; 95% confidence interval: 0.51-0.93). Moreover, compared with TOF, SNAP showed higher slope of CR with respect to velocity in simulation (0.06 ± 0.02 s/cm vs 0.02 ± 0.05 s/cm, p < 0.001), and higher ratio of CR difference to velocity difference in validation test (0.47 ± 0.38 s/cm vs 0.19 ± 0.38 s/cm, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TOF, the SNAP shows better performance to visualize distal intracranial artery and worse performance to visualize ICA, and is more sensitive to blood velocity.
