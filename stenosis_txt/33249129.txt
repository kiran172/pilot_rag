Title: Long-term Outcome of Axillo-axillary Bypass in Patients with Subclavian or Innominate Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Subclavian or innominate artery stenosis (SAS) may cause upper extremity and cerebral ischemia. In patients with symptomatic subclavian or innominate artery stenosis, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is the treatment of first choice. When percutaneous transluminal angioplasty is technically restricted or unsuccessful, an extrathoracic bypass grafting, such as an axillo-axillary bypass can be considered. The patency rate of axillo-axillary bypass is often questioned. The aim of this study was to assess long-term outcomes of patients undergoing axillo-axillary bypass for subclavian or innominate artery stenosis (SAS) and to provide a literature overview.
METHODS: In this single-center study, data from patients who underwent axillo-axillary bypass for symptomatic SAS between 2002 and 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. Bypass material was Dacron® (54%) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) (46%). Primary outcome was graft patency and secondary outcome was the occurrence of mortality and stroke. In addition, a systematic literature search was performed in MEDLINE and EMBASE databases including all studies describing patency of axillo-axillary bypass.
RESULTS: In total, 28 axillo-axillary bypasses had been performed. Cumulative primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates at one year were 89%, 93%, and 96%, respectively. Cumulative primary, primary-assisted, and secondary patency rates at five years were 76%, 84%, and 87%, respectively. The primary-assisted patency rates at five years for Dacron® and PTFE were 93% and 73%, respectively. A total of four primary axillo-axillary bypass occlusions occurred (14%), with a mean of 12 months (range, 0.4-25) after operation. The 30-day mortality was 7%; one patient died after a stroke and one died of a myocardial infarction. At the first postoperative follow-up control, 22 of the 26 remaining patients (85%) had relief of symptoms. The literature search included 7 studies and described a one-year primary patency range of 93-100% (n = 137) and early postoperative adverse events included death (range, 0-13%) and stroke (range, 0-5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Patency rates of axillo-axillary bypasses for patients with a symptomatic SAS are good. However, the procedural complication rate in this series is high and attention should be paid to intervention indication.
