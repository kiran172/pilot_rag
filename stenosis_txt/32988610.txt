Title: A preliminary study on colour Doppler ultrasound for the evaluation of intervertebral stenosis of the vertebral artery.

Abstract: AIM: To determine the optimal thresholds for assessing intervertebral segment stenosis through haemodynamic parameters of colour Doppler ultrasound compared with computed tomography (CT) angiography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-four patients diagnosed with intervertebral stenosis on colour Doppler imaging were included. Twenty patients with normal vertebral arteries constituted a control group. Peak systolic velocity at the intervertebral stenosis (PSV<sub>IV-S</sub>) and the intervertebral segment distal to the stenosis (PSV<sub>IV-D</sub>), end diastolic velocity at the intervertebral stenosis (EDV<sub>IV-S</sub>), and the intervertebral segment distal to the stenosis (EDV<sub>IV-D</sub>) were measured, and the ratios of PSV<sub>IV-S</sub>/PSV<sub>IV-D</sub> and EDV<sub>IV-S</sub>/EDV<sub>IV-D</sub> were calculated. Cut-off values for the diagnosis of &lt;50%, 50-69%, and 70-99% stenosis were determined using a receiver operating characteristics curve.
RESULTS: The optimal cut-off values of haemodynamic parameters for evaluating the intervertebral artery for &lt;50% stenosis were PSV<sub>IV-S</sub> ≥81.5 cm/s, EDV<sub>IV-S</sub> ≥24.5 cm/s, PSV<sub>IV-S</sub>/PSV<sub>IV-D</sub> ≥1.49, and EDV<sub>IV-S</sub>/EDV<sub>IV-D</sub> ≥1.28; for 50-69% stenosis were PSV<sub>IV-S</sub> ≥137.5 cm/s, EDV<sub>IV-S</sub> ≥36.5 cm/s, PSV<sub>IV-S</sub>/PSV<sub>IV-D</sub> ≥3.14, and EDV<sub>IV-S</sub>/EDV<sub>IV-D</sub> ≥2.75; and for 70-99% stenosis were PSV<sub>IV-S</sub> ≥216 cm/s, EDV<sub>IV-S</sub> ≥55 cm/s, PSV<sub>IV-S</sub>/PSV<sub>IV-D</sub> ≥4.31, and EDV<sub>IV-S</sub>/EDV<sub>IV-D</sub> ≥4.16. PSV<sub>IV-S</sub>/PSV<sub>IV-D</sub> was the most superior haemodynamic parameter, with areas under the curve of 1.000, 0.906, and 0.968 for the diagnosis of &lt;50%, 50-69%, and 70-99% stenosis, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Colour Doppler sonography reliably identifies intervertebral stenosis. The results can be used as a preliminary reference for evaluating intervertebral stenosis.
