Title: Triglyceride glucose index and triglyceride HDL ratio as predictors of coronary artery stenosis in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: The current study investigated the association between triglyceride-glucose index (TyG) and triglyceride/HDL-C indices and coronary atherosclerosis extent in diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this case-control study, 1538 individuals were classified into two groups: diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Each group was further grouped as follows: (1) angiography+ (2) angiography-and (3) subjects without a history of cardiovascular diseases. The TyG and TG/HDL-C indices were compared between the subgroups of the diabetic (n = 407) and non-diabetic (n = 1131) groups. In both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, there was no significant association in TG/HDL-C; and diabetic subjects, angiography+ and angiography-groups had significantly higher TyG (p < 0.05). A high TyG index was associated with a higher risk of angiography+ (OR: 1.883 (1.410-2.514)).
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index, but not the TG/HDL-C, was an independent marker for predicting the severity of coronary stenosis in non-diabetic patients.
