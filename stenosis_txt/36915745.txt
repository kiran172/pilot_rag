Title: Clinical advantage of drug-coated balloon in treatment of restenosis in superficial femoral artery stents.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This investigation probed the clinical effectiveness of drug-coated balloon (DCB) and common balloon (CB) for treating restenosis in superficial femoral artery stents.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 295 patients with lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans with superficial femoral artery stenting restenosis admitted to Shaanxi Provincial People's Hospital from March 2017 to March 2020. Cases were segregated within two cohorts adopting different treatment methods (cohort 1, DCB and cohort 2, CB). The restenosis and clinical outcomes were evaluated by Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, or digital subtraction angiography at 1 week, 6, and 12 months.
RESULTS: Following six months, the restenosis rate on angiography was 4.2% within cohort 1, and 26% within cohort 2 (P&lt;0.05); at 12 months the rates on duplex ultrasonography were 18% and 84%, respectively (P&lt;0.001). ABI and MDL of cohort 1 (P&lt;0.05) were higher than those of cohort 2, 6 and 12 months post-operation; late lumen loss (LLL) and peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) of cohort 1 (P&lt;0.05) were lower than those of Cohort 2. Cohort 1 cases demonstrated increased mobility upon treadmill at 12 months compared to within cohort 2.
CONCLUSIONS: Medium-/long-term clinical effectiveness for drug-coated balloon treating restenosis in a superficial femoral artery stent is significantly higher than that of an ordinary balloon.
