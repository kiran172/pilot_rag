Title: Circulating ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 levels predict coronary artery atherosclerosis severity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We investigated the role of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 in atherosclerosis development and determined whether plasma concentrations of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 are related to the degree of coronary stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 305 consecutive patients with angina who underwent diagnostic coronary angiography were enrolled in the study between August 2017 and August 2018. The levels of ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 were measured by using competitive ELISA kits.
RESULTS: According to the degree of coronary artery stenosis, patients were classified into four types: coronary artery stenosis of < 10%, 10-50%, 50-75, and > 75%. The plasma ANGPTL3 level was higher (51.71 ± 52.67 vs. 24.65 ± 10.32 ng/mL, P < 0.001) and that of ANGPTL4 was lower (454.66 ± 269.05 vs. 875.49 ± 961.15 ng/mL, P < 0.001) in the coronary artery stenosis ≥ 10% group than in the < 10% group. ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 levels were significantly associated with the severity of coronary vascular stenosis. ROC curve analyses indicated that ANGPTL3 concentrations above 30.5 ng/mL can predict atherosclerosis with a sensitivity of 71.2% and specificity of 75.3%, and that ANGPTL4 levels below 497.5 ng/mL can predict atherosclerosis with a sensitivity of 63.9% and specificity of 74.5%. ANGPTL3 and ANGPTL4 were determined to be independent risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis with odds ratios (ORs) of 0.189 (95% CI 0.097-0.368, P < 0.001) and 3.625 (95% CI 1.873-7.016, P < 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased ANGPTL3 or decreased ANGPTL4 shows an association with coronary atherosclerosis and, may become a predictor of coronary atherosclerosis in the future.
