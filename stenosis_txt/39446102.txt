Title: Successful endoscopic management of severe low rectal stenosis caused by chemical burns.

Abstract: Chemical burns of the rectum are so rare that there are few cases reported about this situation. In fact, chemical burns of the rectum can cause severe serious consequence, such as bleeding, perforation and necrosis, even developing to persistent rectal stricture. Here we present a case report of a 12-year-old child with rectal stenosis who imitates the use of corkage and inserts rust remover into the rectum unsupervised by family members. He underwent endoscopic balloon dilation followed by submucosal injection of bleomycin at the stenosis point.
