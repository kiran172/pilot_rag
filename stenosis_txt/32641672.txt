Title: [Early Clinical Outcomes of Robotic Mitral Valve Repair;Initial Twenty Cases].

Abstract: We report the early results of our initial 20 consecutive robotic-assisted mitral valve repairs at our institution. A total of 20 patients (aged 55±10 years, 15 males) underwent robotic assisted mitral repairs by using da Vinci system. Successful mitral valve repairs were done in all cases. All patients received an annuloplasty band. Triangular resection were done in 2 cases and artificial chordae were used in 18 cases. There was no conversion to sternotomy intraoperatively. Three cases needed recross-clamping because of mitral regurgitation, mitral stenosis and the problem of venous canula. Cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp time were 272±56 minutes, 153±41 minutes. There were no hospital mortality and major complications. Post-pump echocardiograms showed no/trivial mitral regurgitation in all cases. Robotic-assisted mitral valve repairs were done safely and the early results were acceptable in our series.
