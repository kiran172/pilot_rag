Title: Combined Analysis of Myocardial Deformation and Oxygenation Detects Inducible Ischemia Unmasked by Breathing Maneuvers in Chronic Coronary Syndrome.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: In patients with chronic coronary syndromes, hyperventilation followed by apnea has been shown to unmask myocardium susceptible to inducible deoxygenation. The aim of this study was to assess whether such a provoked response is co-localized with myocardial dysfunction.
METHODS: A group of twenty-six CAD patients with a defined stenosis (quantitative coronary angiography &gt; 50%) underwent a cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) exam prior to revascularization. Healthy volunteers older than 50 years served as controls (n = 12). Participants hyperventilated for 60s followed by brief apnea. Oxygenation-sensitive images were analyzed for changes in myocardial oxygenation and strain.
RESULTS: In healthy subjects, hyperventilation resulted in global myocardial deoxygenation (-10.2 ± 8.2%, p &lt; 0.001) and augmented peak circumferential systolic strain (-3.3 ± 1.6%, p &lt; 0.001). At the end of apnea, myocardial signal intensity had increased (+9.1 ± 5.3%, p &lt; 0.001) and strain had normalized to baseline. CAD patients had a similar global oxygenation response to hyperventilation (-5.8 ± 9.6%, p = 0.085) but showed no change in peak strain from their resting state (-1.3 ± 1.6%), which was significantly attenuated in comparison the strain response observed in controls (p = 0.008). With apnea, the CAD patients showed an attenuated global oxygenation response to apnea compared to controls (+2.7 ± 6.2%, p &lt; 0.001). This was accompanied by a significant depression of peak strain (3.0 ± 1.7%, p &lt; 0.001), which also differed from the control response (p = 0.025). Regional analysis demonstrated that post-stenotic myocardium was most susceptible to de-oxygenation and systolic strain abnormalities during respiratory maneuvers. CMR measures at rest were unable to discriminate post-stenotic territory (p &gt; 0.05), yet this was significant for both myocardial oxygenation [area under the curve (AUC): 0.88, p &gt; 0.001] and peak strain (AUC: 0.73, p = 0.023) measured with apnea. A combined analysis of myocardial oxygenation and peak strain resulted in an incrementally higher AUC of 0.91, p &lt; 0.001 than strain alone.
CONCLUSION: In myocardium of patients with chronic coronary syndromes and primarily intermediate coronary stenoses, cine oxygenation-sensitive CMR can identify an impaired vascular and functional response to a vasoactive breathing maneuver stimulus indicative of inducible ischemia.
