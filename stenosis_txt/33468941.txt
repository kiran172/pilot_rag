Title: [Efficacy of Laparoscopic Gastrojejunal Bypass for Unresectable Gastric Cancer with Pyloric Stenosis].

Abstract: In general, gastrojejunal bypass is performed for unresectable gastric cancers with stenosis. It enables patients to take food and be discharged from the hospital earlier. Previously, we used to primarily perform open gastrojejunal bypass; however, recently, we perform laparoscopic gastrojejunal bypass because it is minimally invasive. We evaluated 31 patients who underwent gastrojejunal bypass for unresectable gastric cancer in our department between December 2009 and December 2019. We retrospectively compared the laparoscopic surgery group(n=7)with the open surgery group(n=24). No significant difference in patient background was found between the study groups. Compared to patients in the open surgery group, those in the laparoscopic group had significantly shorter postoperative hospital stay and time until initiation of oral intake, relatively lesser blood loss, and no postoperative complications. Moreover, more patients in the laparoscopic group than in the open surgery group were administered postoperative chemotherapy. Further, postoperative chemotherapy was administered sooner in the laparoscopic group than in the open surgery group. Laparoscopic gastrojejunal bypass is a safe and less invasive treatment for unresectable gastric cancer with stenosis. It may be superior to the conventional open surgery with regard to early postoperative chemotherapy for cancer.
