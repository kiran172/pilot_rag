Title: Early Australian experience with intravascular lithotripsy treatment of severe calcific coronary stenosis: IVL in acute/chronic coronary syndromes.

Abstract: AIMS: Calcified coronary stenoses are a serious impediment to optimal stent expansion and can lead to stent failure and catastrophic adverse outcomes. We hereby present early Australian experience with intravascular lithotripsy for the treatment of calcific lesions in acute and chronic coronary syndromes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a single-centre retrospective study of all patients treated with intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) between October 2019 and June 2021. Patient demographics, procedural variables, and treatment safety/efficacy outcomes were evaluated. During this period, there were 40 patients and 41 coronary lesions with IVL-assisted percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (70% male; mean age 72.8±9.5 years). Indications for PCI were acute coronary syndromes in 25 patients (62.5%), and stable angina in 15 patients (37.5%). Upfront IVL usage occurred in 5% of cases with the rest being bailout procedures due to suboptimal initial balloon predilatation or stent underexpansion. Angiographic success (<20% residual stenosis) occurred in 37 cases (92.5%), with mean residual stenosis of 8.25%±8.5%. Two patients experienced procedural complications (5%).
CONCLUSIONS: IVL appears to be a safe and effective modality in modifying coronary calcium to achieve optimal stent expansion in real-world practice. This device obviates the need for more complex lesion preparation strategies such as rotational or orbital atherectomy.
