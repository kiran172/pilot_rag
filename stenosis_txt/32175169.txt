Title: Parachute mitral valve: Morphology and surgical management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This review aims to discuss morphology and surgical management of parachute mitral valve.
METHODS: A total of 62 articles in the English language with 330 parachute mitral valve patients were retrieved from the PubMed, HighWire Press, and Cochrane Library databases using specific MeSH terms and keywords between January 2000 and December 2018. In these articles, morphology of parachute mitral valve and surgical treatment options were investigated.
RESULTS: A non-syndromic parachute mitral valve was present in 287 patients (87.0%) and a syndromic parachute mitral valve was present in 43 patients (13.0%). A higher number of patients with a non-syndromic parachute mitral valve presented with congestive heart failure compared to syndromic ones. The patients with a non-syndromic parachute mitral valve often had mitral regurgitation, while syndromic parachute mitral valve patients often had mitral stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Parachute mitral valves are usually not an isolated lesion and are often characterized by a constellation of pathological changes of the mitral valve leaflets, annulus, commissures, subvalvular apparatus, and supravalvular mitral ring. Therefore, the majority of the patients need one or more surgical operations. The incidence of adverse events such as reintervention, postoperative complete heart block, and mortality is high in these patients.
