Title: Body mass index and early outcomes after carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: As the existing data on the correlation of adiposity with adverse outcomes of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) are inconsistent, the aim of the present study is to examine the correlation of an increased body mass index with 30-day complications after carotid endarterectomy. The cohort study comprises 1586 CEAs, performed at the Clinic for Vascular Surgery in Belgrade, from 2012-2017. Out of them, 550 CEAs were performed in patients with normal body mass index (18.5-24.9), 750 in overweight (25.0-29.9), and 286 in obese (≥30) patients. The association of overweight and obesity with early outcomes of carotid endarterectomy was assessed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Overweight patients, in whom CEAs were performed, were significantly more frequently males, compared to normal weight patients-Odds Ratio (OR) 1.51 (95% confidence interval- 1.19-1.89). Moreover, overweight patients significantly more frequently had non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus-OR 1.44 (1.09-1.90), and more frequently used ACEI in hospital discharge therapy-OR 1.41 (1.07-1.84) than normal weight patients. Additionally, the CEAs in them were less frequently followed by bleedings-OR 0.37 (0.16-0.83). Compared to normal weight patients, obese patients were significantly younger-OR 0.98 (0.96-0.99), and with insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus-OR 1.83 (1.09-3.06) and OR 2.13 (1.50-3.01) respectively. They also more frequently had increased triglyceride levels-OR 1.36 (1.01-1.83), and more frequently used oral anticoagulants in therapy before the surgery-OR 2.16 (1.11-4.19). According to the results obtained, overweight and obesity were not associated with an increased death rate, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, myocardial infarction, or with minor complications, and the need for reoperation after carotid endarterectomy. The only exception was bleeding, which was significantly less frequent after CEA in overweight compared to normal weight patients.
