Title: Deferred revascularization in diabetic patient according to combined invasive functional and intravascular imaging data: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Invasive functional evaluation by fractional flow reserve (FFR) is considered as a gold standard for the evaluation of intermediate coronary stenosis. However, in patients with diabetes due to accelerated progression of atherosclerosis the outcome may be worse even in the presence of negative functional testing.
CASE SUMMARY: We present a case of 55-year-old male diabetic patient who was admitted for chest pain. Diagnostic coronary angiography disclosed 2 intermediate stenoses of the obtuse marginal branch with no evidence of restenosis on previously implanted stent. Patient undergone invasive functional testing of intermediate lesion with preserved FFR (0.88), low coronary flow reserve (1.2) and very high index of microvascular resistance (84). Due to discrepancy in invasive functional parameters, intravascular imaging with optical coherence tomography showed fibrotic stenoses without signs of thin-sup fibroatheroma. Because of the preserved FFR and no signs of vulnerable plaque, the interventional procedure was deferred and the patient continued with optimal medications.
CONCLUSION: Combined functional and anatomic imaging of intermediate coronary stenosis in diabetic patients represent comprehensive contemporary decision pathway in the management of the patients.
