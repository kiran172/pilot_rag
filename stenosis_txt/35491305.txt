Title: Is there a correlation between meatal stenosis severity, lower urinary tract symptoms and uroflowmetry?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: We have recently validated a meatal Stenosis (MS) severity grading system that is based on physical examination.
OBJECTIVES: The study objective was to examine the correlation between this grading system, patients' urinary symptoms, uroflowmetry and postvoid residual parameters.
STUDY DESIGN: Patients referred for our clinic for urinary and non-urinary complaints, were prospectively enrolled. Urinary symptoms questionnaire, uroflowmetry parameters and post-voiding residuals (PVR) were assessed, and photographs of the urethral meatus were taken for each patient. The photographs were graded blindly according to the previously validated grading system and correlated with urinary symptoms, uroflowmetry parameters and PVR.
RESULTS: Overall, 75 patients were assessed (20 grade 0, 23 grade 1 and 32 grade 2). When using grade 0 as a reference, the odds ratio (OR) for reporting narrow stream was 6.4 (95%CI 1.65-24.77) and 4 (95%CI 1.18-14.16) for grade 1 and 2 respectively. OR for prolonged urination was 6 (95% CI 1.47-24.89) for Grade 1 and 2; OR for upward stream deviation was10.08 (95%CI -2.43-41.82) for grade 1 and 15.12 (95%CI - 3.74-61.17) for grade 2. Uroflowmetry results showed lower Qmax from 16.8(SD ± 8.0) ml/sec in grade 0-9.6 ml/s on grade 1 and 2 (p < 0.001) (Figure 1). PVR was not statistically different in the three groups.
DISCUSSION: Our main findings were that meatal stenosis severity grade is associated with narrow stream as reported by parent, prolonged urination, and upward deviation of urinary stream, with increasing severity with worsening stenosis. MS grade was also associated with significant worsening of uroflow measures: a lower Qmax, Qmean and a longer time-to-Qmax. Post-void residual volume was not significantly different between the different severity grades. This study showed the clinical significance of the grading system. With subjective and objective measures. The implementation of this grading system in clinics, may aid in decision making regarding surgical intervention in the appropriate patients, and avoid unnecessary procedures.
CONCLUSION: The Severity of MS seen on physical examination correlates well with obstructive symptoms and decrease of urine stream seen on uroflowmetry. These findings confirm the importance of the grading system in the evaluation of patients with MS and may be additional measure that assist in consulting parents on the indications to meatotomy.
