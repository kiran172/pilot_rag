Title: Impact of left ventricular end-diastolic pressure as a marker for diastolic dysfunction on long-term outcomes in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the proportion of elevated left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) as an indicator of diastolic function after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and its implication in predicting long-term mortality.
METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively collected data on 3328 patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVR in our institution between July 2009 and June 2021. Patients were stratified into two groups based on invasive post-procedural LVEDP measurements: normal (<15 mmHg) vs. elevated (≥15 mmHg) LVEDP.
RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 81.6 years, and 53.3% were female. Elevated post-procedural LVEDP was identified in 2408 (72.3%) patients. The 5-year mortality rates were higher in the group with elevated LVEDP compared with the group with normal LVEDP (27.4% vs. 8.3%, p = 0.01; hazard ratio [HR] 1.22, 95% CI 1.05-1.41). A multivariate model revealed the following independent predictors of mortality after TAVR: post-procedural elevated LVEDP (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.01-1.53), pre-procedural significant tricuspid regurgitation (HR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.52) and pulmonary hypertension (PH) (HR 1.53, 95% CI 1.26-1.86). In the present study, a significant paravalvular leak after TAVR was not associated with higher mortality (HR 1.45, 95% CI-0.95-2.19, p = 0.75).
CONCLUSION: Elevated post-procedural LVEDP in patients who undergo TAVR is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. Furthermore, PH and tricuspid regurgitation were also identified as predictors of mortality. These data confirm that diastolic dysfunction is an important predictor of mortality in TAVR and should be considered to guide procedure timing, favoring an early interventional approach and management in aortic stenosis patients.
