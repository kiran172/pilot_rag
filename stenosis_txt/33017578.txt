Title: Long-Term Outcomes Stratified by Body Mass Index in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is emerging as the default strategy for older patients with severe, symptomatic, and trileaflet aortic stenosis. Increased body-mass index (BMI) is associated with a protective effect in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We assessed whether elevated BMI was associated with a similar association in TAVI. We evaluated prospectively collected data from 634 patients who underwent TAVI at 2 centers from August 2008 to April 2019. Patients were stratified as normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2, n = 214), overweight (25 to 29.9 kg/m2, n = 234), and obese (&gt;30 kg/m2, n = 185). Outcomes were reported according to VARC-2 criteria. Mortality was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis (median follow-up 2 years). Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate cumulative mortality. Baseline differences were seen in age (85 vs 84 vs 82, p &lt;0.001), STS-PROM score (4.3 vs 3.4 vs 3.6, p &lt;0.001), sex (50% vs 36% vs 55% female, p &lt;0.001), clinical frailty score (p = 0.02), diabetes (21% vs 29% vs 40%, p &lt;0.001), and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (13% vs 13% vs 23%, p = 0.009). On multivariable analysis there was no mortality difference between normal and obese patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, confidence interval [CI] 0.46 to 1.1 p = 0.11), however overweight patients had significantly lower mortality (HR 0.56 CI 0.38 to 0.85, p = 0.006). Variables independently associated with increased mortality were increasing age, male sex, COPD, previous balloon valvuloplasty, and higher STS-PROM. In conclusion, overweight patients have lower long-term mortality when compared with normal weight and obese patients undergoing TAVI.
