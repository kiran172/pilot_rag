Title: Spleen stiffness measurement as a non-invasive test to evaluate and monitor portal hypertension in children with extrahepatic portal vein obstruction.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to test the feasibility of spleen stiffness measurement (SSM) by two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) and compare data on its diagnostic use with upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in children with extrahepatic portal hypertension (EHPH) before and after surgery.
METHODS: A total of 44 children were included in this study [34 children with EHPH (main group)] and 10 controls (7.57 ± 1.22 years), who underwent ultrasonography including SSM by 2D-SWE. Patients in the main group also underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (UGE) and CT angiography. The main group was divided into three subgroups: Group A: patients with EHPH without large spontaneous portosystemic shunts (n = 15); Group B: patients with EHPH with large spontaneous portosystemic shunts (n = 9); Group C: patients with EHPVO and after surgical portosystemic shunts (n = 10).
RESULTS: According to UGE, children in group A had significantly higher grades of esophageal varices (EV) (2.3 ± 0.14; p < 0.001) compared to those in groups B and C. After surgical shunting procedures (in group C), the grade of EV declined to 0.37 ± 0.14. There was significant difference (p < 0.001) in the mean SS of children in group A (70 ± 4.64 kPa) compared to those in group B (37.04 ± 4.62 kPa) and group C (26.3 ± 2.9 kPa). After surgery, SS decreased but remained elevated compared with controls (26.3 ± 2.9 vs 17.85 ± 1.3 kPa; p = 0.016). The SS showed a small but significant correlation with grades of EV (r = 0.56, p = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The SS measured by 2D-SWE is feasible in children with EHPH and the results reflect the presence or degree of EV, thus elastography of spleen is useful in monitoring portal hypertension before and after shunt surgeries.
