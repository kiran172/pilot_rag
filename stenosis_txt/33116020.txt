Title: A New Aortic Arch Inclusion Technique with Frozen Elephant Trunk for Aortic Arch Aneurysm Treatment.

Abstract: Various surgical techniques have been proposed for treating aortic arch aneurysm (AAA); however, the optimal treatment has not been well defined. This study introduces a new aortic arch inclusion technique with frozen elephant trunk (FET) for AAA treatment.A retrospective analysis was performed among 22 patients for AAA surgical treatment between March 2010 and March 2019. Patients were classified into Z1, Z2, and Z3 groups based on the origins of aneurysms. A stent graft with a 10 cm stented graft and 5-9 cm proximal vascular prosthesis was released into the descending thoracic aorta as FET through an incision in the aortic arch. The proximal vascular prosthesis was retracted into the aortic arch, trimmed to expose the orifices of the brachiocephalic vessels, and sutured inside the aortic arch using the inclusion technique. The proximal sealing location of the vascular graft was tailored to cover the origins of aneurysms.There was no 30-day mortality. No patient had postoperative stroke or paraplegia. Complete aneurysm thrombosis was achieved in all patients. One patient died of severe respiratory tract stenosis 3 months postoperatively. All other 21 patients were alive during 53.3 Â± 36.5-month follow-up. Computed tomography angiography was obtained in 15 patients during follow-up. Endoleak was observed in one patient, and the other 14 patients were free from aneurysm-related or graft-related complications during follow-up.The aortic arch inclusion technique with FET provides an alternative technique in treating AAA with satisfactory mid-term follow-up results. A larger patient population with long-term follow-up results is warranted.
