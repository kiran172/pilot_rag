Title: FDG PET/CT in Cryptogenic Multifocal Ulcerating Stenosing Enteropathy.

Abstract: Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerating stenosing enteropathy (CMUSE) is a rare and exclusive small intestine disease, characterized by repeated anemia or obstruction resulting from multiple shallow ulcers with strictures in the small intestine. We present a case of CMUSE showing multiple foci of activity in the small bowel on FDG PET/CT. This case indicates that CMUSE should be included in the differential diagnosis of multifocal FDG activity in the small bowel along with lymphoma, carcinoma, tuberculosis, Crohn disease, Beh√ßet disease, and drug-induced enteropathy.
