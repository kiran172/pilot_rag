Title: One month follow-up of carotid endarterectomy with in-hospital preoperative aspirin monotherapy and postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients: A multi-center study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is currently no consensus regarding the optimal perioperative antiplatelet strategy for carotid artery surgery. This multicentre study aimed to analyse the association between preoperative aspirin monotherapy following postoperative dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and the risk for stroke and death after carotid endarterectomy (CEA).
METHODS: This cohort study included 821 patients with carotid artery stenosis who underwent CEA. Primary outcomes included any stroke or death up to the one-month postoperative follow-up. Multilevel multivariate regression analyses and descriptive statistics were performed.
RESULTS: Patients were predominantly male (53 %), with a mean age of 66.2 years. The primary outcome occurred in 1.6 % of patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exhibited a high risk for stroke or death (P = 0.011). The occurrence of any local complications in the neck was accompanied by an increase in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (P = 0.007). Patients with a high systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P = 0.002) experienced a longer operative duration. The length of hospital stay was longer in the patients with COPD (P = 0.020), minor stroke (P = 0.011), and major stroke (P = 0.001). A positive linear correlation was found between SBP and operative duration in the overall population (β 0.4 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.1-0.7]; P = 0.002). The resultant curve for DBP and any local complications in the neck exhibited a two-stage change and one breakpoint in the entire population (k = 68 mmHg, <68; odds ratio [OR] 0.9 [95 % CI 0.7-1.1], P = 0.461; ≥68: OR 1.1 [95 % CI 1.0-1.1], P = 0.003).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative aspirin monotherapy and postoperative DAPT were safe and effective antiplatelet treatments for patients who underwent CEA.
