Title: Risk of Cardiac Reoperation: An Analysis of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The increasing number of congenital heart disease patients undergoing reoperative cardiac surgery presents critical and growing challenges. Our objective was to evaluate the association between the number of prior cardiopulmonary bypass operations and operative mortality and morbidity in a national cohort.
METHODS: The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Congenital Heart Surgery Database (STS-CHSD) was reviewed for index cardiac operations on cardiopulmonary bypass during 2016 to 2021. Infants and patients with functionally univentricular physiology were excluded. Multivariable logistic regression adjusted for covariates in the STS-CHSD Mortality Risk Model, the STS-European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery (STAT) Mortality Category, and institutional volume.
RESULTS: Of 50,625 eligible operations, 22,100 (44%) were performed on patients with ≥1 prior cardiopulmonary bypass operations. Most common diagnoses were tetralogy of Fallot (4340 of 22,100 [19.6%]), pulmonary atresia/ventricular septal defect (1334 of 22,100 [6.0%]), and aortic stenosis (966 of 22,100 [4.4%]). Operative mortality correlated with number of prior cardiopulmonary bypass operations: 157 of 28,525 (0.6%) for 0, 127 of 13,488 (0.9%) for 1, 81 of 5,664 (1.4%) for 2, 61 of 2039 (3.0%) for 3, 35 of 623 (5.6%) for 4, 10 of 207 (4.8%) for 5, and 5 of 79 (6.3%) for ≥6 operations (P < .001). On multivariable analysis, patients with ≥3 prior cardiopulmonary bypass operations had higher risk of operative mortality (odds ratio, 2.31; P < .001) and major morbidity (odds ratio, 1.60; P < .001). Annual institutional volume and age were not associated with either outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: Three or more prior cardiopulmonary bypass operations was an independent risk factor for operative mortality/morbidity, even after controlling for risk factors and institutional volume. Future research is needed to identify modifiable factors to optimize outcomes, particularly for those with ≥3 prior cardiopulmonary bypass operations.
