Title: [Multiple Extracarciac Complications of Infective Endocarditis: Report of One Case].

Abstract: Infective endocarditis is a microbial infection of the endocardium and can easily affect heart valve.Its characteristic lesion is vegetation formation,and the shedding of vegetation results in arterial embolism and ischemic necrosis of corresponding tissues and organs.A case of infective endocarditis with multiple extracardiac complications was described in this article.The characteristic ultrasound finding was the vegetation formation in anterior mitral valve.CT and MRI scans revealed involvements in multiple organs and blood vessels,which were manifested as splenic infarction,renal infarction,cerebral infarction,splenic aneurysm,superior mesenteric artery aneurysms,renal artery aneurysms,and distal segment stenosis and occlusion of right middle cerebral artery.
