Title: Aortic valve repair using geometric ring annuloplasty in pediatric and congenital heart disease patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Existing replacement options for the aortic valve have significant drawbacks, especially in children. A geometric annuloplasty ring can help to achieve consistently successful aortic valve repair, but only limited experience with use of this device has been reported in pediatric and congenital heart disease patients.
METHODS: All pediatric and adult congenital patients at our institution who underwent aortic valve repair with placement of a geometric annuloplasty ring were reviewed. The study period spanned from July 2018 to April 2022. Hemodynamic outcomes were evaluated using transthoracic echocardiography.
RESULTS: The study included 36 subjects. The median age was 17.4 years (range, 8-30 years). Twenty-one subjects were younger than age 18 years. The most common primary diagnoses were neoaortic valve insufficiency or neoaortic root dilation, and congenital aortic stenosis with bicuspid or functionally unicuspid aortic valve. Of the 34 subjects with procedural success, 31 (91%) had use of additional valve repair techniques and 26 (76%) had an additional concomitant procedure performed. Operative mortality was 0% (0/33), and major complication rate was 6% (2/33). The median follow-up time was 1.9 years (maximum, 3.8 years). The mean grade of aortic insufficiency was signific antly reduced after repair, with no change in mean gradients. Freedom from reoperation over the follow-up period was 97% (33/34), and freedom from ≥3+ recurrent aortic insufficiency was 94% (32/34).
CONCLUSIONS: A geometric annuloplasty ring can be used to help achieve consistently successful aortic valve repair with excellent perioperative and follow-up outcomes, even in pediatric and complex congenital heart disease patients.
