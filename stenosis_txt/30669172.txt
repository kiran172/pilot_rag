Title: Clinical Short-Term Outcome and Hemodynamic Comparison of Six Contemporary Bovine Aortic Valve Prostheses.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Conventional stented valves (CV) remain gold standard for aortic valve disease. Bovine prostheses have been improved and rapid deployment valves (RDV) have arrived in the recent decade. We compare clinical and hemodynamic short-term outcome of six bovine valves.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated 829 consecutive patients (all-comers) receiving bovine aortic valve replacement (AVR). Four CV from different manufacturers (Mitroflow, Crown, Perimount, Trifecta) and two RDV (Perceval, Intuity) were compared in terms of pre-, intra-, and postprocedural data. A risk model for mortality was created.
RESULTS: All valves reduced gradients. From 23 mm, all CV showed acceptable gradients. Twenty-one millimeter Mitroflow/Perceval and 19 mm Crown showed above-average gradients. As baseline data differed, we performed propensity matching between aggregated isolated CV and RDV groups. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), clamp, and surgery times were shorter with RDV (87.4 ± 34.0 min vs 111.0 ± 34.2, 54.3 ± 21.1 vs 74.9 ± 20.4, 155.2 ± 42.9 vs 178.0 ± 46.8, p &lt; 0.001). New pacemaker rate (10.1 vs 1.3%, p = 0.016) and the tendency toward neurologic events (8.9 vs 2.5%, p = 0.086) were higher using RDV, induced mainly by the Perceval. Early mortality was equal (2.5 vs 1.3%, p = 0.560). Revision for bleeding, dialysis, blood products, length-of-stay, gradients, and regurgitation was also equal. Risk analysis showed that low valve size, low ejection fraction, endocarditis, administration of red cells, and prolonged CPB time were predictors of elevated mortality.
CONCLUSION: Isolated bovine AVR has low mortality. Valves ≥ 23 mm show comparable gradients while the valve model matters < 23 mm. RDV should be used with care. Procedure-related times are shorter than those of CV but pacemaker implantation and neurologic events are more frequent (Perceval). Early mortality is low and valve performance comparable to CV.
