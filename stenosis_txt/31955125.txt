Title: Probable risk factors of internal jugular vein stenosis in Chinese patients-A real-world cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Extracranial venous anomalies, especially internal jugular vein stenosis (IJVS), have recently received increasing attention, however, its etiologies are uncertain. This study aimed to explore the probable risk factors of IJVS in Chinese PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients with IJVS confirmed by contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography (CE-MRV) were enrolled from October 2017 through October 2018. Probable risk factors were analyzed, including the conditions that may result in IJV wall damage, extraluminal compression, gender and age.
RESULTS: A total of 133 patients enrolled in the final analysis, including 73 females and 60 males, the mean age were 54.83 ± 15.25 years. In this IJVS cohort, the top two risks were previous hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection (48.9 %) and osseous compression (41.4 %). The IJVS cohort was divided into two subsets: extraluminal compression and non-compression. In the former, osseous compression (80.9 %) was the top risk factor, other risks including arterial (22.1 %) and lymph node compression (2.9 %). While, in the latter subset, the most common risk factor was previous HBV infection (46.2 %). In addition, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) in non-compression subset was more common than that in extraluminal compression subset (21.5 % VS. 2.9 %, p = 0.001). When considered the gender (Male vs. Female), the ratios were 28.3 % vs. 0 % of smoking, p < 0.001, 16.67 % vs. 1.37 % of hyperhomocysteinemia, p = 0.002, and 11.67 % vs. 1.37 % of hyperuricemia, p = 0.023. In the subset with age less than 45 years, the top three risks included CVST (56.25 %), immunological diseases (55.56 %), and hyperhomocysteinemia (50.00 %), while, in the subset with the ages over 60 years, type-2 diabetes (66.66 %), carotid artery compression (53.33 %), previous HBV infection (52.31 %), and osseous compression (49.09 %) were more common than others.
CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the probable risks of IJVS may be diverse, in which osseous compression and previous HBV infection may be the top two probable risks of IJVS in Chinese. This is the biggest difference from previous reports based on Caucasian.
