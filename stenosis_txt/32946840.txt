Title: Right Ventricle to Pulmonary Artery Conduit With Tricuspid Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene Valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Excellent outcomes of right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduits with expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) valves have been reported. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the outcomes of the different material conduits with tricuspid ePTFE valves.
METHODS: Forty-one consecutive patients who received right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit with tricuspid ePTFE valves for biventricular repair between April 2004 and December 2016 were studied. The conduits made of autologous pericardial roll or xenograft roll were used in 22 patients (group P) and the conduits made of ePTFE tube were used in 19 patients (group G). The conduit reoperation and the conduit dysfunction were analyzed.
RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 5.8 years, no death related to the conduit was observed. There were four reoperations (three in group P and one in group G). Freedom from conduit reoperation at 5 years was 100% in both groups (P = .30). Freedom from more than moderate conduit stenosis at 5 years after operation was not significantly different between groups (46.9% in group P vs 76.3% in group G, P = .23) even though the group G conduits were significantly smaller and freedom from more than moderate conduit regurgitation at 5 years was significantly better in group G (63.3% in group P vs 94.1% in group G, P = .04).
CONCLUSIONS: The conduit with ePTFE valves in the ePTFE tubes had better conduit function compared with the conduit with autologous pericardial or xenograft roll, especially in terms of conduit regurgitation.
