Title: Spontaneous retroperitoneal haemorrhage following re-perfusion of an ischaemic kidney leading to emergency trauma nephrectomy.

Abstract: Here we present a rare case of life-threatening spontaneous renal haemorrhage following elective vascular surgery. A 73-year-old gentleman presents to the ED with acute onset right sided flank pain, 24 hours post bilateral renal artery stent insertion for renal artery stenosis. Subsequent angiography demonstrated bilateral renal artery stent occlusion with near complete bilateral kidney infarction. The patient urgently underwent bilateral renal artery thrombectomy. Post-operatively the patient developed severe unilateral flank pain and became haemodynamically unstable. Subsequent imaging revealed a large right sided retroperitoneal haematoma with active arterial bleeding. The patient ultimately underwent a right sided trauma nephrectomy for haemorrhage control.
