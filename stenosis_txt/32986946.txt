Title: Association Between Latency of Dermatomal Sensory-Evoked Potentials and Quantitative Radiologic Findings of Narrowing in Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify the difference of quantitative radiologic stenosis between a normal latency group and an abnormal latency group, and to investigate the association of dermatomal somatosensory-evoked potential (DSEP) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of narrowing in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records and P40 latencies of L5 DSEP of 40 patients with unilateral symptoms of LSS at the L4-5 disc level. Quantitative assessments of stenosis in lumbar spine MRI were performed with measurements of the anteroposterior diameter (APD), cross-sectional area (CSA) of the dural sac, ligamentous interfacet distance (LID), CSA of the neural foramen (CSA-NF), and subarticular zone width. Analyses were conducted through comparisons of radiologic severity between the normal and abnormal latency groups and correlation between radiologic severity of stenosis and latency of DSEP in absolute (APD <10 mm) and relative (APD <13 mm) stenosis.
RESULTS: The radiologic severities of lumbar stenosis were not significantly different between the normal and abnormal latency groups. In absolute and relative stenosis, latency showed a significant negative correlation with APD (r=-0.539, r=-0.426) and LID (r=-0.459, r=-0.494). In patients with relative stenosis, a weak significant positive correlation was found between latency and CSA-NF (r=0.371, p=0.048). LID was the only significant factor for latency (Î²=-0.930, p=0.011).
CONCLUSION: The normal and abnormal DSEP groups showed no significant differences inradiologic severity. The latency of DSEP had a negative correlation with the severity of central stenosis, and LID was an influencing factor.
