Title: Long-Term Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients With Chronic Inflammatory Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Chronic inflammatory disease (CID) accelerates atherosclerosis and the development of aortic stenosis. Data on long-term outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in those patients are missing. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical long-term outcomes of patients with and without autoimmune-related CID undergoing TAVI for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis.
METHODS AND RESULTS: From a prospective registry, consecutive patients with TAVI were included. Baseline clinic and imaging data (echocardiographic and computed tomography) were analyzed. Long-term (up to 5 years) clinical and echocardiographic outcomes were studied. Of 1000 consecutive patients (mean age 81±6 years, 46% female), 107 (11%) had CID; the most frequent entities included polymyalgia rheumatica (31%) and rheumatoid arthritis (28%). Patients with CID were predominantly female (60% versus 44%, P=0.002) and more often had pulmonary disorders (21% versus 13%, P=0.046) and atrial fibrillation (32% versus 20%, P=0.003). The presence of CID was associated with a higher rate of postinterventional infection (5% versus 1%, P=0.007) and further emerged as a risk factor for rehospitalization for bleeding or infection (hazard ratio, 1.93 and 1.62, respectively). Premature valve degeneration, endocarditis, and all-cause mortality were not increased among patients with CID.
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world analysis found that patients with CID undergoing TAVI were associated with a higher risk of postinterventional infectious complications and rehospitalization due to infection. However, valve durability and survival seem not to differ between patients with TAVI with versus without CID.
