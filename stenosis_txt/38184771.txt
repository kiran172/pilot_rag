Title: Prediction of Venous Trans-Stenotic Pressure Gradient Using Shape Features Derived From Magnetic Resonance Venography in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition of unknown etiology associated with venous sinus stenosis. This study aimed to develop a magnetic resonance venography (MRV)-based radiomics model for predicting a high trans-stenotic pressure gradient (TPG) in IIH patients diagnosed with venous sinus stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 105 IIH patients (median age [interquartile range], 35 years [27-42 years]; female:male, 82:23) who underwent MRV and catheter venography complemented by venous manometry. Contrast enhanced-MRV was conducted under 1.5 Tesla system, and the images were reconstructed using a standard algorithm. Shape features were derived from MRV images via the PyRadiomics package and selected by utilizing the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method. A radiomics score for predicting high TPG (â‰¥ 8 mmHg) in IIH patients was formulated using multivariable logistic regression; its discrimination performance was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). A nomogram was constructed by incorporating the radiomics scores and clinical features.
RESULTS: Data from 105 patients were randomly divided into two distinct datasets for model training (n = 73; 50 and 23 with and without high TPG, respectively) and testing (n = 32; 22 and 10 with and without high TPG, respectively). Three informative shape features were identified in the training datasets: least axis length, sphericity, and maximum three-dimensional diameter. The radiomics score for predicting high TPG in IIH patients demonstrated an AUROC of 0.906 (95% confidence interval, 0.836-0.976) in the training dataset and 0.877 (95% confidence interval, 0.755-0.999) in the test dataset. The nomogram showed good calibration.
CONCLUSION: Our study presents the feasibility of a novel model for predicting high TPG in IIH patients using radiomics analysis of noninvasive MRV-based shape features. This information may aid clinicians in identifying patients who may benefit from stenting.
