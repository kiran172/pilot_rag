Title: Early and Mid-term Efficacy of Fenestrated Endograft in the Treatment of Juxta-Renal Aortic Aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to report early and mid-term outcomes of fenestrated endografting (FEVAR) for juxtarenal aneurysm (J-AAAs).
METHODS: Between 2008 and 2017, all consecutive J-AAAs treated by FEVAR were prospectively collected. Early endpoints were technical success, renal function worsening, and 30-day mortality. Follow-up endpoints were survival, freedom from reinterventions (FFRs), target visceral vessels (TVVs) patency, J-AAAs shrinkage, and renal function worsening.
RESULTS: Among 181 cases who underwent FB-EVAR, 66 (36%) were J-AAAs. Endograft with 1, 2, 3, and 4 fenestrations were planned in 2 (3%), 22 (33%), 27 (41%) and 15 (23%) cases, respectively. Overall, 236 TVVs were treated by fenestrations and scallops. Technical success was achieved in 65 (99%) cases. The only failure occurred for a type III endoleak requiring renal artery relining. No TVVs were lost. Renal function worsening occurred in 7 (10%) cases: 4 returned to baseline within 30-day, 1 required hemodialysis and died within 30 days (1.5%). This was the only case of 30-day mortality. The mean follow-up was 46 ± 32 months. Aneurysm sac shrinkage or stability was observed in 42 (64%) and 22 (33%) cases, respectively. Two patients (3%) with persistent type II endoleak had sac enlargement and required reinterventions. Freedom from reinterventions at 5 years was 88%. An asymptomatic celiac trunk occlusion (accommodated by a scallop) occurred at 24 months in a case with a severe preoperative stenosis. No late renal arteries occlusions or type I-III endoleaks occurred. Overall, renal function worsening was reported in 5 (8%) patients during follow-up. Survival at 5 years was 67%, with no j-AAA-related mortality. COPD was the only independent predictor for mortality at the multivariate analysis (P: 0.021; OR: 5.3; 95% CI, 1.3-21.9).
CONCLUSIONS: FEVAR for J-AAAs is safe and effective at early and mid-term follow-up. According to these results, it could be proposed as the first-line treatment in high-risk patients if anatomically fit. Long-term survival is reduced in the presence of preoperative COPD.
