Title: Incoercible Vomiting in a Polycystic (ADPKD) Patient on Peritoneal Dialysis.

Abstract: Although gastrointestinal symptoms are not uncommon in PD patients due to several causes, such as infusion volume with early satiety, constipation, or peritonitis, sometimes the differential diagnosis is more challenging for nephrologists. We present the case of a woman with end-stage renal disease due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease on PD who presented with swollen legs and incoercible vomiting. After ruling out constipation and infection, an abdominal CT was done, revealing extrinsic compression of the intrahepatic inferior cava vein (ICV) and massive venous thrombosis from ICV to bilateral iliofemoral deep veins. In addition, CT also showed displacement and extrinsic compression of the stomach, pylorus, and duodenum due to an enlarged liver cyst. Percutaneous drainage and sclerosis of the cyst compressing the stomach was performed, anticoagulation was started, and the patient clinically improved with complete resolution of symptoms.
