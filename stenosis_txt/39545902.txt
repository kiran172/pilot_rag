Title: Oxidized Phospholipids and Calcific Aortic Valvular Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Oxidized phospholipids (OxPLs) are carried by apolipoprotein B-100-containing lipoproteins (OxPL-apoB) including lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]). Both OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) have been associated with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD).
OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the associations between OxPL-apoB, Lp(a) and the prevalence, incidence, and progression of CAVD.
METHODS: OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) were evaluated in MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis) and a participant-level meta-analysis of 4 randomized trials of participants with established aortic stenosis (AS). In MESA, the association of OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) with aortic valve calcium (AVC) at baseline and 9.5 years was evaluated using multivariable ordinal regression models. In the meta-analysis, the association between OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) with AS progression (annualized change in peak aortic valve jet velocity) was evaluated using multivariable linear regression models.
RESULTS: In MESA, both OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) were associated with prevalent AVC (OR per SD: 1.19 [95% CI: 1.07-1.32] and 1.13 [95% CI: 1.01-1.27], respectively) with a significant interaction between the two (P < 0.01). Both OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) were associated with incident AVC at 9.5 years when evaluated individually (interaction P < 0.01). The OxPL-apoB∗Lp(a) interaction demonstrated higher odds of prevalent and incident AVC for OxPL-apoB with increasing Lp(a) levels. In the meta-analysis, when analyzed separately, both OxPL-apoB and Lp(a) were associated with faster increase in peak aortic valve jet velocity, but when evaluated together, only OxPL-apoB remained significant (ß: 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01-0.12).
CONCLUSIONS: OxPL-apoB is a predictor of the presence, incidence, and progression of AVC and established AS, particularly in the setting of elevated Lp(a) levels, and may represent a novel therapeutic target for CAVD.
