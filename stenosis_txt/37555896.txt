Title: Endoscopic Ultrasound-Guided Gastro-gastrostomy Using Lumen Apposing Metal Stent for Management of High-Grade Gastric Outlet Obstruction Secondary to Vertical Banded Gastroplasty.

Abstract: Vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) is associated with an increased risk of pouch stricture secondary to narrowing of the banded gastroplasty outlet. We describe a case of a 60-year-old male with stage 4 small cell lung cancer presenting with recurrent gastric outlet obstruction secondary to stenosis at the site of VBG. Given a prior history of failed standard endoscopic maneuvers including balloon dilation and steroid injection, the decision was made to create an endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastro-gastrostomy using lumen opposing metal stent. The patient did well post procedure and was able to tolerate a soft mechanical diet within 24 h. He was subsequently discharged to hospice for his advanced metastatic disease.
