Title: Surgical valvotomy versus balloon dilatation for children with severe aortic valve stenosis: a systematic review.

Abstract: Aim: To evaluate outcomes of interventions for severe aortic valve stenosis (AS), whether it is done by surgical aortic valvotomy (SAV) or balloon aortic dilatation (BAD). Results: Eleven studies with total number of 1733 patients; 743 patients had SAV, while 990 patients received BAD. There was no significant difference in early mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.96, p = 0.86), late mortality (OR: 1.28, p = 0.25), total mortality (OR: 1.10, p = 0.56), and freedom from aortic valve replacement (OR: 1.00, p = 1.00). Reduction of aortic systolic gradient was significantly higher in the SAV group (OR: 2.24, p = 0.00001), and postprocedural AR rate was lower in SAV group (OR: 0.21, p = 0.00001). Conclusion: SAV is associated with better reduction of aortic systolic gradient and lesser post procedural AR which reduce when compared with BAD.
