Title: ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction as a Late Complication of Mild Coronavirus Disease 2019 Infection: A Case Report.

Abstract: Endothelial dysfunction with subsequent thrombosis and, less commonly, vasculitis has been implicated during the active phase of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2) infection. However, less has been described during the recovery phase or as late sequelae. Here, we report a case of acute anterior wall ST-elevation myocardial infarction in a female patient with no medical history of cardiovascular risk factors as a post-infectious complication of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coronary angiography revealed total occlusion of her left anterior descending, right coronary arteries, and tight stenosis in the left circumflex artery. Successful revascularization with a staged percutaneous coronary intervention was achieved. To date, there is not much data regarding the late cardiovascular sequelae of COVID-19 and its possible mechanisms. Prolonged follow-up, even for mild cases of COVID-19, is advised for early diagnosis and treatment of long-term complications of COVID-19.
