Title: Kugel's Artery in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography in a Patient with Left Main Subtotal Stenosis.

Abstract: The artery of Kugel is defined as a rare anatomical variant of the coronary arteries. It consists of an anastomotic connection between the branches of the right coronary artery (RCA) and the left circumflex artery (LCx). In patients with coronary artery occlusion, the presence of this connection bypassing the area of the occluded vessel may be a factor that prevents significant necrosis of a specific area of the myocardium. Most cases are detected by invasive coronary angiography. We present images from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), which documented the existence of Kugel's artery in a 67-year-old patient with subtotal stenosis of the left main artery. The presented images clearly indicate that CCTA can visualize the existing rescue collateral circulation in patients with significant coronary artery disease.
