Title: [Bariatric endoscopy-Possibilities and value in obesity medicine and surgery-A separate special field].

Abstract: Endoscopy has become established as an important component in all preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative areas of bariatric surgery. As guidelines are not yet available, relevant studies and international position papers have been collected in this article. Preoperatively, endoscopy should be performed before sleeve gastrectomy (SG, detection of reflux status) and before bypass procedures (status survey of the postoperatively no longer accessible distal stomach). Routine endoscopic monitoring should be performed 2-3 years after SG and a OAGB (one anastomosis gastric bypass) for recording of the gastroesophageal reflex disease (GERD) status. In the first line complication management of hemorrhage and leakages, endoscopic procedures have prevailed over surgical ones due to more causal therapeutic approaches (except cases of general peritonitis where lavage and drainages are needed). In the treatment of late complications such as dumping, anastomosis dilatation and stenosis, bariatric endoscopy provides versatile, organ-preserving solutions and continues to demonstrate a high degree of innovation. In these postoperative fields of application, especially in the treatment of late complications, specific knowledge of bariatric anatomy and physiology as well as surgical treatment options are required in addition to endoscopic expertise. The special field of bariatric endoscopy has developed and will have an own importance closely linked to the bariatric surgery.
