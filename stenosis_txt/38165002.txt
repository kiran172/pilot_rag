Title: Institutional experience with total pharyngectomy reconstruction: Exploring the role of the salivary bypass tube.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding the effectiveness of salivary bypass tubes during total pharyngectomy reconstruction to prevent pharyngocutaneous fistula or pharyngoesophageal stricture.
METHODS: Our study examined tubed free flap reconstruction outcomes for total pharyngectomy defects over 11â€‰years at a single tertiary referral center. We compared postoperative fistula and stricture rates between two groups: those with salivary bypass tubes inserted during reconstruction and those without.
RESULTS: Among 36 patients, 26 had radial forearm, and 10 had anterolateral thigh free flap reconstruction. 53% received salivary bypass tubes. However, the tubes did not significantly reduce the relative risks of fistula or stricture. Notably, neck dissection during total pharyngectomy was associated with increased fistula incidence. Minor salivary bypass tube-related complications affected 21% of subjects.
CONCLUSION: The role of salivary bypass tubes in total pharyngectomy reconstruction remains uncertain.
