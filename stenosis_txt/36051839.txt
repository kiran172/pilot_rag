Title: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty in neonates: short- and long-term effects and predictors of successful outcome.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) is a common treatment method of aortic valve (AV) stenosis in neonates. Long-term BAV effects are suboptimal, and their predictors are not well acknowledged.
AIM: To identify predictors of suboptimal short- and long-term BAV results.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study group comprised forty-three neonates (8 females; weight 3.34 ±0.56 kg) who underwent BAV between 1998 and 2021. Seventeen patients (39.53%) had critical AV stenosis. AV was bicuspid in 22 patients, tricuspid in 12, unicuspid in 2, and undefined in 7 patients. The mean balloon/annulus ratio was 0.9 ±0.07. Catheterization, clinical, and follow-up data were analysed.
RESULTS: The peak-to-peak gradient decreased from 67.5 ±26.3 to 21.3 ±12.6 mm Hg. Twenty-eight patients (65.1%) had adequate early outcome. Aortic regurgitation (AR) occurred in 13 (30.2%) patients. No predictors of inadequate early outcome were found. Twenty-year survival was 90.7%. Eleven (35.5%) patients underwent reintervention at a median of 12 (1-215) months; BAV in 5 patients, surgical valvuloplasty in 2, Ross operation in 2, AV replacement in 1, and Norwood operation in 1 patient. Fifteen-year freedom from reintervention (FFR) was 48%. Adequate early outcome resulted in higher FFR (71% vs. 22%), and so did no significant AR (60% vs. 30%).
CONCLUSIONS: BAV provides satisfying early results. AR remains a significant aftermath of BAV. Risk factors and procedural techniques improving the outcome of BAV are unclear. Further research is needed to improve FFR.
