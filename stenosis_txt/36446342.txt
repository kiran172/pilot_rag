Title: Association between Anatomical Variations of the Circle of Willis and Covert Vascular Brain Injury in the General Population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The circle of Willis (COW) is a circulatory anastomosis located at the base of the brain. Little is known about the association between covert vascular brain injury and COW configurations in the general population. We explored this relationship in a community-based Chinese sample.
METHODS: A total of 1,055 patients (mean age, 54.8 Â± 8.9 years; 36.0% men) without intracranial arterial stenosis were included in the analysis. Magnetic resonance imaging was performed to evaluate the presence of imaging markers of covert vascular brain injury, including white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), lacunes, cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), enlarged perivascular spaces, and brain atrophy. Magnetic resonance angiography was used to classify the COW configurations according to the completeness, symmetry, and presence of the fetal posterior cerebral artery (FTP). The association between vascular lesions and variations in COW was analyzed.
RESULTS: Among the 1,055 patients, 104 (9.9%) had a complete COW. Completeness correlated with age (p = 0.001). Incomplete COW was positively associated with WMH severity (OR = 2.071; 95% CI, 1.004-4.270) and CMB presence (OR = 1.542; 95% CI, 1.012-2.348), independent of age and sex. The presence of FTP was associated with lacunes (OR = 1.878; 95% CI, 1.069-3.298), more severe WMHs (OR = 1.739; 95% CI, 1.064-2.842), and less severe enlarged perivascular spaces (OR = 0.562; 95% CI, 0.346-0.915).
CONCLUSIONS: COW configuration was significantly related to various covert vascular brain injuries.
