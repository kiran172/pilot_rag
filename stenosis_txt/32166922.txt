Title: Serial voiding urosonography in posterior urethral valve diagnosis and management in pediatric patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Report our experience with the use of contrast-enhanced serial voiding urosonography (SVU) for posterior urethral valve (PUV) patient diagnosis and management.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Descriptive retrospective study in 0- to 14-year-old patients with suspected PUV at SVU performed as a first contrast-enhanced urinary tract test with subsequent cystoscopic study. Variables were analyzed using SPSSv22.
RESULTS: 18 patients were studied (median age: 6 months). Most patients (15) presented posterior urethral dilatation (mean diameter: 9.56 mm) and a >2 mm gap between proximal and distal urethra. 13 cases had bladder thickening and 9 had VUR. 15 PUV cases, 1 case of distal urethral mucocele, and 1 case of bladder diverticulum obstructing the urethra were diagnosed. Complete PUV resection was performed in 10 patients (66.6%) at the first cystoscopy. The control SVU detected one case of recurrence due to persistence of posterior urethral dilatation. The recurrence case and the 5 incomplete resection cases were treated with a second cystoscopy and resection. The youngest patients required a third resection and cutting balloon dilatation due to residual stenosis. Mean creatinine levels at diagnosis were 0.28 mg/dl.
CONCLUSIONS: Serial voiding urosonography (SVU) is a useful complementary test in pediatric patients with posterior urethral valve. Its dynamic nature and its advantages - absence of irradiation, safety, and high sensitivity - make it an ideal imaging test for PUV diagnosis and follow-up.
