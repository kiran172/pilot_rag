Title: Budd-Chiari Syndrome during Long-term Follow-up after Allogeneic Umbilical Cord Blood Transplantation.

Abstract: A series of abdominal computed tomography scans of an asymptomatic 40-year-old woman with a history of umbilical cord blood transplantation (CBT) for leukemia at 19 years old revealed the long-term gradual development of a right hepatic vein thrombus and stenosis of the inferior vena cava, leading to a diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. The Budd-Chiari syndrome in this case might have been influenced by the patient's history of multiple liver abscesses after CBT and associated thrombus formation, in addition to the hormone replacement therapy with estradiol and dydrogesterone she was taking. This case provides insight into the development of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
