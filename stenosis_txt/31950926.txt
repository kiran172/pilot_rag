Title: Spontaneous renal pelvic perforation in a patient with advanced lung cancer receiving avastin (bevacizumab). About a case.

Abstract: Bevacizumab is a monoclonalantibody used as a targeted therapy in blocking vascularendothelial growth factor in different types of oncologicaland non-oncological diseases. It has demonstratedsurvival benefits in the treatment of many types of malignanttumors, including lung cancer. As all drugs have adverseeffects, one of the most uncommon being gastrointestinalperforation and few cases of ureteral stenosis. However,they do not mention or describe the perforation of segmentsof the urinary tract. OBJECTIVE: To describe renal pelvic perforation as an adverseeffect to the use of Bevacizumab. CASE DESCRIPTION: 67-year-old male patient with metastaticlung cancer being treated with Bevacizumab whohas perforation of the renal pelvis is presented. A pyelogramwas performed showing contrast extravasation at theleft renal pelvis and a double J catheter was placed, witha satisfactory clinical course, and tomographic control at 1month without evidence of extravasation of contrast, withdrawingdouble catheter J. CONCLUSION: Renal pelvic perforation secondary toBevacizumab is infrequent, but it must be taken into accountin patients treated with this drug.
