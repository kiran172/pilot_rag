Title: Mosaic Trisomy 16 Associated with Left Lung Agenesis, Abnormal Left Arm, and Right Pulmonary Artery Stenosis: Expanding the Phenotype and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Trisomy 16 is the most common autosomal trisomy found in spontaneous abortions with mosaic versions seen in survivors. However, surviving children have multiple congenital defects and are at risk of growth and developmental delay. We report an additional case of mosaic trisomy 16 diagnosed by amniocentesis and confirmed after birth. Our patient is the first documented case of living mosaic trisomy 16 with the malformation constellation of lung agenesis, left pulmonary artery agenesis, congenital heart defects, and ipsilateral radial ray and limb abnormalities, expanding the phenotype of this rare condition. Additionally, this individual's unique combination of lung and cardiac defects caused morbidities that were challenging to manage and complicated family counseling as well.
