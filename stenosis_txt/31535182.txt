Title: Development of a Ductal Aneurysm in a Patient with Williams Syndrome, and Subsequent Interventional Closure.

Abstract: Whilst stenosis of systemic and pulmonary arteries in Williams syndrome is frequently described, aneurysm formation is uncommon. We provide the first description of a Williams patient with development of an aneurysm of the arterial duct. This aneurysm developed concomitantly with supravalvar aortic, and peripheral pulmonary stenosis. The duct was closed interventionally to reduce the risk of rupture.
