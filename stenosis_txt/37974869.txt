Title: Tracheostoma Closure Technique Using Three Local Flaps.

Abstract: When a tracheostoma is no longer needed, the opening normally closes spontaneously after cannula removal, but some cases require tracheostoma closure. This procedure has been well described, but must be performed in such a way as to minimize its invasiveness and complications while securing a high closure rate. Our procedure for conducting tracheostoma closure technique involves the creation of two hinge flaps and one cover flap to close the tracheostomy opening. We reviewed the medical records of 23 patients (12 men, 11 women; mean age 60.0 SD19.7 years) who underwent tracheostoma closure technique between 2001 and 2019. Surgery was indicated for patients in whom closure had not occurred after conservative monitoring for ≥ 2 months following cannula removal. The surgical procedure began by raising two hinge flaps on either side of the tracheostomy opening, turning the skin surface to the luminal side to form the anterior tracheal wall. Rather than a single layer of skin, multiple skin layers were sutured together to prevent air leakage from between hinge flaps. A further cover flap was produced to cover the anterior tracheal wall, closing the tracheostomy opening. Postoperatively, the tracheal lumen was observed via fiberscopy. No stenosis of the tracheal lumen occurred in any patients, and the tracheocutaneous fistula was successfully closed in all cases. Tracheostoma closure technique using hinge flaps to reconstruct the anterior tracheal wall and a cover flap as a skin flap to cover the skin defect appears useful for patients with failure of spontaneous tracheocutaneous fistula closure.
