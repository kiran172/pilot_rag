Title: Nuss procedure for the treatment of pectus excavatum with dyspnea following oropharyngeal cancer surgery: a case report.

Abstract: Pectus excavatum (PE) causes cardiopulmonary dysfunction depending on the degree and form of the depression. The patient was a 74-year-old woman with a history of PE. Fourteen years ago, a total glossolaryngectomy was performed for oropharyngeal cancer. Two years later, the patient gradually experienced difficulty in breathing. Computed tomography (CT) revealed severe PE and right main bronchial stenosis. We performed a Nuss procedure for PE repair to surgically release the stenosis of the right main bronchus. Postoperative chest CT showed improvement in the sternal depression and right main bronchial stenosis. Furthermore, shortness of breath was relieved postoperatively. Oropharyngeal cancer surgery may cause tracheal support disruption, leading to leftward shift and severe stenosis of the right main bronchus due to sternum depression. This is an important report regarding respiratory distress caused by a combination of PE and post-oropharyngeal cancer surgery.
