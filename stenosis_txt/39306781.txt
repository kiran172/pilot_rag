Title: Congenital Nasal Pyriform Aperture Stenosis and the Significance of McGovern Nipple.

Abstract: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is a rare but potentially life-threatening cause of upper airway obstruction in infants. It was first described in 1988 and 1989 in the radiology and otolaryngology literature. Congenital airway obstruction affects up to 1 in 5,000 infants, and many of these obstructions result from choanal atresia. CNPAS is estimated to occur 1 in 25,000 live births. This case report describes a neonate with acute respiratory distress and obstructive breathing pattern relieved by opening her oral airway and maintained with the McGovern nipple decreasing ventilator days during hospitalization with viral bronchiolitis.
