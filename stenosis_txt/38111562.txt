Title: Use of the gun-sight technique to create a parallel transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt.

Abstract: A parallel shunt (PS) is often necessary to regain portal decompression in a dysfunctional transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Here, we successfully utilized the gun-sight technique to create a PS. An 81-year-old male with decompensated NASH cirrhosis and recent TIPS placement presents with recurrent ascites and pleural effusions in the setting of a persistent portosystemic gradient. Due to a lack of access to endovascular ultrasound and complex patient anatomy, a gun-site technique was approached to create a PS (left portal vein [PV] to left hepatic vein [HV]). After the right HV and existing TIPS were accessed via the right internal jugular vein access, the left HV was accessed. Following a left portal venogram, 10 mm snares were placed into the left HV and the left PV. An 18-gauge needle was then fluoroscopically placed through and through both snares. A 0.035 Glidewire was snared with the help of both snares, establishing access from the left HV via the left PV to the right PV. After serial dilation, a roadrunner wire and catheter were placed into the main PV and superior mesenteric vein, followed by stent dilation. Post-TIPS portal venogram showed prompt flow of contrast from the main PV to the right atrium without any stenosis through both TIPS stents in the left and right PVs. Initial and postprocedural TIPS gradients were 24 mm Hg and 6 mm Hg, respectively. Gun-site technique is a valuable technique in creating a parallel TIPS shunt.
