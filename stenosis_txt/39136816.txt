Title: Giant right and left atrium: spectrum of rheumatic triple valve disease (double hit with double impact): a case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) continues to pose a significant burden on global health, particularly in socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. We present the case of a 38-year-old woman with severe multivalvular RHD and giant atria, highlighting the challenges and complexities of managing this condition.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented with progressively worsening dyspnoea, signs of right heart failure, and severe valvular abnormalities. Diagnostic evaluations revealed severe mixed mitral valve disease in the form of mitral stenosis and regurgitation, along with involvement of the aortic and tricuspid valves, leading to significant enlargement of both atria. Despite facing socioeconomic constraints and poor adherence to treatment, the patient underwent successful surgical intervention, resulting in remarkable symptomatic improvement.
CONCLUSIONS: Through this case, we emphasise the importance of early detection, comprehensive management strategies, and multidisciplinary care in addressing the complexities of RHD. Despite the challenges posed by socioeconomic disparities, positive outcomes can be achieved with timely diagnosis and appropriate intervention. This case underscores the need for targeted efforts to improve access to healthcare resources and reduce the global burden of RHD.
