Title: In Situ Transesophageal Echocardiography During Electrical Cardioversion in Patients With Atrial Fibrillation-Safety and Echocardiographic Findings.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) can reliably detect left atrial (LA) and LA appendage (LAA) thrombus in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) before electrical cardioversion (ECV). However, evaluating cardiac and valve function pre-ECV can be challenging due to the increased and irregular heart rate. Additionally, post-ECV atrial stunning increases the risk of LAA thrombosis. Therefore, post-ECV TEE may allow for useful appendage, ventricular, and valve function assessment. However, the safety and usefulness of leaving the TEE probe in situ during ECV for post-ECV cardiac evaluation in clinical practice have not been previously evaluated.
METHODS: We analyzed 37 out of 86 consecutive patients who had the TEE probe left in situ, for clinical reasons, during ECV by a single operator between February 20, 2019, and January 3, 2023. We examined changes in left ventricular (LV) function, dynamic changes in valvular regurgitation, electromechanical coupling of the left atrium, and qualitative spontaneous echo contrast. We also assessed the presence of any complications related to the periprocedural TEE exam.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 74 ± 9.65 years, and 29 (78%) were male. The periprocedural TEE time ranged from 7 to 55 minutes, with an average of 20.78 minutes. Immediately after ECV and restoration of normal sinus rhythm, there was an improvement in LV ejection fraction (47% ± 11.9% vs 40% ± 15.8%; P = .035). There was also a reduction in baseline mitral regurgitation of greater than moderate degree. However, spontaneous echo contrast worsened in the LAA in 11 (31.4%) patients. Additionally, 1 patient developed a new LAA thrombus, and 24 patients (72%) had evidence of electromechanical coupling with Doppler evidence of LA contraction. Clinically significant degenerative aortic and mitral stenosis were identified in 8% and mild or greater aortic regurgitation in 8% of patients post-ECV. No procedural complications were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In situ TEE before, during, and after ECV is safe and provides useful clinical information regarding immediate cardiac changes after ECV, with diagnostic and therapeutic implications.
