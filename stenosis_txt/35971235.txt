Title: Double root translocation: Early experience on performance of translocated aortic and pulmonary root.

Abstract: AIM: Transposition of great arteries with ventricular septal defect and pulmonary stenosis is a complex congenital cardiac malformation with varied treatment options. Double root translocation is one of the described techniques with several advantages over other techniques. Our goal of this study is to report our early experiences on the performance of translocated aortic and pulmonary root.
METHODS: From 2016 to 2019, a total of 12 patients (seven boys and five girls) aged from one year to three years underwent double root translocation. All our patients were diagnosed with dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA)/double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), ventricular septal defect (VSD), and pulmonary stenosis (PS). One patient (8.33%) presented with (IL 2R CX), remaining 11 patients (91.66%) had (IL CXâ€‰2R) as their coronary pattern. Mean follow-up period was two years (1-3 years).
RESULTS: At six months follow up, one patient died due to severe MR, one patient had severe TR and was taken back for surgery after two weeks post-surgery. Three patients had trivial aortic regurgitation (AR) and nine had no AR, two patients had trivial mitral regurgitation (MR) and 10 had no MR 11 patients had post-operative sinus rhythm and were in NYHA class 1. One patient with a complete heart block was supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenator followed by tracheostomy. Redo TV repair was done in one patient. Peritoneal dialysis was accomplished in two patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Double root translocation is a good alternative surgical treatment for TGA/DORV, VSD, and PS, where the pulmonary valve is small, but the leaflets are usable. Although the operation is technically demanding, our early follow-up on translocated root performance shows promising outcomes.
