Title: Drug-coated balloon angioplasty for the treatment of intracranial arterial stenosis in a young stroke patient: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial arterial narrowing is a significant factor leading to brief episodes of reduced blood flow to the brain, known as transient ischemic attacks, or full-blown strokes. While atherosclerosis is commonly associated with intracranial arterial narrowing, it is frequently of a non-atherosclerotic nature in younger patients.
CASE SUMMARY: Here, we present the case of a young stroke patient with narrowing of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), characterized as non-atherosclerotic lesions, who experienced an ischemic stroke despite receiving standard drug therapy. The patient underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to assess the entire network of blood vessels in the brain, revealing significant narrowing (approximately 80%) in the M1 segment of the right MCA. Subsequently, the patient underwent Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty to treat the stenosis in the right MCA's M1 segment. Follow-up DSA confirmed the resolution of stenosis in this segment. Although the remaining branches showed satisfactory blood flow, the vessel wall exhibited irregularities. A review of DSA conducted six months later showed no evident stenosis in the right MCA, with a smooth vessel wall.
CONCLUSION: The use of drug-coated balloon angioplasty demonstrated favorable outcomes in repairing and reshaping the blood vessel wall in young patients. Therefore, it may be considered a promising treatment option for similar cases.
