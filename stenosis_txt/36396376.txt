Title: [Current status and the necessity for enterostomy training: Results of a national survey in China].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the perceptions, attitudes, and surgical strategies of Chinese surgeons, toward stoma management. Methods: We conducted a nationwide, cross-sectional, questionnaire-based survey among individuals working at relevant departments in any tier of hospitals, including general surgery, gastrointestinal surgery, surgical oncology, emergency, and others, that was involved in managing enterostomies. We required that participants be senior surgeons who had participated in performing enterostomy surgery. The questionnaire consisted of five dimensions: personnel qualification and training, attitude toward ostomy complications, preoperative siting, the process of acquiring ostomy-related surgical skills, and awareness and adoption of relevant techniques. Descriptive statistical analysis was performed. Results: From July 2021 to July 2022, we sent 488 questionnaires through a WeChat link or two-dimensional barcode. We received 467 (95.7%) responses from 196 hospitals in 26 provinces. Among the respondents, 426 (91.2%) were from tertiary hospitals, the departments of which comprised general surgery (130, 27.8%), gastrointestinal surgery (210, 45.0%), surgical oncology (116, 24.8%), and other departments (11, 2.4%). Senior surgeons accounted for 311(66.6%) of the participants. We found that: (1) mentorship by senior surgeons was the primary source of knowledge about ostomies (83.3%, 389/467), followed by mentorship by others and surgical atlases (44.8%, 209/467), and self-education (42.0%, 196/467). (2) Concerns about correlations between complications and surgical procedures that were believed to be "closely" or "probably" related to complications (79.0%, 369/467) were expressed by 99.4% (464/467) of the surgeons. Stenosis and intestinal obstruction requiring unplanned surgery were not uncommon (61.0%, 285/467). Of the listed complications, 46.7% (218/467) were believed to be related to surgical procedures and 79.0% (369/467) avoidable. Only 58.7% (274/467) of surgeons had participated in training and discussion of stoma complications whereas 99.1% (463/467) believed that joint training and discussions between surgeons and enterostomal therapists were necessary. (3) The main reasons for creation of stomas that were not consistent with prior siting included: stoma site marked preoperatively not a suitable trocar site (56.1%, 262/467), defunctioning stoma marking according to standards for permanent stomas (50.7%, 237/467), and inappropriate marking (43.3%, 202/467). (4) The rate of awareness of relevant procedures was generally high; however, it was less than 75% for stoma creation by circular stapler (64.1%, 257/401) and parastomal drainage (44.1%, 177/401). Eversion suture of mucosa and supporting rods were utilized in 65.6% (263/401) and 56.4% (226/401), respectively. Peritoneum (or posterior rectus abdominis sheath) (68.3%, 274/401), anterior rectus abdominis sheath (54.4%, 218/401), and skin (80.6%, 323/401) were the most commonly used tissues for fixation and suture layers of defunctioning and permanent stomas. However, closure of subcutaneous tissue was controversial, suturing being advocated by 26.7% (107/401) and 32.7% (131/401) of surgeons, respectively. Complications were considered to depend mainly on technical skills rather than the amount of suturing by 81.5% (327/401) of the participating surgeons. Conclusions: The complications of stoma surgery are related to the awareness and technical skills of surgeons, indicating there are insufficient training, education, management, and research. Standardization of enterostomy technical strategies and stoma management are therefore imperative.
