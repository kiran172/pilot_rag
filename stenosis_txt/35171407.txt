Title: Advanced Imaging of the Biliary System and Pancreas.

Abstract: Despite advances in noninvasive techniques for imaging the pancreaticobiliary system, several disease processes including indeterminate biliary strictures as well as neuroendocrine tumors, inflammatory pseudotumors, and complex cysts of the pancreas remain difficult to characterize. New endoscopic imaging technologies have emerged to address these challenges. Cholangioscopy and intraductal ultrasound (IDUS) are powerful tools to characterize subtle biliary concretions and strictures. Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (CLE) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are emerging approaches for the most difficult biliary lesions. Contrast harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CH-EUS), elastography, and 3D-EUS are improving the approach to subtle pancreatic lesions, particularly in the context of indeterminate tissue sampling. Pancreatoscopy, pancreatic IDUS, and intracystic CLE hold promise to further improve the assessment of pancreatic cysts. We aim to comprehensively review the emerging clinical evidence for these innovative endoscopic imaging techniques.
