Title: Situs inversus with dextrocardia and transposition of great arteries.

Abstract: Transposition of the great arteries with left ventricle outflow tract obstruction in combination with situs inversus totalis and dextrocardia is a very rare anomaly and carries high morbidity and mortality. Only few cases have been reported with this anomaly. We describe a 21-day of infant girl with transposition of the great arteries and mirror image dextrocardia and pulmonary stenosis who underwent successful neonatal arterial switch operation and left ventricle outflow tract obstruction resection following PDA stent implantation.
