Title: Prognostic Impact of Myocardial Extracellular Volume Fraction Assessment Using Dual-Energy Computed Tomography in Patients Treated With Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Background Myocardial extracellular volume fraction (ECV), measured by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, is a useful prognostic marker for patients who have undergone aortic valve replacement (AVR) for aortic stenosis. However, the prognostic significance of ECV measurements based on computed tomography (CT) is unclear. This study evaluated the association between ECV measured with dual-energy CT and clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter or surgical AVR. Methods and Results We retrospectively enrolled 95 consecutive patients (age, 84.0±5.0 years; 75% women) with severe aortic stenosis who underwent preprocedural CT for transcatheter AVR planning. ECV was measured using iodine density images obtained by delayed enhancement dual-energy CT. The primary end point was a composite outcome of all-cause death and hospitalization for heart failure after AVR. The mean ECV measured with CT was 28.1±3.8%. During a median follow-up of 2.6 years, 22 composite outcomes were observed, including 15 all-cause deaths and 11 hospitalizations for heart failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, the high ECV group (≥27.8% [median value]) had significantly higher rates of composite outcomes than the low ECV group (&lt;27.8%) (log-rank test, P=0.012). ECV was the only independent predictor of adverse outcomes on multivariable Cox regression analysis (hazards ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.10‒1.41; P&lt;0.001). Conclusions Myocardial ECV measured with dual-energy CT in patients who underwent aortic valve intervention was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes after AVR.
