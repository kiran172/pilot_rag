Title: Multimodality imaging of left ventricular apical pseudoaneurysm after apical approach transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Left ventricular pseudoaneurysm formation is a rare complication of transapical approach transcatheter aortic valve replacement. It can cause chest pain and shortness of breath or remain asymptomatic. Mortality rate is high, and therefore, timely diagnosis and management are essential. Different imaging modalities can provide anatomic or functional information and are essential for the primary diagnosis or during follow-up.
