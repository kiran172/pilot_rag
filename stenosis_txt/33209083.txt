Title: Differential Diagnosis of Ischemic Vertigo by Optical Coherence Tomography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the differences in the mean retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients with early stage central vertigo with or without vertebrobasilar stenosis detected by Doppler ultrasound.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients with ischemic vertigo and 50 healthy individuals were included in the study. The distinction between central and peripheral vertigo was determined by physical and neurological examinations and the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. For all patients, the mean RNFL thickness was determined using OCT performed by 2 independent ophthalmologists.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of age and sex distribution (p>0.05). On average, in superior, inferior, and temporal quadrants, there was a statistically significant difference between the control and patient groups (p<0.001).
CONCLUSION: The retina may be affected in patients with ischemic vertigo because of atherosclerotic ischemic lesions in the carotid and vertebral arteries. Neuroimaging methods and OCT were evaluated together to develop a new diagnostic approach. With OCT, which is a non-invasive method, early and more objective differential diagnosis will be possible.
