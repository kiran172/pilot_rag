Title: Supporting Breastfeeding in Complex Pediatric Otolaryngology Dyads: Clinical Pathway With Illustrative Case Series.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The benefits of breastfeeding are well established, yet complex infants are less frequently supported to feed direct or pumped breastmilk. This article aims to provide an algorithm to support complex infants in meeting breastfeeding goals.
METHODS: Two cases are presented to illustrate the breastfeeding support pathway. Each involves early identification of motivated caregivers, consultation of allied health, and assessment of swallowing safety with modification of position or route as appropriate.
RESULTS: Two infants presented herein successfully continued to receive breastmilk despite airway complexity-1 with oral aversion secondary to prolonged nil per os period in the setting of tracheoesophageal fistula, and 1 with a tracheostomy secondary to subglottic stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: It is both possible and imperative to support complex infants in continuing to breastfeed, either directly or via the safest possible route, for the benefits to both members of the dyad.
