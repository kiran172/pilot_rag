Title: Pharyngeal reconstruction using a U-shaped pectoralis major myocutaneous flap: an effective technique that should not be forgotten.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Although free tissue transfer is thought the best option for head and neck reconstruction, the pectoralis major myocutaneous flap (PMMCF) remains an important alternative method. The aim of this study was to assess the use of the PMMCF with the prevertebral fascia to close a pharyngeal defect.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study of 30 patients who underwent circumferential pharyngeal defect reconstruction with a U-shaped PMMCF from 2009 to 2018. The flap was primarily used to reconstruct defects after tumor extirpation.
RESULTS: One patient (3.3%) died of an acute myocardial infarction within 24 h of the operation. Six cases (20.0%) developed a pharyngocutaneous fistula; one of them required debridement, while the others spontaneously healed with conservative treatment. Seven cases (23.3%) developed tracheal stomal stenosis. Twenty-four (80.0%) of these cases could eat a regular diet, while the other five cases needed tube feeding.
CONCLUSION: In patients with late-stage laryngopharyngeal cancer, reconstructing circumferential pharyngeal defects with the U-shaped PMMCF is an expedient alternative to free tissue transfer.
