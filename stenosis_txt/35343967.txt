Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy-Assisted Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: During the last decade, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved as a well-established therapy for aging patients suffering from symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. This is also reflected in the recently updated international guidelines on managing patients with valvular heart disease. A transfemoral (TF) TAVI approach has proven superior to alternative access strategies. With the introduction of intravascular lithotripsy (IVL), patients with calcified iliofemoral vascular disease and borderline intraluminal diameters have also become candidates for percutaneous TF-TAVI. Moreover, IVL reduces the risk of major vascular complications by modifying the superficial and deep vascular calcium, thereby changing the vessel compliance and controlling luminal expansion. In this way, IVL has shown to safely facilitate TF delivery of TAVI devices in patients with calcified peripheral artery disease. The present article aims to provide a detailed step-by-step description on how to perform IVL-assisted TF-TAVI safely and efficiently. Furthermore, a literature review on the outcomes obtained with this technology is included, along with a concise discussion on this unique TAVI approach.
