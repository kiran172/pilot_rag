Title: Prevalence of RNF213 rs112735431 Genetic Polymorphism in Non-Cardioembolic Ischemic Cerebrovascular Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study in Thai Patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Moyamoya disease (MMD) and non-MMD intracranial cerebral artery stenosis (ICAS) have been linked to the RNF213 rs112735431 gene in Korean and Japanese populations. This cross-sectional study investigates the prevalence of the RNF213 rs112735431 gene in non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke (NCIS) among Thai patients.
METHODS: A cross-sectional investigation was conducted on patients aged 18 years or older admitted to King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between June 2015 and March 2016 with acute NCIS. ICAS and extracranial carotid artery stenosis (ECAS) were assessed through computer tomography angiography or magnetic resonance angiography. Blood samples were collected, and Sanger sequencing was performed.
RESULTS: Among 234 acute NCIS cases, 113 exhibited ICAS, 12 had ECAS, 20 had both, and 89 had neither. The RNF213 rs112735431 gene variant was detected in 2 patients, both heterozygous A/G. The frequency of the RNF213 rs112735431 variant was 0.9% (2/234; 95% CI: 0-2.1%) in acute NCIS patients and 1.8% (2/113; 95% CI: 0-4.2%) in ICAS. All individuals with the RNF213 variant were males with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, and ICAS, without a family history of ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSION: This study reveals that the RNF213 rs112735431 gene variant is uncommon among Thai NCIS patients, suggesting a discrepancy in the prevalence of this genetic variation between Thai and other Eastern Asian populations.
