Title: Carotid and Renal Vascular Disease.

Abstract: This article review covers carotid artery disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and atherosclerotic renal artery disease. It overviews each condition's clinical presentation, diagnosis, medical management, and interventional approach. Carotid artery disease is characterized by hemispheric and neuropsychological manifestations, which can help detect this condition. Screening for carotid artery stenosis is recommended in high-risk individuals and can be performed using different methods, with carotid duplex ultrasonography being the preferred option. Carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting are indicated based on specific criteria and patient characteristics. An abdominal aortic aneurysm is often asymptomatic, but abdominal, back, or flank pain may sometimes be present. Ultrasonography is an effective method for screening and monitoring abdominal aortic aneurysms, with high sensitivity and specificity. Smoking cessation is a crucial intervention for preventing further enlargement of small aortic aneurysms. Repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm is recommended based on the aneurysm size, growth rate, and the presence of symptoms. Endovascular repair is preferred when suitable anatomy is present. Atherosclerotic renal artery disease is associated with resistant hypertension, renal failure, and occasionally pulmonary edema. Doppler ultrasonography is a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting it, while the renal resistive index provides additional insights into disease severity and treatment response. Revascularization is not routinely recommended for atherosclerotic renal artery disease, but it may be considered in specific cases, such as renal arterial fibromuscular dysplasia or unexplained congestive heart failure.
