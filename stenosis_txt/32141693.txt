Title: Effects of pericardial tamponade on the hemodynamics of aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Compressive pericardial physiology (i.e., cardiac tamponade) reduces ventricular chamber volume/filling and cardiac output, which exacerbates coexisting hemodynamic derangements. In this hemodynamic rounds, we demonstrate the interaction of two hemodynamic conditions in one patient with acute pericardial tamponade in the setting of aortic stenosis (AS). Simultaneous pressures across the aortic valve before and after relief of cardiac tamponade demonstrate an acute and uncommon improvement in the hemodynamics of AS.
