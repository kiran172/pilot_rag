Title: Comparative analysis of stenting for carotid web and atherosclerotic disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid Web (CaW) is an increasingly recognized etiology of ischemic stroke, and has been shown to be amenable to endovascular stenting. The technical complexity of stenting for CaW may be lower than for carotid atherosclerotic disease (CAD). We aimed to assess procedural characteristics of stenting for CaW as compared to CAD.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of consecutive patients at a single comprehensive stroke center from 2014 to 2021, who had undergone elective endovascular stent placement for symptomatic CAD or CaW.
RESULTS: In total, 118 patients underwent elective stent placement following ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack; 88 patients had CAD and 30 patients had CaW. CAD patients were older (63.2 vs 51.2 years, p &lt; 0.001), less likely to be female (28.4% vs 73.3%, p &lt; 0.001), and more likely to have pre-existing vascular risk factors. Procedure time (73.0 vs 57.5 min, p = 0.007), radiation exposure (1482 vs 1125 milliGray, p = 0.03), filter time (24 vs 14 min, p = 0.04), and use of pre-stent (68.2% vs 0%, p &lt; 0.001) and post-stent (34.1% vs 3.3%, p &lt; 0.001) balloon angioplasty were higher in CAD cases. There was no significant difference between groups in the rate of periprocedural complications such as hypotension, use of vasopressors, or bradycardia. Recurrent stroke/TIA was reported in five CAD patients and 0 CaW patients by the end of the follow-up period (8.3% vs 0%, p = 0.12). In-stent restenosis was detected in seven CAD patients and 0 CaW patients (10.1% vs 0%, p = 0.09) at a median follow-up of 4 vs 16 months (p = 0.01), respectively. Periprocedural intracranial hemorrhage was not observed in either group.
CONCLUSION: Stenting for CaW was found to be technically simpler than CAD and not to confer increased risk of baroreceptor dysregulation. Intimal hyperplasia was uncommon in CaW cases.
