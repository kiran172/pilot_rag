Title: Heart Team Approach for Cardiogenic Shock Management in Pregnancy Complicated by Mechanical Mitral Valve Thrombosis.

Abstract: A 27-year-old pregnant woman at 24 weeks of gestation was admitted with cardiogenic shock due to mechanical mitral valve thrombosis. Following discussion with the heart team, thrombolysis was achieved with tissue plasminogen activator therapy followed by heparin infusion. Ultimately, the patient required mitral valve replacement for persistently elevated gradients.
