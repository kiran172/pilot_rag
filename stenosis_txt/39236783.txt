Title: Relationship between triglyceride-glucose index and carotid artery plaques in ischemic stroke patients: Based on blood pressure status, sex, and age.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have shown that the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is a reliable substitute marker for insulin resistance. Nevertheless, its correlation with carotid artery plaques (CAPs) among patients with ischemic stroke (IS) remains to be elucidated.
METHODS: 9248 IS patients hospitalized at the First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine were grouped according to the quartiles of TyG index. Patients were further stratified by blood pressure status, sex, age and hypertension control status. Employing logistic regression to examine the connection between the TyG index and CAPs.Additionally, analyzing the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the predictive value of the TyG index for CAPs.
RESULTS: Participants with an elevated TyG index had an increased prevalence of CAPs. The TyG index was positively correlated with CAPs (OR: 1.26, CI: 1.14-1.40, P<0.001). Compared with normal blood pressure and prehypertensive patients, the TyG index was markedly correlated with CAPs among hypertensive patients (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.15-1.44, P<0.001). Females had a higher OR value than males(OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.11-1.54, P=0.001 versus OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.09-1.41, P=0.001). Older patients (>60 years) had a higher OR value than their middle-aged counterparts (â‰¤60 years) (OR: 1.35; 95% CI: 1.16-1.58, P<0.001 versus OR: 1.20; 95% CI: 1.05-1.37, P=0.007). Patients with poorly-controlled hypertension had a higher OR value than patients with well-controlled hypertension(OR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.14-1.63, P=0.001 versus OR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.07-1.44, P=0.003). After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) value in the overall population, sex-stratified group, hypertensive patients and hypertension control status-stratified group were all above 0.7 (P<0.01), demonstrating good forecasting capability.
CONCLUSIONS: In IS patients, the TyG index was significantly associated with CAPs. Additionally, this correlation was more pronounced in hypertensive patients, females, older individuals and patients with poorly-controlled hypertension.
