Title: Coronary artery disease in older adults with congenital heart defects: risk factors and pharmacotherapy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: With advancing age, adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD) are at a higher risk of developing atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD).
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to determine the prevalence of CAD, its risk factors, and use of guideline‑directed pharmacotherapy among older patients with ACHD.  Patients and methods: We studied all ACHD patients aged 60 years or older hospitalized in our department between the years 2013 and 2020. CAD was defined as a history of acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization, or more than 50% diameter stenosis on coronary angiography. Data regarding the underlying heart defect, prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors, and drug prescriptions were collected.
RESULTS: A total of 198 patients with known coronary artery status (mean [SD] age, 66.2 [5.3] years; 43.3% men) were included in the analysis. Of them, 54 (27.3%) had CAD. The individuals with CAD were more often men, and they were more likely to have a mild heart defect, dyslipidemia, and a history of hypertension and tobacco use. Multivariable analysis showed that male sex (P = 0.001), dyslipidemia (P = 0.003), and hypertension (P = 0.04) were positive independent predictors of CAD, whereas overweight / obesity was identified as a negative independent predictor (P = 0.04). The proportion of CAD patients on antiplatelet and / or anticoagulant drugs was 92.6%. β‑Blockers were prescribed to 87% of the patients, and a lipid‑lowering agent to 96% of the study population.
CONCLUSIONS: CAD is common in older patients with ACHD. Our results underline the importance of identification and treatment of modifiable CAD risk factors in individuals with ACHD. The obesity paradox might also play a role in this population. The rate of guideline‑recommended pharmacotherapy implementation seems to be satisfactory.
