Title: [Analysis of echocardiographic features and postnatal management of fetal pulmonary valve stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the echocardiographic features, consistency of diagnosis between fetal and postnatal periods and postnatal clinical outcomes of fetal pulmonary valve stenosis (PS) with different degrees. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study comprising 108 cases of fetal PS diagnosed during the fetal period and followed up postnatally at Xinhua Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine from November 2012 to February 2023. Echocardiographic characteristics, including morphological and hemodynamic features were collected for all fetuses who were then were followed up to at least 6 months after birth. One-way analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to compare the differences in the echocardiographic features among fetuses with different degrees of PS. Subsequently, McNemar test was used to assess the consistency of diagnosis between the fetal and postnatal periods. Furthermore, Logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the risk factors for neonatal intervention in fetuses with moderate PS and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to ascertain the optimal cut-off value for continuous variables. Results: The age of the mothers of the 108 fetuses at the initial assessment was (30.8±4.0) years, and the gestational age was 26.5 (24.6, 30.0) weeks. The fetuses were categorized into mild (17 cases), moderate (49 cases), and severe groups (42 cases) based on the initial echocardiographic features. Mild PS was characterized by valve thickening and hyperechogenicity combined with systolic flow acceleration or dilation of main pulmonary artery. Moderate PS exhibited both restricted valve motion and a colorful blood flow pattern at the valve orifice. The peak flow velocities of fetuses with moderate and critical PS were notably higher than those in the mild group ((2.66±0.86) and (2.77±1.30) vs. (1.43±0.59)m/s, F=14.52, P&lt;0.001). In critical PS, all cases showed retrograde ductal flow, with a significantly higher proportion of a small right ventricle compared to the mild and moderate PS (42.9% (18/42) vs. 0 and 2.0% (1/49), χ2=31.73, P&lt;0.001). The proportion of severe tricuspid regurgitation was also higher (35.7% (15/42) vs. 0 and 10.2% (5/49), χ2=36.94, P&lt;0.001). Compared to mild and severe PS, the consistency of diagnosis between fetal and postnatal periods in moderate PS was lower (40.8% (20/49) vs.13/17 and 80.3% (35/42), χ2=12.45, P=0.006). The systolic flow velocity was identified as an independent risk factor for neonatal intervention in fetuses with moderate PS (OR=7.21, 95%CI2.11-24.62). A flow velocity of ≥2.18 m/s in second trimester and ≥3.15 m/s in third trimester indicated the necessity of neonatal intervention for fetal moderate PS. Among the 108 fetuses, 68 underwent surgical intervention and all survived. Additionally, 39 fetuses were regularly followed up. A sole non-surgical fatality occurred, leading to a 6-month survival rate of 99.1% (107/108). Conclusions: Various degrees of fetal PS demonstrate distinctive morphological and hemodynamic alterations in echocardiography. The disparity in severity between the postnatal and fetal stages requires ongoing monitoring for fetal PS. The prognosis for fetal PS is generally favorable.
