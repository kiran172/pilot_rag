Title: [Cancer Therapy with Cell Sheets].

Abstract: We have developed cell sheet-based regenerative medicine, in which cell sheets are fabricated with temperature-responsive culture surfaces. We succeeded in clinical translation and large animal model experiments of cell sheet-based regenerative medicine to treat various complications of cancer therapy including esophageal stricture after esophageal early cancer endoscopic submucosal dissection(ESD)and lung air leaks. We would like to continue development of cell sheet-based regenerative medicine to treat frail, sarcopenia, and cancer cachexia after surgery, chemotherapy, and radio therapy by supplying stem cells and paracrine effects.
