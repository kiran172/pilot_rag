Title: Inflammation and Rho-Associated Protein Kinase-Induced Brain Changes in Vascular Dementia.

Abstract: Patients with vascular dementia, caused by cerebral ischemia, experience long-term cognitive impairment due to the lack of effective treatment. The mechanisms of and treatments for vascular dementia have been investigated in various animal models; however, the insufficient information on gene expression changes that define pathological conditions hampers progress. To investigate the underlying mechanism of and facilitate treatment development for vascular dementia, we established a mouse model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, including bilateral carotid artery stenosis, by using microcoils, and elucidated the molecular pathway underlying vascular dementia development. Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) 1/2, which regulates cellular structure, and inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 and IL-6) were upregulated in the vascular dementia model. However, expression of claudin-5, which maintains the blood-brain barrier, and MAP2 as a nerve cell-specific factor, was decreased in the hippocampal region of the vascular dementia model. Thus, we revealed that ROCK pathway activation loosens the tight junction of the blood-brain barrier and increases the influx of inflammatory cytokines into the hippocampal region, leading to neuronal death and causing cognitive and emotional dysfunction. Our vascular dementia model allows effective study of the vascular dementia mechanism. Moreover, the ROCK pathway may be a target for vascular dementia treatment development in the future.
