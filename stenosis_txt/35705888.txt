Title: Outcomes of Endovascular Therapy in Young Patients with Acute Basilar Artery Occlusion: A Substudy of BASILAR Registry Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to investigate clinical outcomes in young patients with basilar artery occlusion (BAO) receiving endovascular therapy (EVT).
METHODS: Consecutive patients with BAO within 24 h who underwent EVT from the BASILAR Registry study were enrolled. We compared clinical outcomes of young patients (aged 18-55 years) with older patients (aged > 55 years) with stroke due to BAO at 90 days and 1 year after EVT. The primary and secondary outcomes were improvement in modified Rankin scale scores (mRS) at 90 days and either favorable (mRS 0-3) or mortality at 90 days, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 646 patients were included, of which 152 (23.53%) were aged 18-55 years. Dyslipidemia (42.11% vs. 30.36%, p = 0.007) and good collateral circulation (60.52% vs. 46.35%, p = 0.002) were more frequent in young patients than older. Stroke etiologies in young patients included large artery atherosclerosis (67.11%), cardioembolism (15.13%), and vessel dissection (5.26%). Young patients were associated with better prognosis (mRS: adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.73; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21-2.48; mRS 0-3: aOR 1.60; 95% CI 1.01-2.54; mortality: aOR 0.60; 95% CI 0.38-0.93) at 90 days. Baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography Score (pc-ASPECTS), and sex were independent predictors of clinical outcomes of young patients at 90 days after EVT.
CONCLUSION: Young patients with BAO had better clinical outcomes after EVT than old patients. Predictors of clinical outcomes in young patients undergoing EVT included baseline NIHSS score, pc-ASPECTS, and sex.
