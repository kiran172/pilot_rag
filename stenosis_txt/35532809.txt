Title: The early and long-term outcomes of coronary artery bypass grafting added to aortic valve replacement compared to isolated aortic valve replacement in elderly patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: In aged population, the early and long-term outcomes of coronary revascularization (CABG) added to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) compared to isolated SAVR (i-SAVR) are conflicting. To address this limitation, a meta-analysis comparing the early and late outcomes of SAVR plus CABG with i-SAVR was performed. Electronic databases from January 2000 to November 2021 were screened. Studies reporting early-term and long-term comparison between the two treatments in patients over 75 years were analyzed. The primary endpoints were in-hospital/30-day mortality and overall long-term survival. The pooled odd ratio (OR) and hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for in-early outcome and long-term survival, respectively. Random-effect model was used in all analyses. Forty-four retrospective observational studies reporting on 74,560 patients (i-SAVR = 36,062; SAVR + CABG = 38,498) were included for comparison. The pooled analysis revealed that i-SAVR was significantly associated with lower rate of early mortality compared to SAVR plus CABG (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.66-0.75; p < 0.0001) and with lower incidence of postoperative acute renal failure (OR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.50-0.91; p = 0.02), need for dialysis (OR = 0.65; 95% CI 0.50-0.86; p = 0.002) and prolonged mechanical ventilation (OR = 0.57; 95% CI 0.42-0.77; p < 0.0001). Twenty-two studies reported data of long-term follow-up. No differences were reported between the two groups in long-term survival (HR = 0.95; 95% CI  0.87-1.03; p = 0.23). CABG added to SAVR is associated with worse early outcomes in terms of early mortality, postoperative acute renal failure, and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Long-term survival was comparable between the two treatments.
