Title: Reoperations After Percutaneous Endoscopic Transforaminal Decompression for Treating Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: Incidence and Predictors.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study.
OBJECTIVES: The main purpose of the present study was to report the incidence and identify predictors of reoperation in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) treated with percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal decompression (PETD).
METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed consecutive patients with LSS who underwent PETD at our center between January 2016 and July 2020. The incidence of reoperations was calculated. We then designed a surgical period-matched case-control study to identify predictors among demographic data, clinical baseline data, and imaging parameters.
RESULTS: This study identified 496 eligible patients. 33 (6.7%) patients underwent reoperation with a mean follow-up of 3 years, consisting 22 (4.4%) at the index level and 11 (2.2%) at the adjacent levels. There were significant differences in age and age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (AACCI) between the two groups, with younger age (P = .004) and lower AACCI (P = .019) in reoperation group. Age was identified as the sole independent predictor (P = .006). The duration of symptoms ≥12 months (P = .034) and the presence of heart problems (P = .012) were recognized as specific predictors among patients younger than 65 years.
CONCLUSIONS: In a mean follow-up of 3 years, the incidence of reoperation in LSS treated with PETD was 6.7%. A younger age was the independent predictor for reoperation. Younger patients with the duration of symptoms ≥12 months or without heart problems were more likely to undergo a second operation. Prospective randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these findings.
