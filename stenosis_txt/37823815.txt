Title: [Surgery, Antibiotic Treatment or Both?].

Abstract: The 90-year-old female patient with underlying rheumatoid arthritis and spinal canal stenosis was admitted to hospital for pain control. The clinical exam of the lower abdomen was impressively painful and the inflammatory parameters were significantly increased. For further diagnosis a computer tomography was performed, showing a covered perforated appendicitis with a perityphlitic abscess. The conservative therapy with abscess drainage and antibiotics was successful.
