Title: Renal intravascular shockwave lithotripsy in complex mono Ch-EVAR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Our objective is to present the Peripheral Intravascular Lithotripsy (IVL) System in the treatment of calcific renal artery stenosis (RAS) during Chimney Endovascular Aneurysm Repair (Ch-EVAR). The Ch-EVAR technique is a bail out procedure in treating aortic aneurysms with challenging anatomy regarding the proximal sealing zone. RAS typically involves varying degrees of calcification, and final treatment can be fraught with risk of vessel's damages and suboptimal results, particularly when renal angioplasty represents the only feasible course of action in Ch-EVAR.
METHOD: We present a case of a patient with a complex juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm and a pre-obstructive chalky stenosis of the right renal artery who underwent mono ChEVAR associated to visceral Intravascular Lithotripsy shockwave angioplasty.
CONCLUSION: IVL is an attractive modality for the treatment of challenging, heavily calcified renal arteries that combines the calcium-disrupting capability of lithotripsy with the familiarity of balloon catheters to facilitate proper stent deployment.
RESULT: We propose the IVL system as an additional tool in the vascular surgeon's armamentarium not only to obtain large-bore access to enable Transaortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) and EVAR but also to perform angioplasty of severely calcified visceral arteries during Ch-EVAR.
