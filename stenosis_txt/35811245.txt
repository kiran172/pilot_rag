Title: Comparison of coronary CT angiography-based and invasive coronary angiography-based quantitative flow ratio for functional assessment of coronary stenosis: A multicenter retrospective analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance of coronary CT angiography (CTA)-based quantitative flow ratio (QFR), namely CT-QFR, and compare it with invasive coronary angiography (ICA)-based Murray law QFR (μQFR), using fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the reference standard.
METHODS: Patients who underwent coronary CTA, ICA and pressure wire-based FFR assessment within two months were retrospectively analyzed. CT-QFR and μQFR were computed in blinded fashion and compared with FFR, all applying the same cut-off value of ≤0.80 to identify hemodynamically significant stenosis.
RESULTS: Paired comparison between CT-QFR and μQFR was performed in 191 vessels from 167 patients. Average FFR was 0.81 ​± ​0.10 and 42.4% vessels had an FFR ≤0.80. CT-QFR had a slightly lower correlation with FFR compared with μQFR, although statistically non-significant (r ​= ​0.87 versus 0.90, p ​= ​0.110). The vessel-level diagnostic performance of CT-QFR was slightly lower but without statistical significance than μQFR (AUC ​= ​0.94 versus 0.97, difference: -0.03 [95%CI: -0.00-0.06], p ​= ​0.095), and substantially higher than diameter stenosis by CTA (AUC difference: 0.17 [95%CI: -0.10-0.23], p ​< ​0.001). The patient-level diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio for CT-QFR to identify FFR value ​≤ ​0.80 was 88%, 90%, 86%, 86%, 91%, 6.59 and 0.12, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of CT-QFR was 84% in extensively calcified lesions, while in vessels with no or less calcification, CT-QFR showed a comparable diagnostic accuracy with μQFR (91% versus 92%, p ​= ​0.595). Intra- and inter-observer variability in CT-QFR analysis was -0.00 ​± ​0.04 and 0.00 ​± ​0.04, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Performance in diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis by CT-QFR was slightly lower but without statistical significance than μQFR, and substantially higher than CTA-derived diameter stenosis. Extensively calcified lesions reduced the diagnostic accuracy of CT-QFR.
