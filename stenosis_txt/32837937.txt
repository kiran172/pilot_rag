Title: Bedside Tracheostomy: Our Experience in a Tertiary Care Hospital.

Abstract: Tracheostomy is the creation of a stoma at the surface of skin, which leads into trachea. In the critically ill patients, it is one of the most frequently done procedure especially in intensive care unit (ICU) for those requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. About 24% of all patients in ICU need tracheostomy (Esteban et al. in Am J Respir Crit Care Med 161:1450-1458, 2000). Historically it had a high complication rate and so many authors suggested that it should be done only in operating room (Dayal and Masri in Laryngoscope 96:5862, 1986). A standardized procedure to reduce complications was described by Jackson (Laryngoscope 19:285-290, 1909). The aim of the study is to observe and analyze the outcome of bedside open tracheostomy, in relation to its safety, complications and simplicity. Study consists of 200 patients who underwent bedside tracheostomies in a tertiary care center from 2014 to 2017 in medical/surgical/paediatric ICU's. All the procedures followed a standard protocol. In all the surgeries, two E.N.T. surgeons were scrubbed and did the procedure, assisted by two ICU nurses. One anesthetist who administered sedation and monitored the patient. If coagulation disturbances were present in elective case then they were corrected prior to the procedure. We all want the latest, safest, simplest and cheapest available technique in medical practice. Bedside tracheostomy is one such procedure. It is better than tracheostomy in operating room for patients who need prolonged mechanical ventilation in ICU as it eliminates the need of patient transport to OR and its associated complications and also minimizing cost. Training programs need to be provided to the assisting staff for better procedural outcome.
