Title: Celiac Axis Stenosis as an Independent Risk Factor for Bile Leakage in Laparoscopic Pancreaticoduodenectomy: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: Background: Celiac axis stenosis can potentially lead to insufficient blood supply to vital organs, such as the liver, spleen, pancreas, and stomach. This condition result in the development of collateral circulation between the superior mesenteric artery and the hepatic artery. However, these collateral circulations are often disrupted during pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), which may increase the risk of postoperative complications. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy (LPD) from April 2015 to April 2023. Celiac trunk stenosis is classified according to the degree of stenosis: no stenosis (&lt;30%), grade A (30%-&lt;50%), grade B (50%-≤80%), and grade C (&gt;80%). The incidence of postoperative complications was evaluated, and both univariate and multivariate risk analyses were conducted. Results: A total of 997 patients were included in the study, with mild celiac axis stenosis present in 23 (2.3%) patients, moderate stenosis in 18 (1.8%) patients, and severe stenosis in 10 (1.0%) patients. Independent risk factors for the development of bile leakage, as identified by both univariate and multivariate analyses, included body mass index (BMI) (HR = 1.108, 95% CI = 1.008-1.218, P = .033), intra-abdominal infection (HR = 2.607, 95% CI = 1.308-5.196, P = .006), postoperative hemorrhage (HR = 4.510, 95% CI = 2.048-9.930, P = &lt;0.001), and celiac axis stenosis (50%-≤80%, HR = 4.235, 95% CI = 1.153-15.558, P = .030), and (&gt;80%, HR = 4.728, 95% CI = .882-25.341, P = .047). Celiac axis stenosis, however, was not determined to be an independent risk factor for pancreatic fistula (P &gt; 0.05). Additionally, the presence of an aberrant hepatic artery did not significantly increase the risk of postoperative complications when compared with celiac axis stenosis alone. Conclusion: Severe celiac axis stenosis is an independent risk factor for postoperative bile leakage following LPD.
