Title: Bilateral watershed infarcts due to hypoperfusion in the context of drug abuse: case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Watershed infarcts (WIs) are a distinct type of stroke with a varying clinical presentation that affects the border areas between the territories of two cerebral arteries and are typically associated with hemodynamic impairment and internal carotid artery stenosis. However, there is a paucity of data concerning its association with the history of recreational substance and drug abuse.
METHODS/CASE REPORT: This case report presents a unique instance of bilateral internal watershed infarcts in a 23-year-old male with a history of polysubstance abuse, including methadone and cocaine. The patient's presentation included confusion, lower limb weakness, and systemic complications such as acute liver injury and myonecrosis, underlying the complexity of the clinical scenario.
RESULTS: The investigation revealed no evidence of arterial stenosis or thrombosis, leading to the conclusion that the infarctions were likely precipitated by a total loss of consciousness due to substance abuse-related cerebral hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction. Methadone and cocaine, both implicated in vasoconstriction, lowering the seizure threshold and contributing to QTc prolongation, thus leading to loss of consciousness, were identified as potential triggers for the episode.
CONCLUSIONS: In the young adult population, it is important to consider drug abuse as an etiological trigger for watershed infarcts, whereas the multi-system involvement and atypical presentation highlight the need for a comprehensive approach.
