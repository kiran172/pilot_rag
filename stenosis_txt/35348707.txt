Title: Radical surgery for a mitral valve intimal sarcoma: serial patch repair of the annulus and atrium.

Abstract: We report the rare case of a 48-year-old woman with a cardiac intimal sarcoma occupying the mitral valve and the left atrial roof. We resected the tumour in one block without residual lesions. The anterior mitral annulus and left atrial roof were serially repaired with the bovine pericardium, and a mechanical prosthesis was implanted in the reconstructed mitral annulus. The patient remains alive without recurrence for more than 1 and a half years postoperatively. We performed radical surgery for a mitral valve intimal sarcoma, and serial patch repair of the anterior mitral annulus and left atrial roof was a useful technique.
