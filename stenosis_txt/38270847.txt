Title: Dysregulation of micro-RNA 143-3p as a Biomarker of Carotid Atherosclerosis and the Associated Immune Reactions During Disease Progression.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis commonly remains undiagnosed until disease manifestations occur. The disease is associated with dysregulated micro(mi)RNAs, but how this is linked to atherosclerosis-related immune reactions is largely unknown. A mouse model of carotid atherosclerosis, human APOB100-transgenic Ldlr-/- (HuBL), was used to study the spatiotemporal dysregulation of a set of miRNAs. Middle-aged HuBL mice with established atherosclerosis had decreased levels of miR-143-3p in their carotid arteries. In young HuBL mice, early atherosclerosis was observed in the carotid bifurcation, which had lower levels of miR-15a-5p, miR-143-3p, and miR-199a-3p, and higher levels of miR-155-5p. The dysregulation of these miRNAs was reflected by specific immune responses during atheroprogression. Finally, levels of miR-143-3p were 70.6% lower in extracellular vesicles isolated from the plasma of patients with carotid stenosis compared to healthy controls. Since miR-143-3p levels progressively decrease when transitioning between early and late experimental carotid atherosclerosis, we propose it as a biomarker for atherosclerosis.
