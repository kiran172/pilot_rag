Title: Vertebrobasilar Infarction Due to Bow Hunter's Syndrome in a Patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 60-year-old woman with a 37-year history of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) had a sudden onset of headache. Head MRI showed acute multiple infarctions in the vertebrobasilar region, and MR angiography showed stenosis of the right vertebral artery (VA). 3D-CT angiography of the craniovertebral junction showed atlantoaxial subluxation and stenosis of the right VA just distal to the transverse foramen of C2, which was due to osteophytes and degenerative changes secondary to RA. Digital subtraction angiography clearly demonstrated occlusion of the right VA during rightward head rotation. Based on those findings, rotatory instability at C1-2 was considered as the primary cause of the vertebrobasilar infarctions, and Bow Hunter's syndrome was diagnosed. The patient underwent C1-5 posterior fixation, and brain infarction has not recurred.
