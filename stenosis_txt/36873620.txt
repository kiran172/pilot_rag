Title: Olfactory Dysfunction, an Often Neglected Symptom of Hydrocephalus: Experience from a Case of Late-Onset Idiopathic Aqueductal Stenosis.

Abstract: Disturbance of smell is often accompanied with common neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. In addition, patients with head trauma, intracranial tumors, and hydrocephalus can also develop olfactory dysfunction, and some of which can improve with treatment of the underlying disease. In clinical practice, few patients complain of smell disturbances, thus olfactory dysfunction is often overshadowed by visible motor symptoms. Herein, we report a case of late-onset idiopathic aqueductal stenosis, a rare form of adult-onset hydrocephalus in which olfactory dysfunction and gait disturbance was markedly improved after endoscopic ventriculostomy. This case report is expected to make more physicians aware that hydrocephalus can cause olfactory dysfunction and that it can be corrected postoperatively. Furthermore, in addition to motor and neuropsychological function, olfactory function test might be useful for functional assessment before and after surgical treatment of hydrocephalus.
