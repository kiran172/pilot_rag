Title: Redundant nerve root syndrome mimicking an intradural spinal cord tumor: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The redundant nerve root (RNR) syndrome is a pathological condition in which the cauda equina develops into a severely flexed/tortuous spiral mass above a level of severe lumbar stenosis.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 70-year-old male presented with bilateral neurogenic claudication attributed to a MRI-documented intradural extramedullary lesion at the L1 level with severe adjacent level/inferior L2/3 stenosis. At surgery, intradural exploration at L1 revealed an edematous cauda equina consistent with the diagnosis of the RNR syndrome.
CONCLUSION: The RNR syndrome should be included among the differential diagnostic considerations when non-enhancing lesions are encountered above levels of marked lumbar stenosis.
