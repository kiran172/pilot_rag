Title: Muscular injury was identified the risk factor of post-operative stenosis after large area but non-circumferential esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The incidence of post-operative stenosis after esophageal Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) ranks high. This study aimed to investigate the association between the degree of muscular injury and the incidence of post-operative stenosis.
RESEARCH DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of 133 patients with superficial esophageal lesions treated by non-circumferential ESD enrolled between January 2016 and May 2021 at two endoscopy centers. Demographic and clinical parameters were analyzed. A novel muscular injury classification system was proposed. Stenosis risk factors were identified using multivariate logistic regression. The association between the different degrees of muscular injury and the incidence of post-operative stenosis was investigated further by propensity score matching (PSM).
RESULTS: There were 133 cases evaluated in this study, 33 of which developed stenosis. Multivariate analysis suggested lesions located in the upper 1/3 of the esophagus, resections &gt;5/6 of the circumference, and muscular injury (Grade 3 or 4 according to our proposed classification) were risk factors for stenosis. Correlation analysis suggested a positive association between the degree of muscular injury and the incidence of post-operative stenosis (r = 0.408, p &lt; .05). For PSM, 29 stenosis cases were matched and univariate analysis further corroborated that muscular injuries of grade 3 (OR = 6.429, 95%CI = 1.318-31.367, p = .021) or 4 (OR = 7, 95%CI = 1.068-45.901, p = .043) were risk factors for stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Grade 3-4 muscular injury was identified as a risk factor of post-operative stenosis.
