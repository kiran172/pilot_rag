Title: Treatment of Coronary De Novo Lesions by a Sirolimus- or Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to investigate a novel sirolimus-coated balloon (SCB) compared with the best investigated paclitaxel-coated balloon (PCB).
BACKGROUND: There is increasing clinical evidence for the treatment of coronary de novo disease using drug-coated balloons. However, it is unclear whether paclitaxel remains the drug of choice or if sirolimus is an alternative, in analogy to drug-eluting stents.
METHODS: Seventy patients with coronary de novo lesions were enrolled in a randomized, multicenter trial to compare a novel SCB (SeQuent SCB, B. Braun Melsungen; 4 μg/mm2) with a PCB (SeQuent Please, B. Braun Melsungen; 3 μg/mm2). The primary endpoint was angiographic late lumen loss (LLL) at 6 months. Secondary endpoints included major adverse cardiovascular events and individual clinical endpoints such as cardiac death, target lesion myocardial infarction, clinically driven target lesion revascularization, and binary restenosis.
RESULTS: Quantitative coronary angiography revealed no differences in baseline parameters. After 6 months, in-segment LLL was 0.01 ± 0.33 mm in the PCB group versus 0.10 ± 0.32 mm in the SCB group. The mean difference between SCB and PCB was 0.08 (95% CI: -0.07 to 0.24). Noninferiority at a predefined margin of 0.35 was shown. However, negative LLL was more frequent in the PCB group (60% of lesions vs 32% in the SCB group; P = 0.019). Major adverse cardiovascular events up to 12 months also did not differ between the groups.
CONCLUSIONS: This first-in-human comparison of a novel SCB with a crystalline coating showed similar angiographic outcomes in the treatment of coronary de novo disease compared with a clinically proven PCB. However, late luminal enlargement was more frequently observed after PCB treatment.
