Title: The effects of fibroblast growth factor-23 on diagnosis of cerebral infarction and vertebral basilar artery stenosis☆.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the correlation between Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23) levels and Cerebral Infarction (CI), and to determine whether there is a significant relationship between FGF23 and the occurrence and severity of CI.
METHODS: The study categorized Cerebral Infarction (CI) patients into severe and mild stenosis groups based on vertebrobasilar artery stenosis, using Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The study compared the levels of Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23) in the serum of CI patients and healthy controls using a t-test and evaluated the diagnostic effectiveness of serum FGF23 using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve. Additionally, the study analyzed the correlation between FGF23 levels and CI severity after treatment using the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score.
RESULTS: The study found a significant increase in serum Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23) levels in patients with Cerebral Infarction (CI) compared to healthy volunteers, (p &lt; 0.001). A higher serum FGF23 level was observed in the severe stenosis group than in the mild stenosis group (p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the study showed that a high FGF23 level at admission was significantly related to more severe symptoms of CI as indicated by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score on the 7th day after treatment (p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: This study discovered a correlation between Fibroblast Growth Factor-23 (FGF23) levels, vertebrobasilar artery stenosis, and short-term prognosis in patients who had recently experienced acute Cerebral Infarction (CI).
