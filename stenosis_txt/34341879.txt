Title: Plasmatic PCSK9 Levels Are Associated with Very Fast Progression of Asymptomatic Degenerative Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: The aim of this work was to study the association of potential biomarkers with fast aortic stenosis (AS) progression. Patients with moderate-to-severe AS were classified as very fast progressors (VFP) if exhibited an annualized change in peak velocity (aΔVmax) ≥0.45m/s/year and/or in aortic valve area (aΔAVA) ≥-0.2cm2/year. Respective cut-off values of ≥0.3m/s/year and ≥-0.1cm2/year defined fast progressors (FP), whereas the remaining patients were non-fast progressors (non-FP). Baseline markers of lipid metabolism, inflammation, and cardiac overload were determined. Two hundred and nine patients (97 non-FP, 38 FP, and 74 VFP) were included. PCSK9 levels were significantly associated with VFP (OR 1.014 [95%CI 1.005-1.024], for every 10 ng/mL), as were active smoking (OR 3.48) and body mass index (BMI, OR 1.09), with an AUC of 0.704 for the model. PCSK9 levels, active smoking, and BMI were associated with very fast AS progression in our series, suggesting that inflammation and calcification participate in disease progression.
