Title: Unusual variations in the branching pattern of the coeliac trunk and their clinical significance.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The anatomical variations of the coeliac trunk are due to developmental changes in the ventral segmental arteries. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) has been used to investigate vascular anatomy for scientific and diagnostic purposes. These studies allow for much larger sample sizes than traditional cadaveric studies. The aim of this research was to isolate rare anatomical variants of the coeliac trunk and emphasize their clinical significance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A descriptive, retrospective study was carried out on MDCT angiographies performed from January 2020 till March 2020 in Polish patients. Coeliac trunk was studied and normal and anatomical variations were identified.
RESULTS: Out of total 350 patients, hepatogastrosplenic trunk was predominant. However, we observed: coeliaco-mesenteric and hepatogastric trunk type, hepatic artery variations and coeliac axis stenosis with collateral mesenteric circulation.
CONCLUSIONS: Rare variations of the coeliac trunk should always be anticipated before radiological and surgical interventions. Knowledge of unusual coeliac trunk anatomy is important in hepatopancreatobiliary surgery, transplantology, and interventional radiology.
