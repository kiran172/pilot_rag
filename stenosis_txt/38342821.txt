Title: Occipital emissary vein existence and its impact on the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension in pediatric patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of occipital emissary vein (OEV) detection in the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IHH) in the pediatric age group, and to compare the prevalence and luminal diameter of OEV in patients with IHH and in healthy control subjects.
METHODS: Conventional magnetic resonance imaging findings were assessed in the patients with IHH and in healthy control subjects who were under the age of 18, by two observers. The presence and luminal dimension of OEV and transverse sinus stenosis were also evaluated and compared between these two groups with magnetic resonance venography techniques.
RESULTS: The rate of OEV existence was 7 times higher in the IIH group compared to the control group based on the second observer outcome (p = 0.010, OR = 7.0), with a very good interobserver agreement (Ƙ = 0.85). The dimension of OEV ranged between 0.6 and 2.5 mm. There was no correlation found between the opening pressure and the dimension of OEV (p = 0.834).
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, OEV existence could be an additional radiological finding for diagnosing IHH among pediatric patients, alongside other conventional findings.
