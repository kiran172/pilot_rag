Title: Stentless treatment strategy for left circumflex artery ostial stenosis: Directional coronary atherectomy followed by drug-eluting balloon.

Abstract: A 60-year-old man with history of exertional angina pectoris was referred for treatment of an ostial left circumflex (LCX) coronary artery stenosis. The branch angle between left anterior descending artery (LAD) and LCX was shallow, therefore stent implantation seemed at risk of "carina shift" of plaque to the LAD ostium as well as higher in-stent restenosis. Therefore, directional coronary atherectomy (DCA, Atherocut™, L-size, NIPRO, Osaka, Japan) was performed at the ostium of the LCX lesion. After evaluating plaque accumulation using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), DCA was circumferentially performed 16 times, from 2 atm to 3 atm, using an 8 fr guide system. Although angiogram and IVUS showed excellent results, adjunctive balloon dilatation with 3.5 mm paclitaxel-coated balloon was performed to prevent restenosis. At 8 months, the patient reported being angina-free, and subsequent follow-up angiogram showed no restenosis of LCX. Paclitaxel-coated balloon following DCA for LCX ostial stenosis seems to be safe and effective for both acute and chronic results, suggesting a potential stentless therapeutic option. &lt;Learning objective: Directional coronary atherectomy in combination with drug-eluting balloon may be a potential stentless therapeutic option, especially for the ostial stenosis of left circumflex artery.&gt;.
