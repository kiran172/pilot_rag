Title: Impact of Bileaflet Mechanical Mitral Valve Orientation on Pannus Overgrowth.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Pannus overgrowth is a chronic inflammatory process that can cause valve dysfunction and threaten the durability of prosthetic valves. Bileaflet mechanical mitral valve can be implanted in either an anatomical (parallel to the anatomical axis) or nonanatomical (perpendicular or oblique to the anatomical axis) orientation. The effect of the rotational orientation of the bileaflet mechanical mitral valve on excessive pannus enlargement is unknown. The present study compared the effect of bileaflet mechanical mitral valve orientation on pannus overgrowth.
METHODS: The study included patients who underwent bileaflet mechanical mitral valve replacement for rheumatic mitral valve stenosis. The pannus formation was confirmed by reexamining all transesophageal echocardiography images in the picture archiving and communication systems between May 2017 and April 2021. The primary aim of this study was the development of pannus overgrowth. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on their implantation orientation of the bileaflet mechanical mitral valve.
RESULTS: Pannus overgrowth was found in 26 patients (56.5%) in the anatomical orientation group and 71 patients (74.7%) in the nonanatomical orientation group (P = 0.03). Anatomical orientation reduced the development of pannus overgrowth (odds ratio [OR] = 0.39, P = 0.04), and double left heart valve replacement increased the development of pannus overgrowth (OR = 2.73, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Pannus overgrowth was less common in bileaflet mechanical mitral valves implanted in the anatomical orientation.
