Title: Effects of left ventricular mass on computed tomography derived fractional flow reserve in significant obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In significant obstructive coronary artery disease (SOCAD), a mismatch in assessment of severity of coronary artery stenosis may occur between invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and computed tomography (CT) derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>). The present study aimed to identify the factors giving an FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80 and leading to an underestimation of coronary artery severity in SOCAD vessels.
METHODS: A total of 141 consecutive patients who underwent both CT angiography including FFR<sub>CT</sub> and ICA, the latter showing &gt;75% coronary artery stenosis were evaluated. Vessels were divided into two groups according to FFR<sub>CT</sub> at the distal aspect of the vessel: FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80 (n = 12) and FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 (n = 153). Vessel morphology, plaque characteristics, left-ventricular (LV) wall thickness at each site of the myocardium, and LV mass were also assessed.
RESULTS: LV myocardium-related parameters including LV wall thickness (base, middle, apex, average, and maximal), LV mass, and LV mass index were higher in FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80, whereas vessel-related parameters including, vessel morphology and plaque characteristics were not significantly different between &gt;0.80 and &lt; 0.80. Vessel morphology and plaque characteristics had no effect on FFR<sub>CT</sub>, whereas maximum LV wall thickness, LV mass, and LV mass index influenced FFR<sub>CT</sub>. LV mass index was the strongest predictor of distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80 with an area under the curve of 0.81, and an optimal cut-off value of 66.5 g/m2 (sensitivity 77.8%, specificity 89.6%).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of a high LV mass is a major cause for underestimation of coronary artery severity on FFR<sub>CT</sub> in SOCAD vessels. LV myocardium-related parameters should be considered when interpreting numerical values of FFR<sub>CT</sub>.
