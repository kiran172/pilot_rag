Title: Critical stenosis of the celiac trunk by the arcuate ligament, successfully treated by a laparoscopic approach.

Abstract: A 56-year-old female was referred to our department with a five-month history of progressive abdominal pain related to physical exertion and copious meals. The pain was located in the mesogastric region and the right flank and remitted when the patient lay in the recumbent position with the knees bent. The patient reported nausea and a weight loss of 12 kg over the previous ten years. She had been diagnosed 18 years previously with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer and had undergone a hysterectomy and partial nephrectomy.
