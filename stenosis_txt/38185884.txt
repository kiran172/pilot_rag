Title: The Effect of Gender on Triple Heart Valve Surgery Outcomes; Reinforcing Women's Health.

Abstract: Female gender is a risk factor in several cardiac surgery risk stratification systems. This study explored the differences in the outcomes following triple heart valve surgery in men vs women. The study included 250 patients (males n = 101; females n = 149) who underwent triple valve surgery from 2009 to 2020. BMI (body mass index) was higher in females (29.6 vs 26.5Â kg/m2, P &lt; .001), and diabetes was more common in males (44 vs 42%, P = .012). The ejection fraction was higher in females (55 vs 50%, P &lt; .001). The severity of mitral valve stenosis and tricuspid valve regurgitation was significantly greater in females (33.11 vs 27.72%, P = .003 and 44.30 vs 19.8%, P &lt; .001, respectively). Mitral valve replacement was more common in females (P &lt; .001), and they had lower concomitant coronary artery bypass grafting (P = .001). Bleeding and renal failure were lower in females (P = .021 and &lt;0.001, respectively). Hospital mortality, readmission, and reintervention were not significantly different between genders. By multivariable analysis, male gender was a risk factor for lower survival [HR (hazard ratio): 2.18; P = .024]. Triple valve surgery can be performed safely in both genders, with better long-term survival in females. Female gender was not a risk factor in patients undergoing triple valve surgery.
