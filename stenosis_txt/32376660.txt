Title: Orbital infarction syndrome after mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke.

Abstract: Orbital infarction syndrome (OIS) encompasses the ischaemic infarction of all intraorbital and intraocular structures (optic nerve, extraocular muscles and orbital fat) which leads to a painful loss of visual acuity, ophthalmoparesis, chemosis, proptosis and ptosis. The rich anastomotic orbital vascularisation from internal carotid artery (ICA) and external carotid artery makes this disorder a rare cause of visual loss in stroke patients. We describe a case of a woman who suffered an acute occlusion of her right ICA and developed an OIS after mechanical thrombectomy.
