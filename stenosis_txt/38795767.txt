Title: MiR-127-3p enhances macrophagic proliferation via disturbing fatty acid profiles and oxidative phosphorylation in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is a chronic pathology, leading to acute coronary heart disease or stroke. MiR-127 has been found significantly upregulated in advanced atherosclerosis. But its function in atherosclerosis remains unexplored. We explored the role of miR-127-3p in regulating atherosclerosis development and its downstream mechanisms.
METHODS: The expression profile of miR-127 in carotid atherosclerotic plaques of 23 patients with severe carotid stenosis was detected by RT-qPCR and in situ hybridization. Primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) stimulated with oxidized low-density lipoprotein were used as an in vitro model. CCK-8, EdU, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry were used to detect the proliferative capacity and polarization of BMDM, which were infected by lentivirus-carrying plasmid to upregulate or downregulate miR-127-3p expression, respectively. RNA sequencing combined with bioinformatic analysis and targeted fatty acid metabolomics approach were used to detect the transcriptome and lipid metabolites. The association between miR-127-3p and its target was verified by dual-luciferase activity reporting and Western blotting. Oxygen consumption rate of BMDM were detected using seahorse analysis. High-cholesterol-diet-fed low density lipoprotein deficient (LDLR-/-) mice, with-or-without carotid tandem-stenosis surgery, were treated with miR-127-3p agomir or antagomir to examine its effect on plaque development and stability.
RESULTS: miR-127-3p, not -5p, is elevated in human advanced carotid atheroma and its expression is positively associated with macrophage accummulation in plaques. In vitro, miR-127-3p-overexpressed macrophage exhibites increased proliferation capacity and facilitates M1 polariztion whereas the contrary trend is present in miR-127-3p-inhibited macrophage. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1) is one potential target of miR-127-3p. miR-127-3p mimics decreases the activity of 3' untranslated regions of SCD-1. Furthermore, miR-127-3p downregulates SCD1 expression, and reversing the expression of SCD1 attenuates the increased proliferation induced by miR-127-3p overexpression in macrophage. miR-127-3p overexpression could also lead to decreased content of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), increased content of acetyl CoA and increased level of oxidative phosphorylation. In vivo, miR-127-3p agomir significantly increases atherosclerosis progression, macrophage proliferation and decreases SCD1 expression and the content of UFAs in aortic plaques of LDLR-/- mice. Conversely, miR-127-3p antagomir attenuated atherosclerosis, macrophage proliferation in LDLR-/- mice, and enhanced carotid plaque stability in mice with vulnerable plaque induced.
CONCLUSION: MiR-127-3p enhances proliferation in macrophages through downregulating SCD-1 expression and decreasing the content of unsaturated fatty acid, thereby promoting atherosclerosis development and decreasing plaque stability. miR-127-3p/SCD1/UFAs might provide potential therapeutic target for anti-inflammation and atherosclerosis.
