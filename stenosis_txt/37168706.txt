Title: Urgent endovascular maneuvers to rescue a failing transplant kidney with a T-stent approach.

Abstract: Renal artery thrombosis (RAT) is a major cause of renal transplant loss and, for this reason, should be treated promptly. We present a case of a 48-year-old man with external iliac thrombosis associated with thrombosis of a transplant renal artery that led to worsening of renal function. Multiple mechanisms have been identified in the literature as risk factors for RAT. In our patient, a combination of anastomotic stenosis, hypercoagulability, and diabetic nephropathy had resulted in RAT, and an unconventional endovascular revascularization technique with a T-stent approach was needed to guarantee patency of the treated vessels. No 30-day perioperative complications occurred, and the postoperative follow-up examination showed patency of the treated vessels; thus, transplant loss was avoided.
