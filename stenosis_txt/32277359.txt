Title: Ask-Upmark kidney in a girl with neurofibromatosis type 1.

Abstract: Ask-Upmark kidney (AUK) is a scarred segment of the kidney, characterized by formation of primitive tubular and glomerular structures, and sporadically diagnosed as a cause of hypertension (HTN). A 6-year-old girl with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and moyamoya syndrome had severe HTN. Based on past history, she had HTN at the age of 1.5Â years. Laboratory examination revealed slightly elevated plasma and renal venous renin activity without lateralization. No evidence of pheochromocytoma, or coarctation of the aorta was found. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed an area of hypoperfusion in the upper and middle poles with reduced size of the right kidney. The results of dimercaptosuccinic acid scintigraphy were in accordance with those of contrast-enhanced CT. Selected renal arteriography revealed a paucity of peripheral vascularity in the same parts of the right kidney. In the absence of a history of urinary tract infection and vesicoureteral reflux by cystography, we presumed that the severe HTN may be due to segmental hypoplasia of the kidney, AUK, with a possible contribution from NF1. Although renal artery stenosis and pheochromocytoma are well-known causes of HTN in NF1, this case demonstrates that HTN can be caused by AUK in patients with NF1.
