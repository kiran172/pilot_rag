Title: Variations in Practice Patterns for Peripheral Vascular Interventions Across Clinical Settings.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peripheral vascular interventions (PVIs) for lower extremity peripheral artery disease have been increasing, particularly in the office-based setting. Our goal was to evaluate practice patterns for PVI by site of service using a contemporary real-world dataset.
METHODS: The Vascular Quality Initiative PVI registry was queried from 2010-2021. Site of service was classified as hospital/inpatient, hospital/outpatient, and ambulatory/office-based center. Patient demographics, comorbidities, procedural details, and periprocedural outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 54,897 hospital/inpatient (43.2%), 64,105 hospital/outpatient (50.4%), and 8,179 ambulatory/office-based center (6.4%) PVI. When comparing the 2 outpatient settings, ambulatory/office-based center patients were older than hospital/outpatient (mean age 70.7 vs. 68.7 years), more often female sex (41.4% vs. 39.1%), never smokers (27.5% vs. 18.5%), primary Medicare (61.6% vs. 55.9%), nonambulatory (6.5% vs. 4.7%), less often with coronary artery disease (30.2% vs. 34.1%), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18.1% vs. 26.9%), congestive heart failure (13% vs. 17.2%), obesity (30.9% vs. 33.6%), and less often on a statin (71.4% vs. 76.1%) (P < 0.001). Ambulatory/office-based center procedures were more likely for claudication (60.1% vs. 55.8%), more often involved femoro-popliteal (73.1% vs. 64.6%) and infrapopliteal (36.7% vs. 24.3%), and less often iliac interventions (24.1% vs. 33.6%) (P < 0.001).Overall, atherectomy was used in 14.2% of hospital/inpatient, 19.4% of hospital/outpatient, and 63.4% of ambulatory/office-based center procedures. Stents were used in 41.8% of hospital/inpatient, 45.1% of hospital/outpatient, and 48.8% of ambulatory/office-based center procedures. However, stent grafts were used in 12.5% of hospital/inpatient, 8.8% of hospital/outpatient, and only 1.3% of ambulatory/office-based center procedures. On multivariable analysis, compared with hospital/inpatient, atherectomy use was associated with ambulatory/office-based center setting (Odds ratio 10.9, 95% confidence interval 10.3-11.5, P < 0.001) and hospital/outpatient setting (Odds ratio 1.57, 95% confidence interval 1.51-1.62, P < 0.001). Periprocedure complications including hematoma requiring intervention (0.3%), any stenosis/occlusion (0.2%), and distal embolization (0.6%) were quite low across all settings.
CONCLUSIONS: There are substantial variations in patient populations, procedural indications, and types of interventions undertaken during PVI across different locations. Ambulatory/office-based procedures more commonly treat claudicants, use atherectomy, and less often use stent grafts. Further research is warranted to investigate long-term trends in practice patterns and long-term outcomes, for PVI in the ever-expanding ambulatory/office-based setting.
