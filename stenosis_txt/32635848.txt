Title: [Diagnostic and Therapeutic Management of Carotid Artery Disease].

Abstract: Diagnostic and Therapeutic Management of Carotid Artery Disease Abstract. A quarter of all ischemic strokes is caused by atherosclerotic obliterations of the extra- and intracranial brain-supplying vessels. The prevalence of atherosclerotic extracranial carotid stenosis rises up to 6-15 % from the age of 65. The risk of stroke in symptomatic carotid stenosis, i.e. after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), is very high at 25 % within 14 days. Conservative therapy is the cornerstone of treatment by controlling the risk factors, treatment with platelet aggregation inhibitors and antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medication. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the first line treatment for symptomatic patients with a &gt;50 % and asymptomatic patients with a &gt;60 % carotid stenosis. In order to ensure the best possible treatment of patients with asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis, interdisciplinary cooperation in diagnostics, therapy and aftercare in a neuromedical centre of maximum care is necessary.
