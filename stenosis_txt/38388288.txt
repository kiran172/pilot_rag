Title: [Acute respiratory distress due to tracheostomy tube migration].

Abstract: Tracheostomy cannula care is of paramount importance in the daily management of tracheotomized patients. While some complications are commonplace, specific events can occur, often according to type of cannula. We herein report the case of a 71-year-old patient; following a lengthy stay in the intensive care unit, she had received a Safe T-Tube cannula designed to provide support in a stenotic trachea. At home, while suctioning her tracheal secretions, she suddenly experienced respiratory distress requiring a rapid intervention. On arrival, no seeable cannula was found, either in the tracheostomy or in the patient's immediate surroundings. Following her transfer to intensive care, a new cannula was inserted into the tracheostomy opening, enabling mechanical ventilation to begin and achieving rapid relief of dyspnea and improvement of the patient's overall condition. Bronchial fibroscopy was then performed, during which the Safe T-Tube cannula was found folded on itself in a supra-carinal intra-tracheal position. It was extracted and replaced by a cannula of the same model, which was sewn to the skin. Although rare and usually limited to flexible cannulas, this complication is potentially fatal. Generally speaking, when cannula obstruction is suspected, bronchial endoscopy in an intensive care setting is a vital necessity. It is not only the cornerstone of the diagnosis, but also of paramount importance in treatment taking into full account the mechanism of obstruction.
