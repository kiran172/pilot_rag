Title: An Anterior Dislocation after Mobi-C Cervical Disc Arthroplasty.

Abstract: The objective is to report a case of an early dislocation of Mobi-C prosthesis used for the replacement of C4-C5 disc. A 57-year-old man who was operated 17 years before for C6-C7 fusion complained of cervicalgia associated with bilateral but predominantly right-sided brachialgia. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated central and foraminal stenosis in the C5-C6 segment and soft medial disc herniation in the C4-C5 segment. The patient was indicated for the placement of a cervical disc prosthesis C4-C5 and a C5-C6 arthrodesis. After 1 month of clinical improvement, the patient saw his pain reappearing as well as the presence of dysphagia not objectified before. The patient did not describe a traumatic context. The radiographic assessment showed an anterior dislocation of the prosthesis. The patient was reoperated, the prosthesis was removed, and cervical arthrodesis with iliac graft was performed. Although rare, this complication must be well known by surgeons performing cervical arthroplasty.
