Title: New Horizons in Dialysis Access: Approach to Hand Ischemia.

Abstract: Hand ischemia is a relatively common complication of hemodialysis arteriovenous (AV) access. Clinical manifestations frequently start with pale and cold ipsilateral hand. Symptoms can progress to pain during dialysis and can eventually lead to tissue necrosis and gangrene if not addressed in a timely fashion. Comprehensive physical examination of the hand, AV access, and comparing it with the contralateral hand will assist in differentiating hand ischemia from carpal tunnel syndrome, osteoarthritis of the hand, and others. There are several treatment options for hand ischemia based on the severity of symptoms. Conservative management with careful monitoring can be applied in early stages. However, if symptoms persist or worsen, a full arteriogram of the ipsilateral extremity should be performed to evaluate for the presence of arterial stenosis. Angioplasty of the arterial stenosis, if present, will frequently lead to the resolution of symptoms. There are several percutaneous and surgical treatment options for hand ischemia, if no arterial stenosis was found or angioplasty does not relieve symptoms. We discuss in this article these treatment options in detail. Treatment goal is to improve hand ischemia symptoms while maintaining hemodialysis AV access and preserving patient's hand. Access ligation remains a treatment of last resort.
