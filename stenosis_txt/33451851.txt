Title: Surgery for laryngotracheal stenosis: Improved results.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal resection is still considered a challenging operation and few high-volume institutions have reported large series of patients in this setting. During the 5 years, novel surgical techniques as well as new trends in the intra- and postoperative management have been proposed. We present results of our increased experience with laryngotracheal resection for benign stenosis.
METHODS: Between 1991 and May 2019, 228 consecutive patients underwent laryngotracheal resection for subglottic stenosis. One hundred eighty-three (80.3%) were postintubation, and 45 (19.7%) were idiopathic. Most of them (58.7%) underwent surgery during the past 5 years. At the time of surgery, 139 patients (61%) had received tracheostomy, laser, or laser plus stenting. The upper limit of the stenosis ranged between actual involvement of the vocal cords to 1.5 cm from the glottis.
RESULTS: There was no perioperative mortality. Two hundred twenty-two patients underwent resection and anastomosis according to the Pearson technique; 6 patients with involvement of thyroid cartilage underwent resection and reconstruction with the laryngofissure technique. Airway resection length ranged between 1.5 and 8 cm (mean, 3.8 ± 0.8 cm) and it was >4.5 cm in 19 patients. Airway complication rate was 7.8%. Overall success of airway complication treatment was 83.3%. Definitive success was achieved in 98.7% of patients. Patients presenting with idiopathic stenosis or postcoma patients showed no increased failure rate.
CONCLUSIONS: Laryngotracheal resection for benign subglottic stenosis is safe and effective, and provides a very high rate of success. Careful intra- and postoperative management is crucial for a successful outcome.
