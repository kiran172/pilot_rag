Title: Outcomes After Transcatheter Mitral Valve-in-Valve Replacement in Patients With Degenerated Bioprosthesis: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study sought to describe a single center's experience with transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve (TM-ViV) implantation.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who had TM-ViV due to degenerative biological valve prosthesis at a single center during a 4-year period were identified from a prospectively maintained database. Operative outcomes were assessed both in-hospital and at 30 days. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes included valve function, functional status, and quality of life at follow-up.
RESULTS: Mean (± standard deviation) patient age was 69 ± 12 years and all patients were high risk for redo surgery (STS risk score, 9.6 ± 6.2%). The primary mechanism of bioprosthetic valve failure was stenosis in 7 patients (47%) and regurgitation in 8 patients (53%). Mean duration between mitral valve replacement (MVR) and transcatheter MVR was 89 months (range, 66-72 months). Failed bioprosthetic valves were replaced with Sapien XT (n = 10; 67%), Sapien (n = 4; 26%), or Sapien S3 valves (n = 1; 7%) (all valves manufactured by Edwards Lifesciences). Procedural success was 100%. No intraoperative deaths were recorded. Postimplantation valve hemodynamics was satisfactory, with a significant improvement in mean valvular gradient (Δ = -12 mm Hg; P<.001) and mitral valve area (Δ = 0.9 cm²; P<.01). At 30-day follow-up, no reports of death, disabling stroke, or rehospitalization for cardiac reasons was recorded. Health status scores were available for 11 of the 15 study patients (73%). Except for 1 patient, significant improvements were seen for all components of the health assessment survey.
CONCLUSIONS: TM-ViV for failing biological mitral prosthesis can be performed with minimal operative morbidity and acceptable mid-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes.
