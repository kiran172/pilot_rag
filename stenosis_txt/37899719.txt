Title: Deformation of transcatheter heart valves with mitral valve-in-valve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The use of oversizing in mitral valve-in-valve (MViV) procedures can lead to non-uniform expansion of transcatheter heart valves (THV). This may have implications for THV durability.
AIMS: The objective of this study was to assess the extent and predictors of THV deformation in MViV procedures.
METHODS: We examined 33 patients who underwent MViV with SAPIEN prostheses. The extent of THV deformation (deformation index, eccentricity, neosinus volume, asymmetric leaflet expansion and vertical deformation) and hypoattenuating leaflet thickening (HALT) were assessed using cardiac computed tomography (CT), performed prospectively at 30 days post-procedure. For descriptive purposes, the THV deformation index was calculated, with values >1.00 representing a more hourglass shape.
RESULTS: Non-uniform underexpansion of THV was common after MViV implantation, with a median expansion area of 74.0% (interquartile range 68.1-84.1) at the narrowest level and a THV deformation index of 1.21 (1.13-1.29), but circularity was maintained with eccentricity ranging from 0.24 to 0.28. The degree of oversizing was a key factor associated with greater underexpansion and a higher deformation index (β=-0.634; p<0.001; β=0.594; p<0.001, respectively). Overall, the incidence of HALT on the 30-day postprocedural CT was 27.3% (9 of 33). Most patients (32 of 33) were on anticoagulation therapy, but the prothrombin time and international normalised ratio (PT-INR) at the time of the CT scan was <2.5 in 23 of 32 patients. Among patients with a PT-INR of <2.5, HALT was predominantly observed with a high THV deformation index of ≥1.18.
CONCLUSIONS: THV deformation, i.e., underexpansion and an hourglass shape, commonly occurs after MViV implantation and is negatively affected by excessive oversizing. Optimising THV expansion during MViV could potentially prevent HALT.
