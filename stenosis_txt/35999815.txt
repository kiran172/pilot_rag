Title: A simple technique to repair distal and mid-shaft hypospadias using a de-epithelialized Byars' flap.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe standard and modified de-epithelialized Byars' flap techniques in tubularized incised plate urethroplasty and evaluate postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated data for 404 primary hypospadias repair patients who underwent standard (Group A) or modified (Group B) urethroplasty between January 2016 and 2021. Group B's data were analyzed to evaluate whether our modified technique was effective for all hypospadias types.
RESULTS: There was no difference in the ratio of different hypospadias types between Groups A (n = 145) and B (n = 259). Median follow-up duration was 35 months. Fistula occurred in 19 patients in Group A and 12 in Group B (statistically significant difference). The total complication rate was statistically significantly different between the groups. In Group B, 3/142 patients with distal hypospadias developed urethrocutaneous fistula vs 4/95 with mid-shaft hypospadias and 5/22 with proximal hypospadias. No difference was noted between the distal and mid-shaft groups. Significant differences were observed when comparing distal and mid-shaft groups with the proximal group; total complication rates were similar. Glans dehiscence and meatal stenosis rates were similar between Groups A and B, and among the hypospadias phenotypes.
CONCLUSION: Our modified procedure is simple to perform and yields excellent results in distal and mid-shaft hypospadias repair.
