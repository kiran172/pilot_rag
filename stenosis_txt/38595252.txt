Title: [Application of iliac vein molding and stent implantation through the ipsilateral great saphenous vein approach in daytime treatment mode].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the feasibility and recent efficacy of iliac vein molding and stenting in daytime treatment mode in patients with iliac vein stenosis.
METHODS: Medical records of iliac vein molding and stenting performed in the ipsilateral great saphenous vein approach conducted from February 2017 to March 2022 were retrospective reviewed. There were 21 cases, 6 males and 15 females. Age ranged from 37 to 79 years [(62.5 Â± 10.2) years]. The stenosis in the 21 limbs simply involved the common iliac veins in 16 patients, 2 patients had the simple and external iliac veins, and both the total and external iliac veins in 3 patients. Both iliac vein molding and iliac vein stenting were performed through the ipsilateral great saphenous vein approach. The patients with simple iliac vein stenosis with great saphenous vein valve insufficiency also underwent radiofrequency closure of great saphenous vein and flexural vein sclerosis therapy simultaneously. Regular postoperative direct oral anticoagulants therapy and stress therapy were followed. All the patients were hospitalized for less than 24 h.
RESULTS: All the 21 patients operations were successful (the success rate was 100%), without any intraoperative complications. Immediate postoperative complications were puncture point bleeding in 1 case. The bandage gauze was completely wet. The bleeding was stopped after 5min of recompression. All the patients were hospitalized for less than 24 h. Follow-up results: The 3-month follow-up rate after operation was 100%. Absolute effective 18 cases (18/21, 85.7%). Relatively effective(postmentation still after surgery, but with less extent) in 3 cases (3/21, 14.3%). The iliac vein stents were unobstructed, and the trunk of the great saphenous vein was well closed in the patients with great saphenous vein radiofrequency treatment. The 6-month follow-up rate after operation was 71.4%(15/21). Of these, 14 cases (14/15, 93.3%) were absolutely effective. Relatively effective(postmentation still after surgery, but with less extent) in 1 case (1/15, 6.7%). The iliac vein stents were no restenosis or obstruction, and the trunk of the great saphenous vein was well closed in the patients with great saphenous vein radiofrequency treatment.
CONCLUSION: The interventional treatment technique of iliac vein stenosis is feasible in the daytime treatment mode, with clear advantages and satisfactory recent efficacy.
