Title: Leaflet modification with the ShortCut™ device to prevent coronary artery obstruction during TAVR.

Abstract: Transcatheter heart valve (THV) procedures require careful planning and consideration to prevent coronary artery obstruction (CAO), which poses a significant and potentially life-threatening condition, especially in patients undergoing valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Despite identifying predictors of CAO and utilization of computed tomography and inputting THV features, a significant uncertainty remains in predicting CAO. The ShortCut™ device (Pi-Cardia, Rehovot, Israel) was purposefully designed to modify the leaflets in patients undergoing TAVR, especially prior to ViV procedures, to overcome the risk for CAO. This review aims to detail the device's objectives, structure, procedural steps, the available clinical data, and future directions for its intended utilization in the structural arena for the prevention of CAO.
