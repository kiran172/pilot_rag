Title: Lenticulostriate artery length and middle cerebral artery plaque as predictors of early neurological deterioration in single subcortical infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early neurological deterioration (END) is not a rare phenomenon in single subcortical infarction (SSI; traditionally known as lacunar infarction) patients. Predictors of END in SSI patients are uncertain.
AIMS: We aimed to investigate the association between infarct lesion characteristics, penetrating artery morphology, carrier artery plaque features and END using whole-brain vessel-wall imaging.
METHODS: We prospectively collected data from SSI patients without stenosis of the corresponding carrier artery. The infarct lesion size and location, lenticulostriate artery (LSA) morphological characteristics, and features of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) plaques involving M1 segment adjacent to LSA origin on the symptomatic side were compared between patients with or without END.
RESULTS: A total of 74 participants were enrolled, of whom 23 cases (31.1%) showed END. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and axial maximal diameter of infarct lesion revealed that the patients with MCA plaques adjacent to the LSA origin were more likely to develop END (odds ratio (OR) = 3.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.21-12.33), while with longer average length of LSAs were less likely to occur END (OR = 0.21, 95% CI = 0.05-0.92).
CONCLUSION: MCA plaques located adjacent to the LSA origin and average length of LSAs on the symptomatic side were independent predictors of END in SSI patients. This finding might provide new insights into the mechanisms of the neurological progression in SSI and facilitate therapeutic interventions.
