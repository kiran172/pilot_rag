Title: LncRNA NEAT1 correlates with Th17 cells and proinflammatory cytokines, also reflects stenosis degree and cholesterol level in coronary heart disease patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Long non-coding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (lnc-NEAT1) regulates endothelial cell functions, CD4+ T cell regulation and chronic inflammation related to coronary heart disease (CHD). Then this case-control study measured lnc-NEAT1 expression in CHD patients, aiming to explore its clinical value in CHD management.
METHODS: Totally, 120 documented CHD patients and 120 suspected subjects without CHD diagnosis as controls were enrolled. Plasma lnc-NEAT1 was detected by RT-qPCR in all participants, plasma inflammatory cytokines were assessed by ELISA, T helper (Th) 1, Th2, Th 17 cell proportions in CD4+ T cells were analyzed by flow cytometric analysis in CHD patients, respectively.
RESULTS: Lnc-NEAT1 was higher in CHD patients than in controls (p < 0.001). In CHD patients, lnc-NEAT1 positively associated with Gensini score (r = 0.323, p < 0.001). Besides, lnc-NEAT1 positively correlated with tumor necrosis factor-α (r = 0.271, p = 0.003), interleukin (IL)-1β (r = 0.216, p = 0.018), IL-6 (r = 0.217, p = 0.018) and IL-17 (r = 0.292, p = 0.001); meanwhile, it was positively associated with the percentage of Th 17 cells (r = 0.384, p = 0.002). However, no correlation was found in lnc-NEAT1 with the percentage of Th1 or Th2 cells (all p > 0.05). Moreover, lnc-NEAT1 was correlated with higher hyperuricemia prevalence (p = 0.028), increased total cholesterol (r = 0.263, p = 0.004) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.261, p = 0.004), but was not associated with other characteristics (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Lnc-NEAT1 correlates with Th17 cells and proinflammatory cytokines, also reflects stenosis degree and cholesterol level in CHD patients, which potentially improves the management of CHD patients.
