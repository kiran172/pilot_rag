Title: Acute Internal Carotid Artery Occlusion Long after Carotid Revascularization by Vein Graft.

Abstract: We report the case of a 27-year-old woman with acute internal carotid artery occlusion long after carotid artery revascularization by vein graft. She presented with sudden unconsciousness and left hemiparesis. Her right carotid artery was revascularized with an ipsilateral internal jugular vein graft during a carotid body tumor resection 10 years ago. Computed tomography angiography revealed a right internal carotid artery terminus occlusion. Intravenous rt-PA and mechanical thrombectomy were performed, resulting in successful recanalization. Her neurological symptoms gradually recovered. When examining the embolic source, carotid ultrasonography for the vein graft showed intimal thickening, some high-echoic plaques, and lumen dilation, but no thrombus was observed. Color Doppler imaging showed laminar flow at the graft. Angiography after thrombectomy also showed pooling of contrast at the vein graft. We suspected that the blood flow stagnation at the vein graft induced thrombus formation; therefore, anticoagulation therapy was initiated. One year later, she was independent without recurrence of stroke, and anticoagulation therapy was replaced with aspirin because she went abroad. However, a carotid ultrasonography exam the following year revealed a huge thrombus at the graft. Anticoagulation therapy was resumed; subsequently, the thrombus decreased. In conclusion, we could monitor the long-term change in the vein graft by ultrasonography. Moreover, anticoagulation therapy was more effective.
