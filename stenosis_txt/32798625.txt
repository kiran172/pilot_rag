Title: The impact of transcatheter aortic valve implantation on arterial stiffness and wave reflections.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The study of arterial properties in patients with aortic valve stenosis who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains challenging and results so far seem equivocal. We sought to investigate the acute and long-term effect of TAVI on arterial stiffness and wave reflections.
METHODS: We enrolled 90 patients (mean age 80.2 ± 8.1 years, 50% males) with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI. Arterial stiffness was assessed by carotid-femoral and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (cfPWV and baPWV). Augmentation index corrected for heart rate (AIx@75), central pressures and subendocardial viability ratio (SEVR) were assessed with arterial tonometry. Measurements were conducted at baseline, after TAVI and at 1 year.
RESULTS: Immediately after TAVI there was an increase in arterial stiffness (7.5 ± 1.5 m/s vs 8.4 ± 1.7 m/s, p = .001 for cfPWV and 1773 ± 459 vs 2383 ± 645 cm/s, p < .001 for baPWV) that was retained at 1 year (7.5 ± 1.5 m/s vs 8.7 ± 1.7 m/s, p < .001 and 1773 ± 459 cm/s vs 2286 ± 575, p < .001). Post-TAVI we also observed a decrease in AIx@75 (32.2 ± 12.9% vs 27.9 ± 8.4%, p = .016) that was attenuated 1 year later (32.2 ± 12.9% vs 29.8 ± 9.1%, p = .38), and an increase in SEVR (131.2 ± 30.0% vs 148.4 ± 36.1%, p = .002), which remained improved at 1 year (131.2 ± 30.0% vs 146.0 ± 32.2%, p = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: After TAVI the arterial system exhibits an increase of stiffness in response to the acute relief of the obstruction, which is retained in the long term.
