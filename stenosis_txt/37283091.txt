Title: Piccolo in transcatheter PDA closure multi-centre study from premature to adolescent children.

Abstract: In this multi-centre study, the mid- to long-term efficacy and safety of the Amplatzer Piccolo Occluder in patent ductus arteriosus closure in premature and term infants as well as children were discussed. Methods. Between 2016 and 2021, 645 patients, 152 of whom were less than 1 month old, underwent ductus closure with the Piccolo device from five different centres in Turkey. The median age of the patients was 2.2 years, and the mean narrowest point of duct diameter was 1.8 mm. Sixty-two patients weighed â‰¤ 1.5 kg, 90 patients 1.5-3 kg, and the mean follow-up was 20.4 months. In 396, the duct was closed by the retrograde route. Ductal anatomy was Type A in 285, C in 72, E in 171, and F in 64 patients. Fluoroscopy duration was 6.2 min. The procedure success rate was 99.1%. Device embolisation occurred in 13 patients (2%), and 11 were retrieved with a snare. Cardiac perforation and death developed in one premature baby. The left pulmonary artery and the descending aorta stenosis were observed in 3 (0.4%) and in 5 patients (0.5%). Results. Piccolo device is safe and effective in closing ductus in all age groups. It has low profile for use in premature and newborn babies, a small embolisation risk, and a low residual shunt rate after closure. Conclusion. The Piccolo device can be considered as close an ideal occluder. The lower profile, smaller delivery catheter size, and symmetry of this device allow for a venous or arterial approach.
