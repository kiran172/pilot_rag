Title: Important Notes for Preventing Entrapment of Distal Filter-based Embolic Protection Device in Carotid Artery Stenting.

Abstract: Failure to retrieve a distal filter-based embolic protection device (EPD) is a potential complication of carotid artery stenting. This may be caused by trapping of the proximal marker of the EPD within the stent tip marker. Maintaining an adequate distance between the two can prevent this. We examined the behavior of several stent-filter-based EPD combinations, focusing on their propensity to become trapped or disengage in vitro. Four physicians subjectively rated the force required to result in trapping using a 5-point scale. Moreover, the force required to disengage trapped devices was evaluated. The Casper stent-Spider FX EPD combination was difficult to disengage when entrapment occurred, which suggested that this phenomenon tended to occur with this combination. The stent tip marker of the closed-cell stents advanced as they shortened, which may be a unique feature of closed-cell stents. Although trapping is uncommon, it can cause serious complications. To prevent these complications, device characteristics should be well understood before they are used in patients.
