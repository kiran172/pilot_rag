Abstract: Lumbosciatica is a public health problem because of its socio-professional impact. The purpose of our study is to evaluate the indication for surgical treatment and the role of each technique used. We conducted a retrospective study in the Department of Orthopaedics in Tataouine. The study involved 44 patients with common lumbosciatica and having undergone surgical treatment over the period from 2013 to 2018. The information sheet included the epidemiological data and the clinical data. The patients underwent radiological assessment including lumbar spine x-ray (frontal and lateral views) and lumbar computed scan (CT) scan which clarified the cause of sciatica. Surgical treatment was indicated after medical treatment failure, in patients with hyperalgesia and in patients with neurological complication. In our study, herniated disc was the primary cause of lumbosciatica (50% of cases) followed by lumbar spinal stenosis (25%), spondylolisthesis (22.7%) and transverse mega-apophysis of L5 vertebrae (2.3%). Traditional discectomy was the most used technique for surgical treatment of herniated disc. Eight patients had spondylolisthesis. They underwent laminectomy associated with posterior arthrodesis. Lumbar spinal stenosis was treated with laminectomy alone in 54.54% of cases. Outcome was favorable during the follow up period in 90% of cases (Visual Analog Scale 3Â±1 at follow-up). Surgical technique depends on etiology and imaging data on which to base the choice of arthrodesis stages.
