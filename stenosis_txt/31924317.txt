Title: Relation Between Operator and Hospital Volumes and Long-Term Outcomes for Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in New York.

Abstract: Little is known about whether there is an inverse relation between provider volume and long-term adverse outcomes for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). For patients who underwent PCI procedures from December 2013 through November 2014 in New York, we examined a continuous relation and different annual PCI volume cut points at hospital and operator levels to investigate the relation between volume and 1-year adverse outcomes (mortality and mortality/acute myocardial infarction). There were 34,498 patients who underwent PCI procedures from 60 hospitals and 408 operators. We detected a significant continuous inverse association between 1-year mortality and annual hospital PCI volume. However, we did not find that there was a hospital volume and 1-year mortality relation for the 2013 ACCF/AHA/SCAI's hospital annual PCI volume cutoff value of 200 or a significant inverse operator volume-outcome relation using the operator annual PCI volume cutoff value of 50, or for any other practical volume cutoffs. Similar findings were obtained when we used the 1-year mortality/acute myocardial infarction outcome. We did find that providers in the highest volume quartile were associated with lower adverse outcome rates than providers in the lowest volume quartile. In conclusion, no significant volume-outcome relations were found between annual hospital or operator PCI volume and risk-adjusted 1-year outcomes for any practical volume cutoff values including 2013 Guidelines' recommended hospital/operator minimal annual PCI volumes. Providers in the highest annual volume quartile, however, were associated with lower adverse outcome rates than providers in the lowest volume quartile.
