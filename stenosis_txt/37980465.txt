Title: Novel mutation in ELN gene causes cardiac abnormalities and inguinal hernia: case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Elastin-driven genetic diseases are a group of complex diseases driven by elastin protein insufficiency and dominant-negative production of aberrant protein, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) and autosomal dominant cutis laxa. Here, a Chinese boy with a novel nonsense mutation in the ELN gene is reported.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a 1-year-old boy who presented with exercise intolerance, weight growth restriction with age, a 1-year history of heart murmur, and inguinal hernia. Gene sequencing revealed a novel nonsense mutation in the ELN gene (c.757 C > T (p.Gln253Ter), NM_000501.4). Due to severe branch pulmonary artery stenosis, the reconstruction of the branch pulmonary artery with autologous pericardium was performed. The inguinal hernia repair was performed 3 months postoperatively. After six months of outpatient follow-up, the child recovered well, gained weight with age, and had no special clinical symptoms.
CONCLUSION: We identified a de novo nonsense mutation in the ELN gene leading to mild SVAS and severe branch pulmonary artery stenosis. A new phenotype of inguinal hernia was also needed to be considered for possible association with the ELN gene. Still, further confirmation will be necessary.
