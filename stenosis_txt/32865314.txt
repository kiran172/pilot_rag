Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for severe pure aortic regurgitation due to active aortitis.

Abstract: Aortitis is an uncommon systemic inflammatory disease affecting the aorta and its main branches. Severe aortic regurgitation (AR) represents a fearsome complication of aortitis and is associated with an increased mortality rate. Surgical aortic valve replacement represents the only treatment choice for these patients. However, it is associated with a higher risk of medium to long-term complications such as prosthetic valve detachment. This is the first reported case where severe AR secondary to aortitis was managed with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). TAVI was safe and effective in this clinical setting and may be considered a viable alternative to high-risk surgery in these complex patients.
