Title: C. perfringens Blood Stream Infection due to Nontransmural Ischemia of the Esophagus, Stomach, and Left Colon: Case Report.

Abstract: We report the case of a 74-year-old female with abdominal pain, tarry stools, and tachycardia. Previous history included diabetes mellitus with micro- and macroangiopathy. Imaging revealed portal gas, left sided colitis, and emphysematous gastritis, besides severe atherosclerosis with subtotal celiac trunk occlusion and moderate stenosis of the inferior mesenteric artery. Upper endoscopy revealed findings consistent with focal necrotizing gastritis at the greater curvature and acute esophageal necrosis. Blood cultures immediately grew Clostridium perfringens. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics and was discharged after 21 days in the hospital. This case demonstrates the rare coincident occurrence of nontransmural ischemia of the left colon, the esophagus, and the stomach as a result of low-flow circulatory compromise, which then precipitated C. perfringens associated emphysematous gastritis and blood stream infection.
