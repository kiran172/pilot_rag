Title: Stent Retriever AssIsted Lysis Technique with Tirofiban: A Potential Bailout Alternative to Angioplasty and Stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Angioplasty and stent placement have been described as a bailout technique in individuals with failed thrombectomy. We aimed to investigate Stent retriever AssIsted Lysis (SAIL) with tirofiban before angioplasty and stent placement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients from 2 comprehensive stroke centers were reviewed (2020-2023). We included patients with failed thrombectomy and/or underlying intracranial stenosis who received SAIL with tirofiban before the intended angioplasty and stent placement. SAIL consisted of deploying a stent retriever through the occluding lesion to create a bypass channel and infuse 10 mL of tirofiban for 10 minutes either intra-arterially or IV. The stent retriever was re-sheathed before retrieval. The primary end points were successful reperfusion (expanded TICI 2b-3) and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. Additional end points included 90-day mRS 0-2 and mortality.
RESULTS: After a median of 3 (interquartile range, 2-4) passes, 44 patients received the SAIL bridging protocol with tirofiban, and later they were considered potential candidates for angioplasty and stent placement bailout (43.2%, intra-arterial SAIL). Post-SAIL successful reperfusion was obtained in 79.5%. A notable residual stenosis (&gt;50%) after successful SAIL was observed in 45.7%. No significant differences were detected according to post-SAIL: successful reperfusion (intra-arterial SAIL, 80.0% versus IV-SAIL, 78.9%; P = .932), significant stenosis (33.3% versus 55.0%; P = .203), early symptomatic re-occlusion (0% versus 8.0%; P = .207), or symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (5.3% versus 8.0%; P = .721). Rescue angioplasty and stent placement were finally performed in 15 (34.1%) patients (intra-arterial SAIL 21.0% versus IV-SAIL 44%; P = .112). At 90 days, mRS 0-2 (intra-arterial SAIL 50.0% versus IV-SAIL 43.5%; P = .086) and mortality (26.3% versus 12.0%; P = .223) were also similar.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with stroke in which angioplasty and stent placement are considered, SAIL with tirofiban, either intra-arterial or IV, seems to safely induce sustained recanalization, offering a potential alternative to definitive angioplasty and stent placement.
