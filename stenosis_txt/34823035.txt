Title: Long-term outcomes of photodynamic therapy for a positive resection margin after conization for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Positive resection margins after conization or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (conization/LEEP) are associated with increased risks of recurrence or residual cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). Herein, we investigated the long-term outcomes of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for incomplete excision of CIN3.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical charts of 73 patients treated with PDT between 2000 and 2011. Patients who underwent conization/LEEP before PDT within 6 months were included. The primary outcomes were the complete response (CR) rate after 1 year and human papillomavirus (HPV) eradication rate at 6 months after PDT.
RESULTS: A total of 34 patients with positive resection margins were finally enrolled. The median patient age was 33 years. Carcinoma in situ was diagnosed in 25 patients and CIN3 in 7 patients. The CR rate was 97.1% after 1 year. Except for one case of a persistent disease, there was no recurrence or newly developed disease during the median follow-up of 84 months (range, 12-224 months). The HPV eradication rate of PDT following conization/LEEP after 6 months was 96.9% (31/32). Photosensitivity was identified in five patients and cervical stenosis in one patient.
CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, PDT could be an effective therapeutic option for patients with a positive resection margin after conization/LEEP for CIN3. It could reduce the residual or recurrence rate of CIN lesions with tolerable adverse events.
