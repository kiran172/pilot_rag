Title: Abiotrophia defectiva Endocarditis Complicated by Stroke and Spinal Osteomyelitis.

Abstract: A 67-year-old male with coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and aortic valve replacement (AVR) presented after a two-day history of dizziness and frequent falls. Initially, he was found to have a subacute infarct of the left temporal lobe, osteomyelitis of the lumbar spine, and an aortic valve vegetation. Further investigations demonstrated gram-positive bacteremia, and, eventually, the causative organism was identified asÂ Abiotrophia defectiva. He was treated with penicillin and gentamicin in the inpatient setting and then discharged with outpatient intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone for the remainder of the four-week antibiotic course. He did not suffer complications after initiating therapy and recovered. We wish to raise awareness of the existence and complications that can result from A. defectiva endocarditis and encourage further research into effective antibiotic treatment. A. defectiva endocarditis may lead to neurological and orthopedic infective sequelae; understanding and awareness of Abiotrophia spp. infections are important to ensure effective treatment of endocarditis.
