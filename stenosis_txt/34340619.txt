Title: Case report: Flattening of the tectal plate in obstructive hydrocephalus with auto-ventriculostomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Obstructive hydrocephalus in adulthood can be caused by stenosis in the aqueductal area. Chronic changes lead to a dilatation of the lateral ventricles and ballooning of infratentorial recesses. In rare cases a rupture of the floor of the third ventricle (so-called spontaneous ventriculostomy) has been described in the literature.Case presentation: We present two cases of chronic obstructive hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis in adult patients. Magnetic resonance imaging included phase-contrast-imaging and revealed significant flow through the floor of the third ventricle in keeping with spontaneous ventriculostomy. In addition to other typical changes associated with chronic hydrocephalus, a distinct flattening of the tectal plate could be identified in one case.
CONCLUSION: We present two cases of spontaneous ventriculostomy in patients with chronic hydrocephalus. To our knowledge, flattening of the tectal plate has not yet been described in the literature and may be caused by continuous cerebrospinal fluid-pulsation.
