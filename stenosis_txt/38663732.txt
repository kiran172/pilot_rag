Title: Covered Stent Treatment for Direct Carotid-Cavernous Fistulas: A Meta-Analysis of Efficacy and Safety Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Direct carotid-cavernous fistulas (dCCFs) involve the abnormal shunting of blood between the internal carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. The use of covered stents (CSs) has been reported for the treatment of complex carotid artery lesions. However, the efficacy and safety of CS treatment for dCCFs remain controversial. Thus, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate these efficacy and safety endpoints.
METHODS: A systematic literature review was performed by comprehensively searching the Medline, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify studies that were related to CS treatment for dCCFs. Then, a meta-analysis was conducted to pool the efficacy and safety outcomes from these studies based on perioperative and follow-up data.
RESULTS: Fourteen noncomparative studies enrolling 156 patients with 160 dCCFs met the inclusion criteria. When analyzing perioperative outcomes, the technical success rate was 98.5% [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.948; 1.000], and the immediate complete occlusion rate was 90.9% (95% CI, 0.862; 0.959). Vasospasm and dissection occurred in 32.2% (95% CI, 0.238; 0.463) and 0.1% (95% CI, 0.000; 0.012) of patients, respectively. The in-stent acute thrombus formation rate was 0.1% (95% CI, 0.000; 0.013). Postoperatively, the mortality rate was 0.1% (95% CI, 0.000; 0.013). Based on available follow-up data, the final complete occlusion and parent artery stenosis rates were 99.3% (95% CI, 0.959; 1.000) and 18.6% (95% CI, 0.125; 0.277), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: CS placement can be used to safely and effectively treat dCCFs. These results provide a reference for future clinical trials.
