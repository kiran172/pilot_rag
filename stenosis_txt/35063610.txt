Title: Effect of routine intracerebral completion angiography on outcomes after transcarotid artery revascularization.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Completion cerebral angiography (CCA) after transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has been used to identify distal embolization after stenting and serve as a measure of intraoperative quality control. Nevertheless, no general evidence has been reported regarding the benefit of performing routine CCA. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the potential risks and benefits of routine CCA.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the Vascular Quality Initiative database for TCAR from 2016 to 2021. The patients were divided into two groups: those with no CCA performed and those with CCA performed. The primary outcome was in-hospital stroke or death. The secondary outcomes included stroke, death, myocardial infarction, and a return to the operating room (RTOR). Clinically relevant and statistically significantly variables on univariable analysis were added to a logistic regression model clustered by center identifier.
RESULTS: A total of 18,155 patients who had undergone TCAR were identified, of whom 11,607 (63.7%) had undergone routine CCA. The patients with routine CCA were more likely to have contralateral carotid occlusion and to have received general anesthesia. After adjusting for potential confounders, we found no differences in the risk of stroke/death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.03; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.3; P = .820), stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA; aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.8-1.3; P = .998), stroke (aOR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.8-1.4; P = .452), death (aOR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.6-1.6; P = .953), myocardial infarction (aOR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.5-1.2; P = .240), or RTOR (aOR, 1.5; 95% CI, 0.6-3.8; P = .412) between patients who had undergone CCA and those who had not. A subanalysis of the patients with new occlusions detected by CCA (69 patients [0.6%]; 19 not treated and 50 treated) indicated a higher risk of stroke/death for the patients with treated new occlusions (aOR, 7.1; 95% CI, 2.9-17.3; P < .001) and stroke/TIA (aOR, 5.8; 95% CI, 2.3-14.7; P < .001) than for the patients who had not undergone CCA. However, no differences were found in stroke/death (aOR, 3.3; 95% CI, 0.37-29.5; P = .283) or stroke/TIA (aOR, 3.1; 95% CI, 0.3-29.4; P = .327) for patients with nontreated new occlusions compared with patients who had not undergone CCA.
CONCLUSIONS: In the present retrospective study, routine performance of CCA was not beneficial, with no significant differences in in-hospital stroke or death detected. The detection of new lesions on CCA was rare. Moreover, identifying new occlusions using CCA was associated with higher odds of stroke or death when these new lesions were treated. Further studies are needed to define the etiology of the worse outcomes for patients undergoing intervention for lesions discovered using CCA and delineate the optimal timing for further imaging and intervention.
