Title: Left Pulmonary Artery Aneurysm: A Post-stenotic Pulmonary Aneurysm Related to Pulmonary Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Aneurysms of the pulmonary artery are uncommon vascular pathologies that are associated with congenital structural cardiac anomalies, pulmonary hypertension, vasculitis, neoplasm, iatrogenic, and infection. PAAs are commonly asymptomatic and accidentally diagnosed, however, if symptomatic, clinical features are generally non-specific and depend on the etiology of PAA. CT pulmonary angiography remains the gold standard imaging modality and other diagnostic imaging tests include transthoracic echocardiography and right heart catheterization. Definitive treatment of PAA is surgery, however, conservative management with close monitoring should be practiced in patients with poor surgical candidates or surgery is unlikely to improve survival. Here, we report a case of pulmonary artery aneurysm secondary to congenital pulmonary valve stenosis as well as a brief review of the literature regarding pulmonary artery aneurysms.
