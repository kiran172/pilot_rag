Title: Innominate Arterial Barrier Blocked a 25-Year Substernal Neoesophagus.

Abstract: A 67-year-old woman underwent esophagogastroduodenectomy, partial jejunectomy, pancreaticojejunostomy, cervical esophagostomy, and feeding jejunostomy at the age of 42 for corrosive necrosis. She underwent esophageal reconstruction using the ileocolon through the substernal route 4 months later. Twenty-five years after esophageal reconstruction, the proximal part of the neoesophagus was obstructed by the innominate artery barrier. She could eat regular diets after revision surgery.
