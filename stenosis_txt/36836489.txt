Title: Association of CT-Derived Extracardiac Features and Aortic Annulus Size in Patients Planned for TAVI.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is commonly used to treat patients with stenosed aortic valves. CT is one of the crucial steps in planning TAVI to obtain measurements of the aortic annulus to choose an appropriately sized prosthesis. Incorrect measurements can lead to patient-prosthesis mismatch and other complications. However, some patients cannot undergo ECG-gated CT with radiocontrast because of the presence of radiopaque objects in the thorax, arrhythmia, renal failure, etc. Aim: To explore supplementary methods to improve aortic annulus sizing for TAVI by extracardiac measurements.
METHODS: We included all patients who underwent CT as part of TAVI planning. Measurements of femoral and iliac arteries and the femoral head cross-sectional area were performed.
RESULTS: CT scans of 139 patients were included in this study. Sixty-three patients (45%) were males. Mean age of the female patients was 79.6 ± 7.1 years and of the male patients was 81.3 ± 6.1 years. Mean aortic annulus perimeter among female patients was 74.3 ± 6 mm (range 61.9-88.2) and 83 ± 7.9 mm among male patients (range 70.1-74.3 mm). Mean diameters of common iliac, external iliac, and common femoral arteries were 9.2 ± 1.8, 7.6 ± 1, 7.6 ± 1 mm, respectively, for females and 10.2 ± 1.8, 8.5 ± 1.3, and 8.6 ± 1.4 mm for males. Mean perimeter of the femoral head (average value of right and left femoral heads) among the female patients was 137.8 ± 6.3 mm, and among male patients was 155 ± 9.6 mm. A significant correlation was observed between the perimeter of the aortic annulus and the perimeter of the femoral head (Pearson's R2 = 0.224). The correlation between the aortic annulus perimeter and the femoral head perimeter was stronger among men than among women (Pearson's R2 = 0.66 and 0.19, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Femoral head diameter is associated with annulus size. This may help size the appropriate prosthesis in cases where the measurements by CT are in the border zone if corroborated by clinically driven data.
