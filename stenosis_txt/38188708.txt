Title: An Unusual Hemodynamic Pressure Trace Mimicking Aortic Stenosis: A Decepti "Con".

Abstract: We report an abnormal hemodynamic pressure tracing taken during pullback from the left ventricle. This report emphasizes the careful observation of hemodynamic tracing relative to continuous electrocardiographic monitoring for identifying potentially pathological vascular phenomena that may have detrimental outcomes on the clinical management of the underlying condition.
