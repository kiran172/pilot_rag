Title: Incidents and risk factors of biliary complications after orthotropic liver transplantation.

Abstract: Biliary complications (BC) especially stenosis and strictures are the most common complications after orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) procedure in adult recipients. The intention of this study was analyzed BC in 273 patients after OLT for the last 4 years in our department.Retrospective study of 273 patients underwent cadaveric donor liver transplantation between January 2014 and December 2017. Most of them (n = 268) have anastomosed bile duct in end to end, rest of them (n = 5) underwent hepaticojejunostomy. Statistical analysis was performed using Fischer exact test and Student t test. A P value <.05 was considered significant.BC were developed in 48/273 transplants (17.6%). The most frequent was biliary stricture (n = 42, 87.5%) followed by bile leak (n = 4, 8.3%) and choledocholitiasis (n = 2, 4.2%). Treatment was usually using endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Recipients with hypotension during and after OLT treated by norepinephrine have a higher index of BC.Self-expanding metal stents implantation seems to be more effective than repeated balloon dilatation of anastomotic strictures with subsequent plastic biliary stent placement and associated with similar complication rate. Good fluid management against inotropic therapy may reduce risk of BC.
