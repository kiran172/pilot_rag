Title: Characteristics of cerebral ischemic stroke based on moyamoya disease and atherosclerosis-associated intracranial arterial stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To analyze the characteristics of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) resulting from moyamoya disease (MMD) and intracranial large artery atherosclerotic stenosis (LAS).
METHOD: This real-world case control study enrolled imaging-confirmed AIS patients owing to MMD or LAS hospitalized from January 2015 through September 2020 consecutively. The features of risk factors, peripheral blood, and imaging presentations were compared between the two cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 191 eligible patients entered into final analysis, including 70 cases with MMD stroke and 121 with LAS stroke. LAS stroke vs. MMD stroke, the ratios of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperhomocysteinemia were higher in the former (65.3 vs.12.9%, 65.3% vs. 4.3%, 39.7% vs. 2.9%, and 43.8% vs.12.9%; all p < 0.01) as well as baseline plasma arachidonic acid (AA) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-stimulated maximum platelet aggregation rates (75.3% vs. 60.8% and 73.1% vs.64.9%, respectively, all p < 0.01), which were positively correlated with triglycerides and cholesterol levels, blood glucose, age, and platelet counts (all p < 0.01). Classical watershed infarction (WSI) accounted for 87.14% in MMD stroke and 40.49% in LAS stroke, respectively (p < 0.01). Almost all of the patients with LAS showed plaques in arterial walls on CTA maps and non-homogeneous thickening with irregular luminal narrowing on HRMRI, while plaques were seldom found in MMD besides homogeneous thickening with regular luminal narrowing.
CONCLUSIONS: Differing from LAS stroke, MMD stroke mainly presents with WSI and does not feature with platelet hyper-aggregation and fragmentation of ulcer plaque. Whereby, focusing on perfusion improvement rather than antiplatelets and statins may be the predominant step in MMD-stroke correction.
