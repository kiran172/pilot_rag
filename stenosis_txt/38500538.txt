Title: Diagnostic Contexts of Echocardiographic Nonapical Window.

Abstract: The long-established utility of multiwindow interrogation in echocardiography (suprasternal notch, right and left sternal border, apex, and subxiphoid) is sometimes not systematically implemented in routine practice. This case series emphasizes the pivotal importance of such practice for the systematic assessment of aortic valve stenosis and in the evaluation of left ventricular outflow tract and the aorta.
