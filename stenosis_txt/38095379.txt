Title: Assessment of efficacy of percutaneous epidural neuroplasty for lumbar stenosis and failed back surgery syndrome: effective and safe?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Chronic, refractory low back and lower extremity pain is a common problem. There are many causes for persistent low back pain, including spinal stenosis (SS), disc herniation, facet disease, sacroiliac disease, adjacent segment disease, ligamentous disease, and failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). FBSS and SS are common and often result in chronic, persistent pain and disability. After the failure of conservative treatments, percutaneous epidural neuroplasty (PEN) is often used in managing low back pain.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 117 patients who received PEN for FBSS and SS between January 2018 and January 2019. Clinical outcomes were assessed with the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the Oswestry disability index (ODI). The follow-up period was 6 months. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural neuroplasty in managing chronic refractory low back and lower extremity pain secondary to FBSS and SS and to compare the differences between outcomes of SS and FBSS groups, before and after PEN.
RESULTS: Mean VAS scores were 6.15 ± 1.25 preoperatively, 2.97 ± 1.5 after 1 month, 3.18 ± 1.65 after 3 months, and 3.83 ± 1.64 after 6 months of follow-up. Mean ODI scores were 49.91 ± 13.87 preoperatively, 30.19 ± 12.01 after 1 month, 31.61 ± 12.46 after 3 months, 34.58 ± 12.52 after 6 months of follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous epidural neuroplasty was shown to be a safe and effective treatment in managing refractory back/leg pain following FBSS and SS.
