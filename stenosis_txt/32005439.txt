Title: Thirty-Day Readmission After Medical Versus Endovascular Therapy for Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Whether renal artery stenting (RAS) confers benefit over medical therapy (MT) alone in patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis admitted with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), congestive heart failure (CHF), or hypertensive crisis remains unknown. We identified a nationally-weighted cohort of 116,056 patients from the Nationwide Readmissions Database with a preexisting diagnosis of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and an index hospitalization diagnosis of ACS, CHF, or hypertensive crisis, and propensity-matched on the likelihood of undergoing inpatient RAS. Thirty-day readmission rates, index hospitalization complications, hospital lengths-of-stay, and cost were compared between treatment groups. Overall, all-cause, nonelective 30-day readmission rates did not differ between RAS and MT alone (18.2% vs 18.7%, respectively, p = 0.49). RAS was associated with higher index rates of acute kidney injury, major bleeding, transfusion, and vascular complications, and were similar irrespective of index hospitalization diagnosis. Index hospitalization length of stay (6 vs 4 days; p <0.001) and cost ($23,020 vs. $11,459; p <0.001) were higher with RAS. In conclusion, nearly 1-in-5 patients hospitalized with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and ACS, CHF, or hypertensive crisis were readmitted within 30-days. Index hospitalization complications occurred more frequently among those treated with RAS than MT alone, but the likelihood of readmission did not differ by treatment strategy.
