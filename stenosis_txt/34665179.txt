Title: Perpendicular duodenum jejunum anastomosis for conventional postoperative endoscopic access in biliodigestive diversions in Roux in Y.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cholecystectomy is one of the most performed abdominal surgical procedures, with approximately 1.5 million procedures performed annually in the United States of america. Most of the biliary duct injuries during laparoscopic cholecystectomy are due to a wrong perception of the anatomy. Two thirds of postsurgical stenosis develop within two and three years after repairing and the other third in the following ten years.
OBJECTIVE: To show the adequacy for postoperative endoscopic access in Roux-in-Y biliodigestive diversions.
METHOD: The best technique to repair biliary duct injuries is the Roux-in-Y hepaticojejunostomy or choledochojejunostomy, from this procedure we propose a surgical technique that consists to perform a perpendicular anastomosis between the defunctionalized jejunum loop and the duodenum for later endoscopic access of the Roux-en-Y biliodigestive diversion.
RESULTS: The duodenal-jejunal perpendicular anastomosis procedure was performed in four patients with Roux-Y biliodigestive diversion.
CONCLUSIONS: With the technique that is proposed, we have that advantage of keeping the anastomosis permanently open due to its rhomboidal design and because of the pylorus is kept intact alkaline reflux would not be a problem.
