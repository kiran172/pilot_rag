Title: TAV-in-TAV in patients with prosthesis embolization: Impact of commissural alignment and global outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Optimal strategies to manage embolization of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) devices are unclear; valve-in-valve (ViV) is often used. We aimed to describe through one-single center experience its rate, causes, consequences, and management as well as the rate and relevance of commissural alignment (CA) in this context.
METHODS: We identified across 1038 TAVI cases, those cases requiring ViV for the management of first device embolization. CA (absence or mild misalignment) after first and second device was assessed by CT or fluoroscopy.
RESULTS: A total of 23 cases (2.2%) were identified, 52.3% embolized towards the aorta and 47.7% towards the ventricle. Suboptimal implant height (38%) and embolization at the time of post-dilation (23%) were the most frequent mechanisms together with greater rate of bicuspid valve (p < 0.001) and a trend to greater annular eccentricity. Procedural and 1-year death occurred in 13% and 34%, respectively (vs. 1.1% and 7.8% in the global cohort, p < 0.001). CA was present in 76.9% of the prostheses initially implanted but was only spontaneously achieved in 30.8% of the second ViV device. Adequate CA of both prostheses was identified in only two cases (8.7%). There were no cases of coronary obstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI device embolization mechanisms can often be predicted and prevented. Mortality following bail-out ViV is higher than in regular TAVI procedures but 2/3 of these patients survived beyond 1-year follow-up. In them, valve degeneration or coronary re-access might be particularly challenging since CA was rarely achieved with both devices suggesting that greater efforts should be made in this regard.
