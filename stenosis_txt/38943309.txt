Title: Swallowing rehabilitation of patients undergoing T-tube implantation for the treatment of laryngotracheal stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients with laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) often have dysphagia after laryngotracheal reconstruction with T-tube insertion, which affects the quality of life. The purpose of this study is to observe the effect of swallowing rehabilitation therapy on the improvement of quality of life in patients of otolaryngology-head and neck surgery with dysphagia undergoing T-tube implantation treatment through longitudinal study.
METHODS: Thirty-eight patients with LTS who experienced dysphagia after laryngotracheal reconstruction and T-tube implantation were recruited. All patients received swallowing rehabilitation therapy. The assessment of swallowing function was performed using the 10-item Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10), the 30 mL water swallow test (WST), and flexible endoscopic evaluation of swallow (FEES).
RESULTS: After swallowing rehabilitation therapy, timing of swallowing, grade of dysphagia, performance on FEES and 30 mL WST, and EAT-10 score all improved. Thirty-eight patients successfully transitioned to oral feeding and were able to remove their nasogastric tubes without experiencing any complications, including aspiration pneumonia.
CONCLUSION: For patients with LTS who experienced dysphagia after laryngotracheal reconstruction and T-tube implantation, swallowing rehabilitation therapy could improve swallowing function of the patients, so as to reduce the potential harm caused by the pain and complications of surgery experienced by patients.
