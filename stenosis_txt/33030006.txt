Title: [Frozen elephant trunk procedure for DeBakey type i acute aortic dissection complicated by lower limb malperfusion].

Abstract: Two-stage surgical treatment of a patient with type I acute aortic dissection and lower limb malperfusion is reported in the manuscript. Frozen elephant trunk procedure was applied. A 49-year-old man was hospitalized with a diagnosis of «Debakey type I acute aortic dissection» in 7 hours after manifestation of the disease. At admission, paleness and numbness of both lower limbs with a violation of active movements were observed in addition to pain syndrome. Chest CT revealed false lumen thrombosis within the distal aorta followed by stenosis of aortic bifurcation up to 80% and stenosis of the right common iliac artery up to 80%. Considering critical lower limb ischemia, axillo-bifemoral bypass surgery was performed at the first stage. A day later, the patient underwent replacement of ascending aorta, aortic arch and descending thoracic aorta. E-vita Open Plus № 24 hybrid prosthesis and frozen elephant trunk procedure under hypothermia 25o C with bilateral antegrade cerebral perfusion were used. CPB time was 285 min, aortic cross-clamping time - 180 min, circulatory arrest - 135 min. Postoperative period was uneventful, ICU-stay - 5 days. The patient was discharged after 20 days. Control CT confirmed false lumen thrombosis throughout the stent-graft. Follow-up survey after 1 year revealed no complaints.
