Title: Effect of concomitant aortic regurgitation on early hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We hypothesize that different degree of pre-existing aortic regurgitation (AR) may affect the presence of hypo-attenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: The mechanism of the presence of HALT post-TAVR is not fully understood.
METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated the post-procedural multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) before discharge for evidence of HALT. Patients were grouped according to the degree of pre-existing AR. Baseline, native anatomy and procedure details were compared, then multivariate regression was performed.
RESULTS: MSCT analyzed was performed at a median of 6 days post-TAVR in 179 patients. HALT was detected in 10.6% of patients. After adjusting for variables that were significantly different between groups, pre-existing ≥ moderate AR was protective to the risk of HALT (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.84, p = .03). Stratifying for factors that might explain the impact of pre-existing AR on HALT, patients with a small Sinus of Valsalva, non-eccentric remodeling and receiving a large bioprosthesis experienced a sevenfold higher risk for HALT (OR 7.16, 95% CI 2.05-25.08, p = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients underwent TAVR with pre-existing ≥ moderate AR appeared to experience a lower incidence of early HALT compared to those patients with less than moderate AR, which may be explained by a larger Sinus of Valsalva and a higher proportion of LV eccentric remodeling.
