Title: Beyond 30 Days: Analysis of Unplanned Readmissions During the First Year Following Congenital Heart Surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We investigated the incidence and etiologies for unplanned hospital readmissions during the first year following congenital heart surgery (CHS) at our institution and the potential association of readmissions with longer term survival.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 263 patients undergoing CHS at our institution from August 2011 to June 2015. Scheduled readmissions were excluded.
RESULTS: Seventy patients accrued a total of 120 readmissions (1.7 readmission/patient) within one year after surgery. The first readmission for 57% of the patients was within 30 days postdischarge. Twenty-two patients were first readmitted between 31 and 90 days postdischarge. Eight patients were first readmitted between 90 days and 1 year postdischarge. Median time-to-first readmission was 21 days. Median hospital length of stay at readmission was two days. Causes of 30-day readmissions included viral illness (25%), wound infections (15%), and cardiac causes (15%). Readmissions between 30 and 90 days included viral illness (27%), gastrointestinal (27%), and cardiac causes (9%). Age, STAT category, length of surgery, intubation, intensive care unit, and hospital stay were risk factors associated with readmissions based on logistic regression. Distance to hospital had a significant effect on readmissions (P &lt; .001). Patients with higher family income were less likely to be readmitted (P &lt; .001). There was no difference in survival between readmitted and non-readmitted patients (P = .68).
CONCLUSIONS: The first 90 days is a high-risk period for unplanned hospital readmissions after CHS. Complicated postoperative course, higher surgical complexity, and lower socioeconomic status are risk factors for unplanned readmissions the first 90 days after surgery. Efforts to improve the incidence or readmission after CHS should extend to the first 3 months after surgery and target these high-risk patient populations.
