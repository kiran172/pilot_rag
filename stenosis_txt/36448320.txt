Title: Endoscopic ultrasound-assisted rendezvous by transgastric approach in malignant extrahepatic bile duct stricture.

Abstract: Endoscopic ultrasonography rendezvous (EUS-RV) is useful in cases of difficult deep biliary cannulation. However, in malignant extrahepatic bile duct strictures (MEHBDS), transduodenal routes are challenging and the transgastric approach often requires fistula dilation. We report a case of resectable MEHBDS in which transgastric puncture from the antrum of the stomach as EUS-RV was useful.
