Title: An Unexpected Free-Floating Aortic Valve Leaflet Avulsion in the Left Atrium on Transesophageal Echocardiography During Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Under Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation.

Abstract: • Aortic valve leaflet avulsion is a rare complication during TAVI. • Avulsed leaflet traveled to the LA with ECMO flow and migrated to the aorta. • TEE aided in timely management and helped complete the transcatheter intervention.
