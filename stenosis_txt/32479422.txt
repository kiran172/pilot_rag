Title: Technical Considerations for TAVR in the Treatment of Stentless Bioprosthetic Aortic Valve Insufficiency in LVAD Patients.

Abstract: An 80-year-old man with a history of bicuspid AV complicated by severe AI presented with progressive NYHA class III symptoms and severe bioprosthetic AV insufficiency. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement was planned via transfemoral approach. We encountered several technical challenges and describe them herein.
