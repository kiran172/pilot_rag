Title: An usually early presentation of peripheral arterial disease in a 30-year-old woman.

Abstract: Peripheral vascular disease is commonly thought to be a disease of elderly patients. However, with certain environmental factors and predetermined genetics, it can present much earlier in life. This case report demonstrates a case of severe peripheral vascular disease in a 30-year-old woman with an 11-year history of smoking. We report the case of a 30-year-old woman who presented to our clinic with a 9-year history of peripheral vascular disease. She complained of worsening claudication in both lower extremities and intermittent pain at rest. A CT arteriogram was conducted and showed significant stenosis of both left and right iliac arteries, as well as stenosis of the distal aorta. In the setting of certain genetic and environmental factors, the presentation of peripheral vascular disease can occur significantly earlier in life.
