Title: Covered endovascular reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation with inferior mesenteric artery chimney for management of bilateral lower extremity tissue loss with concomitant mesenteric stenosis.

Abstract: Aortoiliac occlusive disease involving mesenteric branches poses an interesting challenge. Although an open surgical approach is considered the gold standard, endovascular techniques such as covered endovascular reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation with inferior mesenteric artery chimney have been presented as alternatives for patients unfit for major surgical repair. A 64-year-old man with bilateral chronic limb-threatening ischemia and severe chronic malnutrition underwent covered endovascular reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation with inferior mesenteric artery chimney due to significant intraoperative risk. We have presented the operative technique used. The intraoperative course was successful, and, postoperatively, the patient underwent successful, planned, left below-the-knee amputation and his right lower extremity wounds healed.
