Title: Clinical Implication of Supra-Normal Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Individuals with heart failure displaying supra-normal left ventricular ejection fraction (snLVEF) may exhibit less favorable clinical outcomes in contrast to their counterparts with normal left ventricular ejection fraction (nLVEF). The distinctive characteristics and mid-term prognosis of individuals with severe aortic stenosis and snLVEF following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remain enigmatic.
METHODS: Among 7393 patients diagnosed with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR between 2013 and 2019 and were enlisted in the optimized transcatheter valvular intervention (OCEAN-TAVI) multicenter registry (UMIN000020423), we selected patients with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 50%. snLVEF was defined as LVEF exceeding 65%. We compared the baseline characteristics and assessed three-year post-TAVR mortality and heart failure readmission rates between the snLVEF (LVEF > 65%) and nLVEF cohorts (LVER 50-65%).
RESULTS: Our study cohort comprised 5989 patients (mean age 84.4 ± 5.1 years and 1783 males). Among these, 2819 patients were categorized within the snLVEF cohort, while the remaining 3170 were allocated to the nLVEF group. Individuals within the snLVEF cohort were more likely to be female and displayed lower levels of natriuretic peptides, as well as smaller left ventricular dimensions in comparison to their nLVEF counterparts (p &lt; 0.05 for all). The presence of snLVEF emerged as an independent predictor of the three-year composite endpoint relative to nLVEF, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.16 (95% confidence interval 1.02-1.31, p = 0.023) after accounting for several potential confounding factors.
CONCLUSIONS: snLVEF was relatively common among candidates for TAVR with preserved ejection fraction. Patients harboring snLVEF appear to manifest a distinctive clinical profile and encounter less favorable clinical outcomes following TAVR in contrast to those characterized by nLVEF.
