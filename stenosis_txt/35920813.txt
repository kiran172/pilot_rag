Title: Valve implantation for successful sealing of a balloon predilatation-induced annular rupture during transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Annular rupture is a rare and dreaded complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and even rarer when caused by predilatation balloon aortic valvuloplasty. This complication often presents as sudden cardiac tamponade with hypotension and requires urgent intervention. The traditional rescue strategy for patients with annular rupture is emergency surgical repair. However, the mortality rate is still high, considering that most patients who undergo TAVR are not candidates for conventional cardiac surgery. Therefore, there is a need for additional emergency treatment strategies to decrease mortality. This report describes a case of predilatation-induced annular rupture during TAVR that was successfully sealed at the rupture site by valve implantation. This case suggests that continuing with valve deployment may be a successful treatment for predilatation-induced annular rupture during TAVR.
