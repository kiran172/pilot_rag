Title: Pulmonary vein reconstruction for pulmonary vein stenosis and occlusion after surgical ablation.

Abstract: Acquired pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis (PVS) is a complication following cardiac catheter intervention. However, very few cases of PVS after surgical ablation have been reported. We herein report a case of stenosis and occlusion at the left atrium to each pulmonary vein after surgical ablation. A 73-year-old woman who had received aortic valve replacement and pulmonary vein isolation 10Â months earlier was diagnosed with congestive heart failure accompanied by pulmonary hypertension. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed stenosis and complete occlusion of the left atrium to all four pulmonary veins. Surgical repair was performed via pericardial patch reconstruction of the left atrium to each PV. Treating multiple PV lesions with involvement of the left atrium wall requires tailored methods. However, there have been few reports concerning such methods of reconstruction. We herein report a method of reconstructing the left atrium and pulmonary veins at the same time.
