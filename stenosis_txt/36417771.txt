Title: Which Patients Receive Diagnostic Angiography? An EAST Multicenter Study Analysis of Internal Carotid Artery Blunt Cerebrovascular Injury.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the gold standard radiologic modality in blunt cerebrovascular injury (BCVI). However, computerized tomography angiography (CTA) is primarily used in modern practice with CTA's widespread availability and the decreased stroke rate with CTA use. The frequency and indications for DSA in BCVI is undefined. We hypothesized that DSA use in internal carotid artery (ICA) BCVI would be infrequent and dependent on radiologic features.
METHODS: This was a post hoc analysis of an EAST multicenter, prospective, observational trial of 16 trauma centers for stroke factors in BCVI. ICA BCVI was divided into those undergoing DSA and not undergoing DSA (no-DSA). Only ICA BCVI was included.
RESULTS: 332 ICA BCVI were included, 221 (66.6%) no-DSA and 111 (33.4%) DSA. Lower hospital trauma volume, non-urban environment, and non-academic status were associated with DSA use (all P ≤ .001). BCVI grade (P = .02) and presence of luminal stenosis (P = .005) were associated with DSA use while pseudoaneurysm presence was not. Median time to DSA was 1 hour. The most common indication for angiography was to determine the presence of injury in 71 (64%) ICA BCVI, followed by determining grade of injury in 16 (14.4%) and concerning imaging characteristics in 12 (10.8%). BCVI grade on initial imaging and on DSA were equivalent in 94 (84.7%) ICA BCVI.
DISCUSSION: DSA is frequently used in ICA BCVI, primarily early in the hospital course for injury diagnosis and grade determination. DSA appears primarily driven by hospital type, BCVI grade, and luminal stenosis.
