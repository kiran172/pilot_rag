Title: Administration of oral prednisolone to prevent esophageal stricture after balloon-type radiofrequency ablation for ultralong-segment esophageal neoplasia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Endoscopic radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has shown good efficacy and safety in eradicating flat-type early esophageal squamous cell neoplasia (ESCN). However, post-RFA stricture is still a major concern, especially when treating ultralong-segment ESCNs. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral prednisolone to prevent post-RFA stricture.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 48 patients treated with balloon-type RFA who had Lugol-unstained or mosaic-like flat-type ESCNs with an expected treatment area of >10 cm. Oral prednisolone was started at a dose of 30 mg/day on the third day after RFA and continued for 4 weeks. The results were compared with an historical control group of 25 patients who received RFA without oral steroids. The primary endpoint was the frequency of post-RFA stricture. Secondary endpoints were the number of balloon dilation sessions and adverse event rate.
RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the worst pathology grade at baseline and length of unstained lesions between the 2 groups. The complete response rates after 1 session of RFA were 73% and 72%, respectively. Compared with the control group, the oral prednisolone group had a significantly lower stricture rate (4% [2/48 patients] vs 44% [11/25 patients]; PÂ < .0001) and a lower number of balloon dilation sessions (median, 0 [range, 0-4] vs 6 [range, 0-10]). Two cases of asymptomatic candida esophagitis occurred in the study group, but no severe adverse effects.
CONCLUSIONS: Oral prednisolone may offer a useful and safe preventive option for post-RFA stricture in ultralong ESCNs. (Clinical trial registration number: NCT05768282.).
