Title: Obese cardiogenic arrest survivors with significant coronary artery disease had worse in-hospital mortality and neurological outcomes.

Abstract: Cardiogenic arrest is the major cause of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), accounting for 20% of all deaths annually. The association between obesity and outcomes in cardiac arrest survivors is debatable. However, the effect of obesity on the prognosis of patients with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) successfully resuscitated from cardiogenic arrest is unclear. Thus, the association between body mass index (BMI) and outcomes in cardiogenic arrest survivors with significant CAD was investigated. This multicentre retrospective cohort study recruited 201 patients from January 2011 to September 2017. The eligible cardiogenic arrest survivors were non-traumatic adults who had undergone emergency coronary angiography after sustained return of spontaneous circulation and had significant coronary artery stenosis. BMI was used to classify the patients into underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese groups (&lt; 18.5, 18.5-24.9, 25.0-29.9, and ≥ 30 kg/m2; n = 9, 87, 72, and 33, respectively). In-hospital mortality and unsatisfactory neurological outcomes (cerebral performance scale scores = 3-5) were compared among the groups. The obese group presented higher in-hospital mortality and unsatisfactory neurological outcome risks than the normal-weight group (in-hospital mortality: adjusted hazard ratio = 4.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.87-12.04, P = 0.008; unsatisfactory neurological outcomes: adjusted odds ratio = 3.33, 95% CI 1.42-8.78, P = 0.009). Subgroup analysis showed significantly higher in-hospital mortality in the obese patients than in the others in each clinical characteristic. In cardiogenic arrest survivors with significant CAD, obesity was associated with high risks of mortality and unsatisfactory neurological recovery.
