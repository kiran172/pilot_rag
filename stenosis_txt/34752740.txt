Title: All-cause Readmission after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Community Hospital - Long Term Follow-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Post-procedure readmissions are associated with lower quality of life and increased economic burden. The study aimed to identify predictors for long-term all-cause readmissions in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in a community hospital.
METHODS: A Historical cohort study of all adults who underwent TAVR at Cape-Cod hospital between June 2015 and December 2017 was performed and data on readmissions was collected up-to May 2020 (median follow up of 3.3 years). Pre-procedure, procedure and in-hospital post-procedure parameters were collected. Readmission rate was evaluated, and univariate and multivariable analyses were applied to identify predictors for readmission.
RESULTS: The study included 262 patients (mean age 83.7±7.9 years, 59.9% males). The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) probability of mortality (PROM) score was 4.9 (IQR, 3.1-7.9). Overall, 120 patients were readmitted. Ten percent were readmitted within 1-month, 20.8% within 3-months, 32.0% within 6-months and 44.5% within 1-year. New readmissions after 1-year were rare. STS PROM 5% or above (HR 1.50, p = 0.039), pre-procedure anemia (HR 1.63, p = 0.034), severely decreased pre-procedure renal function (HR 1.93, p = 0.040) and procedural complication (HR 1.65, p = 0.013) were independent predictors for all-cause readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated procedural risk, anemia, renal dysfunction and procedural complication are important predictors for readmission. Pre-procedure and ongoing treatment of the patient's background diseases and completion of treatment for complications prior to discharge may contribute to a reduction in the rate of readmissions.
