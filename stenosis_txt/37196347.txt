Title: Natural Targeting Potent ROS-Eliminating Tungsten-Based Polyoxometalate Nanodots for Efficient Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension.

Abstract: Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a disease of pulmonary artery stenosis and blockage caused by abnormal pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs), with high morbidity and mortality. High levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in pulmonary arteries play a crucial role in inducing phenotypic switch and abnormal proliferation of PASMCs. However, antioxidants are rarely approved for the treatment of PH because of a lack of targeting and low bioavailability. In this study, the presence of an enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR)-like effect in the pulmonary arteries of PH is revealed by tissue transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Subsequently, for the first time, tungsten-based polyoxometalate nanodots (WNDs) are developed with potent elimination of multiple ROS for efficient treatment of PH thanks to the high proportion of reduced W5+ . WNDs are effectively enriched in the pulmonary artery by intravenous injection because of the EPR-like effect of PH, and significantly prevent the abnormal proliferation of PASMCs, greatly improve the remodeling of pulmonary arteries, and ultimately improve right heart function. In conclusion, this work provides a novel and effective solution to the dilemma of targeting ROS for the treatment of PH.
