Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients with and without Diabetes Mellitus.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients undergoing cardiac transcatheter or surgical interventions usually is correlated with poor outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been developed as a therapy choice for inoperable, high-, or intermediate-risk surgical patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of DM and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) on outcomes and survival after TAVI.
METHODS: Five hundred and fifty-two symptomatic severe AS patients who underwent TAVI, of whom 164 (29.7%) had DM, were included in this retrospective study. Follow-up was performed after 30 days, six months, and annually.
RESULTS: The device success and risks of procedural-related complications were similar between patients with and without DM, except for acute kidney injury, which was more frequent in the DM group (2.4% vs. 0%, P=0.021). In-hospital and first-year mortality were similar between the groups (4.9% vs. 3.6%, P=0.490 and 15.0% vs. 11.2%, P=0.282, respectively). There was a statistical difference between HbA1c ≥ 6.5 and HbA1c ≤ 6.49 groups in total mortality (34.4% vs. 15.8%, P<0.001, respectively). The only independent predictors were Society of Thoracic Surgeons score (hazard ratio [HR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.51; P=0.003) and HbA1c level ≥ 6.5 (HR 10.78, 95% CI 2.58-21.50; P=0.003) in multivariable logistic regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we conclude that DM was not correlated with an increased mortality risk or complication rates after TAVI. Also, it was shown that mortality was higher in patients with HbA1c ≥ 6.5, and it was an independent predictor for long-term mortality.
