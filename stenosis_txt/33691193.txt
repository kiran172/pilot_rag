Title: Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene Conduits With Bulging Sinuses and a Fan-Shaped Valve in Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction.

Abstract: We developed a handmade expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) pulmonary valvular conduit (PVC) with bulging sinuses and a fan-shaped ePTFE valve for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction. We aimed to investigate the results of this device in this multicenter study. From 2001 to 2020, 1776 patients underwent RVOT reconstruction using ePTFE PVCs at 65 institutions in Japan. The median age and body weight were 4.1 years (range, 3 days to 67.1 years) and 13.3 (range, 1.8-91.3) kg, respectively. The median PVC size was 18 (range, 8-24) mm. The median Z-value of the ePTFE PVC was 1.1 (range, -3.8 to 5.0). The ePTFE PVC conditions were investigated by cardiac echocardiography and catheterization. The median follow-up period was 3.3 years (range, 0 day to 16.2 years). There were only 9 cases (0.5%) with PVC-related unknown deaths. Reintervention was performed in 283 patients (15.9%), and 190 patients (10.7%) required explantation. Freedom from reintervention and explantation at 5/10 years were 86.7/61.5% and 93.0/69.1%, respectively. At the latest echocardiography, PVC regurgitation grade was better than mild in 88.4% patients. The average peak RVOT gradient was 15.7 Â± 15.9 mm Hg at the latest cardiac catheterization. ePTFE PVC infection was detected in only 8 patients (0.5%). Relative stenosis due to somatic growth was the most common cause of PVC explantation. The performance of ePTFE in terms of durability, valvular performance, and the resistance against infection is considerable and may replace conventional prosthetic materials. Further improvement of the ePTFE membrane is essential to prevent valvular dysfunction.
