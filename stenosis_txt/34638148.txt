Title: Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis: A Review.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is associated with hypertension and renal impairment. Atherosclerosis is the leading etiologic factor which accounts for >90% of the cases. Those with atherosclerotic RAS (ARAS) tend to have concomitant atherosclerosis in other vascular beds, so they are at a high risk of adverse coronary and cerebrovascular events. Management of ARAS is controversial, with limited indications for revascularization. In this review, the author aims to discuss the pathophysiology, natural history, diagnosis, and management of ARAS.
