Title: Predictors of Anastomotic Complications After Resection and Anastomosis for Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: Resection and anastomosis is an effective option for the management of complex tracheal stenosis, however, it's not without the complications. This study aims at evaluating various factors predicting anastomotic complications after trachea resection and anastomosis. This is a retrospective analysis of database from a dedicated thoracic surgical unit in New Delhi, India over 7 years. An analysis of demographic details, perioperative variables including complications were carried out. Analysis of various factors predicting anastomotic complications was performed. Out of 65 patients in the study, 49 (75.3%) were males and 16 (24.7%) were females. Median age of the patients was 31 years. Stenosis was cervical in 80%, cervico-thoracic in 15.4% and thoracic in 4.6% of patients. Median length of stenosis was 2.9 cm (1-4.2). 53 (81.6%) patients had some kind of preoperative intervention, where as rest 12 (18.4%) patients had no intervention at all. Out of 65 patients, 26 (40%) had crico-tracheal anastomosis while 39 (60%) had tracheo-tracheal anastomosis. Median length of resected tracheal segment was 3.3 cm (1-5). Overall complication rate (anastomotic + non-anastomotic) was 18.4% in which anastomosis related were in 4 (6.1%) patients. Resection of tracheal segment ≥ 3.5 cm, presence of diabetes mellitus and pre-operative use of corticosteroids were statistically significant factors for the onset of complications. Perioperative mortality rate was 1.5% (n = 1). Length of resection &gt; 3.5 cm, presence of diabetes mellitus and pre-operative prolonged use of corticosteroids were significant predictors for the anastomotic complications.
