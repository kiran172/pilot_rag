Title: [A Case of Cardiac Tamponade during Multimodal Treatment for Mediastinal Lymph Node Metastasis of Gastric Cancer].

Abstract: A 52-year-old man underwent total gastrectomy for gastric cancer and chemoradiotherapy for thoracic paraaortic lymph node metastasis. He also underwent esophageal stent implantation for stenosis. He was admitted to our hospital with fever and breathing difficulty and was diagnosed with infectious pericarditis. He showed symptoms of shock due to cardiac tamponade. After pericardial drainage, his vital signs improved. When signs of infection are detected in patients with a history of chemoradiotherapy or stent implantation, we should consider infectious pericarditis due to esophageal pericardial fistula and apply immediate drainage of cardiac tamponade.
