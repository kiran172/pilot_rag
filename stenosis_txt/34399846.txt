Title: Young adult with Gorham's disease presenting in an emergency department: a case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Gorham's disease is a very rare musculoskeletal disorder characterized by progressive resorption of one or more skeletal bones. Most of the 200 cases reported earlier are diagnosed before the age of 40 years. Due to rarity, the diagnosis of Gorham's disease in the Emergency Department may be very difficult.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of Gorham's disease. A 23-year old Caucasian man presented to the Emergency Department with a significant loss of power and sensation of the lower limbs and lower torso. Clinical examination, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed resorption of the ribs and vertebrae, severe kyphosis, and spinal stenosis in the thoracic area. The patient underwent several surgical procedures, including spondylodesis and decompression, and made a good initial recovery. Biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of Gorham's disease.
CONCLUSION: We present a young man with Gorham's disease visiting the Emergency Department. After the proper diagnosis and treatment, our patient had good outcome, although the etiology of this rare disease is uncertain.
