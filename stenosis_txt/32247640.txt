Title: Non-coding RNAs: Regulators of valvular calcification.

Abstract: There is currently a growing global burden of valvular heart diseases due to aging populations and changing lifestyles. Valvular heart diseases mainly include the malfunctioning of aortic and mitral valves and are characterized by extensive tissue remodeling, which includes calcification, endothelial dysfunction, and endothelial-mesenchymal transition. These valvular remodeling processes are known to be regulated by protein-coding genes as well as non-coding genes. Here, we have summarized studies highlighting the non-coding RNA mediated regulation of valvular tissue remodeling and their potential therapeutic benefits. Additionally, studies investigating the diagnostic capability of circulating non-coding RNA molecules in valvular diseases are also summarized. Overall, of the various candidates, several studies have highlighted miR-214 and miR-204 as central regulators of valvular calcification.
