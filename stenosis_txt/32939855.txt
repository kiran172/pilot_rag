Title: Transcatheter valve-in-valve implantation Edwards Sapien XT in a direct flow valve after early degeneration.

Abstract: In recent years, the use of bioprosthetic valve (BPV) has increased significantly with both surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) due to reasons such as the advantage of not using anticoagulants. Nevertheless, major disadvantage of all BPV is the risk of early structural valve deterioration, leading to valve dysfunction, and requires reoperation, which significantly increases the risk of mortality or major morbidity especially after SAVR. There are a limited number of TAV-in-TAV case reports due to TAVI BPV degeneration. In our knowledge, this is the second report of TAV-in-TAV implantation wherein a previously implanted transfemoral 25-mm nonmetallic Direct Flow SVD valve treated with ViV TAVI via Edwards Sapien XT.
