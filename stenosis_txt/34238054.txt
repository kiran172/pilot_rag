Title: Effect of the ratio of vessel-specific volume to fractional myocardial mass on fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: This study aimed to examine whether the ratio of vessel-specific coronary arterial lumen volume to the fraction of myocardial mass (V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub>) affects myocardial ischemia. We proposed a calculation method for V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub>, and compared the ratio of total epicardial coronary arterial lumen volume to left ventricular myocardial mass (V/M) with V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> in predicting myocardial ischemia. V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> and V/M were computed using data from 205 patients with 241 stenosis vessel who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA), quantitative coronary angiography, and fractional flow reserve. The vessel-specific coronary arterial lumen volume (V<sub>R</sub>) was obtained from CTA by segmenting the coronary arterial lumen volume, while the vessel-specific fraction of myocardial mass (M<sub>R</sub>) was obtained by allometric scaling. The V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> was then calculated. The cut-off values of V/M (23.55 mm3/g) and V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> (12.98 mm3/g) were used to define equal groups of ischemic and non-ischemic patients, respectively. Using these cut-off values, the accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of V/M were 60%, 76%, 45%, 57%, and 66%, and of V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> were 87%, 92%, 77%, 89%, and 83%, respectively. Patients have different V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> values in different stenotic coronary arteries. Clinically, V<sub>R</sub>/M<sub>R</sub> is a quantitative indicator of the risk of myocardial ischemia.
