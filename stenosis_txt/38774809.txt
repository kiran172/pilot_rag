Title: Pulmonary Vein Stenosis After Single Lung Transplantation.

Abstract: A 72-year-old man with interstitial lung disease underwent a planned single lung transplantation. His late postoperative course was notable for hemodynamic deterioration, after which severe right pulmonary vein anastomotic stenosis was identified via echocardiogram. The case highlights a rare complication of lung transplantation diagnosed by using transesophageal echocardiogram.
