Title: Comparison of the Predicting Value of Neutrophil to high-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio and Monocyte to high-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Ratio for in-Hospital Prognosis and Severe Coronary Artery Stenosis in Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction Following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention: A Retrospective Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neutrophil to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (NHR) has demonstrated predictive value for coronary artery disease (CAD). However, few research has been conducted on the predictive capacity of NHR for Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) following Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI) or the degree of coronary artery stenosis in hospitalized ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients.
METHODS: The study involved 486 patients diagnosed with STEMI between the years 2020 and 2023. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the risk factors for MACE after PCI and severe coronary artery stenosis during hospitalization. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine predictive power of NHR and MHR. Spearman correlation analysis was performed to assess the correlation between NHR, MHR and the Gensini score (GS).
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the NHR and MHR were the independent risk factor for MACE during hospitalization in STEMI patients (MHR: the odds ratio (OR)=2.347, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.082-5.089, P=0.031) (NHR: OR=1.092, 95% CI=1.025-1.165, P=0.004). In addition, NHR was also an independent risk factor for high GS (NHR: OR=1.103, 95% CI=1.047-1.162, P&lt;0.001), and the MHR was not an independent risk factor. The ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the predictive ability of NHR and MHR for in-hospital MACE in STEMI patients after primary PCI. The area under the curve (AUC) for NHR was 0.681. The AUC for MHR was 0.672. Regarding the prediction of high GS, the AUC for NHR was 0.649. The AUC for MHR was 0.587. Spearman correlation analysis showed that NHR exhibited stronger correlation with GS, while MHR was lower (NHR: r=0.291, P&lt;0.001) (MHR: r=0.156, P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSION: These findings highlight the potential clinical utility of NHR as a predictive indicator in STEMI patients after PCI during hospitalization, both for MACE events and the degree of coronary artery stenosis.
