Title: Carotid Endarterectomy for Ocular Ischemic Syndrome: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Ocular ischemic syndrome is a rare complication of carotid arterial disease that can lead to irreversible vision loss. The disease is related to ocular hypoperfusion secondary to carotid stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has been proven to reduce the risk of embolic stroke in specific patient populations; however, the role of CEA in the treatment of ocular ischemic syndrome or other flow-related symptoms is less well defined. We present a case of ocular ischemic syndrome successfully treated with carotid endarterectomy, and summarize the current literature regarding management of ocular ischemic syndrome.
