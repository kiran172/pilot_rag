Title: Lumbar radiculopathy due to foraminal stenosis with ossification of the ligamentum flavum: a case report.

Abstract: The patient was an 82-year-old woman with a diagnosis of lumbar radiculopathy due to foraminal stenosis accompanied by ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF). Computed tomography scans of the lumbar spine revealed ossification in the capsular portion of the ligamentum flavum around the L2-L3 facet joint. In addition, computed tomography images acquired a few months before the onset of radiculopathy had shown that the ossification site had gradually expanded to include the superior articular process. The patient's symptoms disappeared immediately after excision of the OLF. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen indicated replacement of degenerated ligamentum flavum with ossified tissue via a gradual endochondral ossification process. It is important to be aware that foraminal stenosis can in rare cases occur due to OLF, even in the lumbar spine.
