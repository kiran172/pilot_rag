Title: Pipeline Flex with Shield Technology Placement for Small- and Medium-sized Aneurysms Achieves Early Complete Occlusion.

Abstract: The flow diverter has been shown to be a safe and effective device for large cerebral aneurysms in the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA). Recently, its indication has been expanded to small- and medium-sized cerebral aneurysms in the distal segment of the ICA. In this study, we report a single-center, retrospective investigation of the safety and efficacy of the Pipeline Flex device to treat these aneurysms. Of the patients who underwent Pipeline implantation for small- and medium-sized ICA aneurysms (≤12 mm) at our hospital between July 2013 and October 2021, 102 patients with 104 aneurysms were included in this study. The mean age of the patients was 57.7 ± 12.1 years, and 94 (90.4%) were female. The mean aneurysmal dome diameter was 9.2 ± 2.3 mm, the mean neck diameter was 5.3 ± 1.6 mm, and the mean dome-to-neck ratio was 1.8 ± 0.5. Twenty-five patients (24.0%) had incorporated vessels from the aneurysm. Complete occlusion of the aneurysms was obtained in 96 patients (92.3%). There were no cases of parent artery stenosis or major stroke after the procedure. Absence of incorporated vessel from the aneurysm dome and adjunctive coil embolization are statistically significant factors indicating complete occlusion in multivariate analysis. The time to complete occlusion was determined earlier with the use of the Pipeline Shield (p = 0.0386) and with adjunctive coils (p = 0.0025). We showed that Pipeline implantation for small- and medium-sized aneurysms was safe and highly effective.
