Title: Right Ventricular and Outflow Tract Functional Characteristics After Repair of Tetralogy of Fallot with Major Aortopulmonary Collaterals.

Abstract: This study describes right ventricle (RV) characteristics and right ventricle to pulmonary artery (RV-PA) conduit function pre- and post-repair in patients with tetraology of Fallot with major aortopulmonary collaterals (TOF/MAPCAs). We reviewed patients who underwent single-stage, complete unifocalization, and repair of TOF/MAPCAs between 2006 and 2019 with available pre- and early postoperative echocardiograms. For a subset of patients, 6-12 month follow-up echocardiogram was available. RV and left ventricle (LV) characteristics and RV-PA conduit function were reviewed. Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar's test were used. 170 patients were reviewed, 46 had follow-up echocardiograms. Tricuspid valve annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) Z-scores were reduced from pre- (Z-score 0.01) to post-repair (Z-score -4.5, p < 0.001), improved but remained abnormal at follow-up (Z-score -4.0, p < 0.001). RV fractional area change (FAC) and LV ejection fraction were not significantly different before and after surgery. Conduit regurgitation was moderate or greater in 11% at discharge, increased to 65% at follow-up. RV-PA conduit failure (severe pulmonary stenosis or severe pulmonary regurgitation) was noted in 61, and 63% had dilated RV (diastolic RV area Z-score > 2) at follow-up. RV dilation correlated with the severe conduit regurgitation (p = 0.018). Longitudinal RV function was reduced after complete repair of TOF/MAPCAs, with decreased TAPSE and preserved FAC and LV ejection fraction. TAPSE improved but did not normalize at follow-up. Severe RV-PA conduit dysfunction was observed prior to discharge in 11% of patients and in 61% at follow-up. RV dilation was common at follow-up, especially in the presence of severe conduit regurgitation.
