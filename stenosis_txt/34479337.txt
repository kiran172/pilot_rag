Title: [Redefining the gold standard for aortic valve replacement: Minimally invasive with accelerated recovery].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite being introduced 20 years ago minimally invasive aortic valve replacement is only performed routinely in a minority of patients world-wide.
AIM: To report the operative outcome of minimally invasive aortic valve replacement done through a partial upper sternotomy.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of data recorded prospectively of 450 consecutive patients with a median age of 66 years (59% males) who had a minimally invasive aortic replacement.
RESULTS: 79% of patients had aortic stenosis. Cross clamp/cardiopulmonary bypass times (median) were 56 and 68 minutes respectively. Conversion to full sternotomy was required in 2.6% of patients, reoperation for bleeding in 2.9%. 1.6% suffered a stroke and 19% postoperative atrial fibrillation. 0.9% required a permanent pacemaker. Postoperative mortality was 0.9%. Median postoperative hospital stay was six days.
CONCLUSIONS: Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement can be performed with satisfactory results.
