Title: Hand-sewn expanded polytetrafluoroethylene valved conduit for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Due to the lack of large-sized pulmonary valved conduit products in clinical practice, hand-sewn expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) valved conduit has been used for right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) reconstruction in many heart centers around the world. This study aims to summarize the early results of the ePTFE valved conduit and the sewing technology of the conduit in combination with the latest progress, and to provide a reference for the application of ePTFE valved conduit.
METHODS: A total of 21 patients using ePTFE valved conduit for RVOT reconstruction in the Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University from October 2018 to October 2020 were prospectively enrolled in this study. The age at the implantation of the conduit was 4.3 to 43.8 (median 15.1) years old, with weight of (38.9±4.1) kg. In this cohort, 14 patients underwent re-reconstruction of RVOT, including 12 patients with pulmonary regurgitation at 6.3 to 31.0 (median 13.8) years after tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) repair, and 2 patients with failed bovine jugular vein conduit (BJVC). Seven patients underwent Ross operations. Among them, 3 were for aortic valve stenosis, 2 were for aortic regurgitation, and 2 were for both stenosis and regurgitation. The ePTFE valved conduits were standard hand-sewn during the surgery. The 3 leaflets were equal in size with arc-shaped lower edge of the valve sinus. The free edge of the valve leaflets was straight with the length of about 1 mm longer than the diameter. The height of the valve sinus was 4/5 of the diameter. The junction of the valve leaflet was 3/4 of the height of the sinus. The designed leaflets were then continuous non-penetrating sutured into the inner surface of Gore-Tex vessel to make a valved conduit. Valved conduits with diameter of 18, 20, and 22 mm were used in 2, 9, and 10 cases, respectively. The surgical results, postoperative recovery time, and serious complications were summarized, and the changes of postoperative cardiac function status and hemodynamic status of the conduits were investigated.
RESULTS: During the implantation of ePTFE valved conduit for RVOT reconstruction, 2 patients underwent mechanical mitral valve replacement with Ross operation, 2 patients with pulmonary regurgitation with repaired TOF underwent left and right pulmonary artery angioplasty, and 1 patient with failed BJVC underwent tricuspid valvuloplasty. The cardiopulmonary bypassing time for patients underwent re-reconstruction of RVOT was (130.9±16.9) min, with aorta clamping for 1 patient to repair the residual defect of the ventricular septum. The cardiopulmonary bypassing and aorta clamping time for Ross operation were (242.7±20.6) min and (145.6±10.5) min, respectively. The duration of postoperative ventilator assistance, intensive care unit stay, and hospital stay were 3.5 h to 7.7 d (median 17.1 h),11.2 h to 29.5 d (median 1.9 d), and 6.0 to 56.0 (median 13.0) d, respectively. All patients survived after discharge from hospital. The follow-up rate after discharge was 100% with median time at 15.0 (13.0 to 39.0) months. No death happened during the follow-up. One patient underwent stent implantation due to right coronary stenosis 2 months after Ross operation. One patient underwent balloon dilation due to right pulmonary artery ostium stenosis 1 year after re-reconstruction of RVOT. The cardiac function of all patients recovered to NYHA class I 6 months after operation. The peak pressure gradient across the valve measured by transthoracic echocardiography before discharge was (9.4±2.6) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa), and (18.3±6.1) mmHg at the last follow-up. There was no significant increase in the gradient during the follow-up (P=0.134). No patient suffered from mild or more pulmonary regurgitation.
CONCLUSIONS: Hand-sewn ePTFE valved conduit is feasible for RVOT reconstruction. It is a promising material for RVOT reconstruction which can effectively meet clinical need. In our experience, the ePTFE valved conduit is simple to manufacture with satisfactory early outcomes.In the application of ePTFE valved conduit, attention should be paid to implantation indications and postoperative anticoagulation management, especially to the preparation details of the valved conduit, to obtain better function and durability of the conduit after implantation.
