Title: Management and Discussion of COVID-19 Related Tracheal Stenosis: A Single Center Retrospective Review.

Abstract: SARS-CoV-2 virus has led to an unprecedented amount of tracheal stenosis. Rigid bronchoscopy can serve as a curative measure or bridge therapy to tracheal resection. We also briefly discuss the pathophysiology of tracheal stenosis from prolonged intubation and SARS-CoV-2 virus. This should be differentiated from other forms of airway obstruction such as tracheobronchomalacia which would be considered a pseudo-tracheal stenotic disease. The aim of this study is to evaluate stenosis that is unable to be improved with positive airway pressure or "PAP" therapies and required stenting and/or subsequent tracheal resection. By performing Rigid Bronchoscopy and subsequent stenting of airways, we demonstrated outcomes for long term airway patency regarding patients who were intubated secondary to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We demonstrate superb outcomes in a consecutive case series of 6 patients managed with rigid bronchoscopy, airway stent and tracheal resection. The patients were all managed from a pulmonary perspective by the physicians mentioned in this study.
