Title: Heart valve disease: a journey of discovery.

Abstract: In the centenary year of the British Cardiovascular Society (BCS), this review article outlines the influence of UK cardiologists and surgeons on the field of heart valve disease, many of whom can rightly claim 'world firsts' in the field. From the description of endocarditis as we know it today at the turn of the 20th century, to the first mitral valvotomy, heart valve replacement and invention of the Ross procedure. These advances have transformed the outlook of patients with symptomatic valve disease from palliation and certain death to curative treatment and near normal life expectancy. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) was adopted early in the UK, and thanks to the comprehensive national database, the UK TAVI registry is one of the world's largest, contributing real-world patient data to inform clinical practice. The more recent concepts of 'Heart Valve Centres of Excellence' and specialist valve clinics have been developed by the BCS-affiliated British Heart Valve Society which continues to drive improved standards for patients with heart valve disease. The next 100 years will no doubt be equally thrilling in terms of innovation for heart valve disease, with artificial intelligence, transcatheter therapies and cutting-edge technology continuing to improve patient care and clinical outcomes.
