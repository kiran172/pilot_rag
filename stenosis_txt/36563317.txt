Title: Patency Capsule: A Novel Independent Predictor for Long-Term Outcomes Among Patients With Quiescent Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Patency capsule (PC) is a recommended procedure to rule out small bowel stenosis before video capsule endoscopy (VCE). We examined future clinical outcomes among patients with a failed PC vs patients in whom the PC had passed (passed PC).
METHODS: A post hoc analysis of 2 prospective cohort studies of adult patients with quiescent small bowel Crohn's disease (CD) who underwent PC between 2013 and 2020. The primary composite outcome was the need for intestinal surgery or endoscopic dilation during follow-up in patients with or without a failed PC.
RESULTS: A total of 190 patients were included (47: failed PC and 143: passed PC, median follow-up 34.12 months). Patients with a failed PC had higher rates of the primary composite outcome (21.3% vs 1.4%, hazard ratio [HR] 20.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-93.7, P < 0.001) and also secondary outcomes including intestinal surgery (14.9% vs 0.70%, P < 0.001), endoscopic dilation (14.9% vs 0.70%, P < 0.001), admissions (23.3% vs 5.7%, P < 0.001), and clinical flares (43.9% vs 27.7%, P = 0.005) during follow-up compared with controls. Failed PC was the only statistically significant factor for surgery and/or endoscopic dilation, regardless of a B2/B3 phenotype at baseline. In sensitivity analyses restricted only to patients with a stricturing phenotype (n = 73), a failed PC still predicted the long-term composite outcome (HR 8.68, 95% CI 1.72-43.68, P = 0.002). Of the 190 patients ingesting a PC, only 1 patient with a failed PC had 48 hours of self-limiting mild symptoms.
DISCUSSION: Patients with clinically stable CD with a failed PC have worse long-term clinical outcomes than those without, independently of the CD phenotype. Standalone PC may serve as a novel, safe, and affordable prognostic examination to identify patients with quiescent CD who have a higher risk for future worse clinical outcomes.
