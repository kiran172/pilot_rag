Title: NEUTROPHIL-LYMPHOCYTE RATIO AND PLATELET-LYMPHOCYTE RATIO AS PREDICTORS OF CORONARY MICROCIRCULATORY DISEASE OCCURRENCE AND OUTCOME IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC CORONARY SYNDROME AND NO SIGNIFICANT CORONARY ARTERY STENOSIS.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Introduction: Index of microcirculatory resistance assessment is an invasive method of measuring coronary microcirculation function. Association between impaired microcirculatory function and higher rate of cardiovascular events was proven. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio seem to be a promising parameters to predict coronary microcirculatory disease in patients with chronic coronary syndrome. The aim: To determine neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio levels in patients with coronary microcirculatory disease and potential association with clinical outcome.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Material and methods: 82 consecutive patients with mean age of 67 years, 67% male, were tested for presence of coronary microcirculatory disease using index of microcirculatory resistance. Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio were calculated based on admission full blood count. Follow-up with major adverse cardiac and cardiovascular events registration was performed (median 24 months).
RESULTS: Results: The study showed significantly higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio in patients with coronary microcirculatory disease compared to control group (3.58±2.61 vs 2.54±1.09 and 164±87.9 vs 124±36.6 respectively). Higher level of platelet-lymphocyte ratio in patients with coronary microcirculatory disease results in worse MACCE-free survival. Optimal cut-off values of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio to detect coronary microcirculatory disease were 3.2 and 181.3, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Higher neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio and platelet-lymphocyte ratio are associated with increased index of microcirculatory resistance value. Platelet-lymphocyte ratio may be used as a predictor of worse outcome in patients with coronary microcirculatory disease.
