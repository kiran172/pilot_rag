Title: Concomitant Cervical Spine Stenosis Negatively Affects Subpectoral Biceps Tenodesis Outcomes.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine whether an association exists between the presence of cervical spine pathology and postoperative patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients undergoing open subpectoral biceps tenodesis (BT).
METHODS: A retrospective review of patients undergoing isolated BT from August 2011 to May 2019 was conducted. Cases were defined as patients with concomitant cervical spine disease (disc disease, disc herniations, neuroforaminal/central stenosis). Controls were patients without cervical spine disease. Postoperative PROs were collected from all patients with a minimum of 12-month follow-up. Cases and controls were matched 1:1 using age and body mass index. PROs were compared using the χ2 text, Fisher exact test, or analysis of variance.
RESULTS: A total of 23 cases and 23 controls were identified. Cases and controls had similar distributions of age (42.4 ± 4.4 years, 40.4 ± 4.5, P = .15), sex (83% male, 87% male, P = .68), body mass index (28.0 ± 4.0, 27.6 ± 4.3, P = .78), and percentage of athletes (65% athlete, 61% athlete. P = .76). All cases had evidence of neuroforaminal stenosis and multilevel degenerative disc disease, whereas 19 of 23 (83%) had evidence of central canal stenosis. Cases had a greater visual analog scale (VAS) score during Sport score (3.6 ± 0.7 vs 1.2 ± 0.6, P = .013) and lower Subjective Shoulder Value (69.5 ± 5.8 vs 84.1 ± 5.4, P = .070) and Shoulder Instability-Return to Sport after Injury score (60.4 ± 5.8 vs 77.4 ± 6.0, P = .046). There were no significant differences between groups' ASES, baseline VAS, overall satisfaction scores, and willingness to undergo the same operation again. No significant differences were found in postoperative rate of return to sport, time to return, and return to preoperative competitiveness.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SLAP tears undergoing isolated BT in the presence of cervical spinal stenosis may have inferior Subjective Shoulder Value, Shoulder Instability-Return to Sport after Injury, and VAS during sport scores as compared with controls, although many PROs were similar at follow-up. Athletes undergoing BT, particularly with concomitant cervical spine pathology, should be counseled appropriately before surgery.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, case-control study.
