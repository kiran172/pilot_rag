Title: Microscopic Unilateral Approach for Bilateral Decompression of Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This is a study based on single-surgeon data on spinal stenosis surgery via microscopic approach. The aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the unilateral approach to bilateral decompression and the usage of Taylor retractors and brain spatula in patients with spinal stenosis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study on bilateral decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis using a microscopic unilateral approach by a single surgeon, between April 2015 and March 2018. In total, 50 patients were operated due to single level lumbar spinal stenosis. All patients were evaluated by preoperative and postoperative plain radiographs and magnetic resonance (MR) images. Walking distance (WD), visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and Odom's criteria were evaluated for follow-up.
RESULTS: One level of the lumbar spine was surgically decompressed in all patients. The median age of patients was 64.6 (51- 82). Of the patients, 72% (36) were women, and 28% (14) were men. Most patients had refractory low back pain (96%) after conservative treatment. The stenotic levels of the cases were as follows: L3-4, 23(46%); L4-5, 24(48%); and L5-S1, 3 (6%). VAS scores decreased in all patients after surgery. According to Odom's criteria, an excellent or good score was found in 43 patients at the 12th follow-up examination. WDs increased up to 1000 meters for 41 patients.
CONCLUSION: The microscopic unilateral approach to bilateral decompression is an effective method for decompression in spinal stenosis. Via this approach, surgical trauma is reduced and surgically induced instability is avoided as much as possible.
