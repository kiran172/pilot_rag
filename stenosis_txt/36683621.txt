Title: Oral higher dose prednisolone to prevent stenosis after endoscopic submucosal dissection for early esophageal cancer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophageal stenosis is one of the main complications of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the treatment of large-area superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and precancerous lesions (≥ 3/4 of the lumen). Oral prednisone is useful to prevent esophageal stenosis, but the curative effect remains controversial.
AIM: To share our experience of the precautions against esophageal stenosis after ESD to remove large superficial esophageal lesions.
METHODS: Between June 2019 and March 2022, we enrolled patients with large superficial esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia experienced who underwent ESD. Prednisone (50 mg/d) was administered orally on the second morning after ESD for 1 mo, and tapered gradually (5 mg/wk) for 13 wk.
RESULTS: In total, 14 patients met the inclusion criteria. All patients received ESD without operation-related bleeding or perforation. There were 11 patients with ≥ 3/4 and &lt; 7/8 of lumen mucosal defects and 1 patient with ≥ 7/8 of lumen mucosal defect and 2 patients with the entire circumferential mucosal defects due to ESD. The longitudinal extension of the esophageal mucosal defect was &lt; 50 mm in 3 patients and ≥ 50 mm in 11 patients. The esophageal stenosis rate after ESD was 0% (0/14). One patient developed esophageal candida infection on the 30th d after ESD, and completely recovered after 7 d of administration of oral fluconazole 100 mg/d. No other adverse events of oral steroids were found.
CONCLUSION: Oral prednisone (50 mg/d) and prolonged prednisone usage time may effectively prevent esophageal stricture after ESD without increasing the incidence of glucocorticoid-related adverse events. However, further investigation of larger samples is required to warrant feasibility and safety.
