Title: The importance of ankel-brachial index in prediction vascular complications in transradial access procedures.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to explore the predictors of vascular complications (VCs) associated with transradial access, as the occurrence and severity of these complications were found to be significantly lower compared to femoral access. However, it is important to note that the occurrence of these complications still has a negative impact on clinical outcomes. Nevertheless, there is limited available data on the predictors of complications specifically related to radial access.
METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was conducted on individuals who underwent percutaneous coronary diagnostic or therapeutic procedures at Daping Hospital, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The study compared demographic characteristics, VC types, ankle brachial index (ABI), and severity of coronary artery stenosis between the two groups.
RESULTS: We enrolled 300 subjects with VCs and 300 age- and sex-matched subjects without VCs as controls. There were no differences in the baseline characteristics or comorbidities between the groups. Compared to the control group, the VC group has a higher portion of left radial access (6.0%) and previous radial artery puncture history (29.7% vs. 18.3%, p&lt;0.001). The ABI was significantly lower than the non-VC group (1.17  ±  0.17 vs. 1.23 ± 0.14, p&lt;0.001). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, several factors were found to be independently associated with the occurrence of VC. These factors include ABI (OR=0.060, 95% CI: 0.014-0.249, p&lt;0.001), the procedure being performed by junior operators (OR=1.892, 95% CI: 1.314-2.745, p&lt;0.001), and previous access on the same radial artery (OR=1.795, 95% CI: 1.190-2.707, p&lt;0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients who exhibit a lower ABI and have a history of prior radial access procedures may be at an increased risk of developing radial access VC. Therefore, it is recommended to routinely measure ABI prior to these procedures, as it may serve as a predictive tool for assessing the risk of VC.
