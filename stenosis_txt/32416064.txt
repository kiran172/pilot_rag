Title: Ventricular Septal Defect Pulmonary Atresia: Provisional Bifurcation Strategy for Confluence Stenosis During Patent Ductus Arteriosis Stenting.

Abstract: Neonates with pulmonary atresia survive only if duct patency is maintained before staged surgical repair. Ductal stenting is an effective alternative to conventional shunt surgery, as it avoids thoracotomy. With today's generation of coronary stents having better profile, flexibility, and trackability, it may be achieved safely, with less difficulty than previously described. The strategy during patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting with trifurcation narrowing is a real challenge. We present an underweight newborn with ventricular septal defect pulmonary atresia, restrictive PDA, and bilateral branch stenosis at the ostia. We performed a successful PDA stenting as well as addressed the ostia of branch pulmonary arteries.
