Title: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty using veno-arterial loop and neuro-embolic protection for mitral stenosis with thrombus.

Abstract: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is not traditionally suitable for patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and left atrium (LA) thrombus. Moreover, PBMV cannot be performed in patients with LA thrombus not resolving after anti-coagulation treatment. Here we present a case of PBMV using a novel technique employing both a veno-arterial loop and neuro-embolic protection, in a patient with MS and LA thrombus resistant to warfarin therapy. The patient successfully underwent PBMV without any complications.
