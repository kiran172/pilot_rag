Title: Mass-Forming Portal Biliopathy Presenting as Extreme Wall-Thickening of the Common Bile Duct.

Abstract: Portal biliopathy refers to biliary tree abnormalities in patients with peribiliary collateral vessels and non-neoplastic extrahepatic portal vein occlusion. These biliary abnormalities are caused by vascular compression and ischemic damage of the biliary tree, which can result in bile duct compression, stenosis, fibrotic strictures, bile duct dilation, and thickening of the bile duct wall. Portal biliopathy is difficult to distinguish from cholangiocarcinoma, IgG4-related disease, and sclerosing cholangitis. Although most patients are asymptomatic, portal biliopathy can lead to serious complications, such as recurrent cholangitis. This case illustrates the importance of including portal biliopathy in the differential diagnosis at an early stage, especially in patients with portal hypertension. With early recognition, the need for additional invasive diagnostic procedures such as biopsies is minimized. Pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnostics, and treatment options of portal biliopathy are described in the article.
