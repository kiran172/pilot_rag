Title: Risk Stratification and Management of Extracranial Carotid Artery Disease.

Abstract: Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and is a leading cause of disability. Extracranial internal carotid artery stenosis is a major cause of ischemic stroke, as it is estimated to cause 8% to 15% of ischemic strokes. It is critical to improve our strategies for stroke prevention and treatment in order to reduce the burden of this disease. Herein, we review approaches for the diagnosis and risk stratification of carotid artery disease as well as interventional strategies for the prevention and treatment of strokes caused by carotid artery disease.
