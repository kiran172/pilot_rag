Title: Association of the Novel Inflammatory Marker Systemic Immune-Inflammation index and Contrast-Induced Nephropathy in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: This study investigated whether the systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) is an independent predictor of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for severe aortic stenosis. TAVR patients (n = 130) were included in the study. The patients were divided into 2 groups: those who developed CIN [CIN (+)] and those who did not [CIN (-)]. The SII was calculated as the ratio of the product of the total neutrophil count and the total platelet count to the lymphocyte count. CIN developed in 20 (15.3%) patients after TAVR. White blood cell count (7.66 ± 1.75 vs 6.78 ± 1.71 103/mm3P = .038), neutrophil count (5.1 (3.9-6.7) vs 4.2 (3.5-5.1) 103/mm3P = .024), neutrophillymphocyte ratio (4.20 (2.39-7.00) vs 2.75 (2.06-3.88), P = .010) and SII index (1069 (616-1514) vs 598 (426-955), P = .003) were at higher levels in patients with CIN. In addition, the SII index was an independent predictor for the development of CIN. The SII index, which can be easily calculated from a complete blood count, is an independent predictor of CIN in patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis.
