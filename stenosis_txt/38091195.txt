Title: Assessment of the Severity of Aortic Regurgitation by Noninvasive Imaging : Non-invasive MMI for AR.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The role of multimodality imaging in the evaluation of patients with aortic regurgitation is summarized in this review.
RECENT FINDINGS: The etiology (mechanism) of the aortic regurgitation and the severity of aortic regurgitation and hemodynamic consequences are key in the decision making of patients with severe aortic regurgitation. While echocardiography remains as the leading technique to assess all these parameters, other imaging techniques have become essential for the accurate assessment of aortic regurgitation severity and the timing of aortic intervention. The anatomic suitability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation in inoperable patients with severe aortic regurgitation is usually assessed with computed tomography. Aortic regurgitation is a prevalent disease with various pathophysiological mechanisms that need a personalized treatment. The evaluation of the mechanism and severity of aortic regurgitation can be initially performed with echocardiography. Three-dimensional techniques, including echocardiography, have become very relevant for accurate assessment of the regurgitation severity and its hemodynamic consequences. Assessment of myocardial tissue characteristics with cardiac magnetic resonance is key in the risk stratification of patients and in the timing of aortic intervention. Computed tomography is important in the assessment of aortic dimensions and selection of patients for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
