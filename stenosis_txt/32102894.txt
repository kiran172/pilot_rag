Title: Persistent sore throat: a case of laryngeal mucous membrane pemphigoid.

Abstract: We present a case of a 72-year-old women who presented with a persistent sore throat and productive cough. On flexible nasendoscopy examination, she was found to have a fairly superficial ulcer affecting the laryngeal surface and tip of her epiglottis. On her second microlaryngoscopy and biopsy, direct immunofluorescent staining of the biopsy was analysed and the histological findings were in keeping with a diagnosis of mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP). MMP is a rare chronic autoimmune condition characterised by the presence of blistering subepithelial lesions that can cause scarring. Laryngeal MMP affects only 1 in 10â€‰million people and can lead to life-threatening airway compromise arising from scarring and stenosis. As there is a large spectrum of disease, it is important to adopt a multidisciplinary approach including dermatologists, otolaryngologists and ophthalmologists for prompt diagnosis and early recognition of potential complications, maximising functional outcomes for patients.
