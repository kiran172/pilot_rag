Title: Functional Recovery of a Failed Radial Artery Graft After Progression of Native Coronary Stenosis.

Abstract: Competitive flow from the native vessel can lead to coronary graft failure. However, restoration of graft patency can occasionally occur. We present the case of subtotal occlusion of a radial artery graft bypassing a lesion with moderate stenosis, with subsequent late functional recovery once the native vessel disease had progressed. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
