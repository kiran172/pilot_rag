Title: MicroRNA-547-5p-mediated interleukin-33/suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 signaling underlies the genesis and maintenance of neuropathic pain and is targeted by the therapy with bone marrow stromal cells.

Abstract: Interleukin-33 (IL-33)/suppressor of tumorigenicity 2 (ST2) signaling is known to promote inflammation and the genesis and maintenance of neuropathic pain. However, it remained mostly unknown how IL-33/ST2 signaling can be enhanced by neuropathic stimulations. Here, we report that the chronic constriction nerve injury (CCI)-induced increases in the expression of IL-33 and ST2 and a decrease in microRNA (miRNA)-547-5p not only in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) but also in spinal dorsal horn (SDH) ipsilateral to the CCI. We found that increasing endogenous miRNA-547-5p by the intrathecal (i.t.) infusion of agomir-miR-547-5p did not produce any effect in naive rats but blocked the CCI-induced increases in the IL-33 and ST2, and pain sensitivity. The reducing endogenous miRNA-547-5p by the i.t. delivering antagomir-miR-547-5p into naive rats caused significant changes in IL-33 and ST2 expressions in both the DRG and SDH, and pain sensitivity, which were similar to those induced by the CCI. Since increasing IL-33 by the i.t. infusion of recombinant IL-33 produced no change in the expression of miR-547-5p, and the CCI still reduced miR-547-5p expression in rats with the IL-33 knockdown, we conclude that the reduction of miR-547-5p can be an upstream event leading to the enhancement of IL-33/ST2 signaling induced by the CCI. The intravenous application of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) reduced the depression of miR-547-5p in both the DRG and SDH, and pain hypersensitivity produced by the CCI or antagomir-miR547-5p application. However, the BMSC effect was significantly occluded by the pretreatment with miR-547-5p agomir or the IL-33 knockdown, demonstrating a novel mechanism underlying the BMSC therapy.
