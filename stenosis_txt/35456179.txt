Title: Carotid Artery Stenting in Patients with Symptomatic and Asymptomatic Stenosis: In-Hospital Clinical Outcomes at a Single Neurovascular Center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a minimally invasive and proven percutaneous procedure that is widely used to treat patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The purpose of this study was to characterize the in-hospital outcomes of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients undergoing CAS at a single neurovascular center.
METHODS: The study was conducted as a retrospective analysis of 1158 patients (asymptomatic, n = 636; symptomatic, n = 522; male, n = 816; median age, 71 years; NASCET method, 70-99% stenosis, n = 830) who underwent CAS between May 2009 and December 2020. In-hospital neurological outcomes, adverse reactions to iodinated contrast media, acute myocardial infarction, intraprocedural complications, and access-site issues were evaluated. The primary endpoints were disabling stroke (including disabling cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome [CHS]) and all in-hospital deaths.
RESULTS: A carotid stent could not be deployed in one patient due to calcified plaques (technical failure rate of 0.09%). Four patients (0.3%) experienced in-hospital, stroke-associated death, while five patients (0.4%) died from non-stroke-related causes. All stroke-associated deaths occurred in the symptomatic group and were due to CHS. The disabling stroke rate was 0.9% overall (n = 10; 0.5% versus 1.3% in asymptomatic versus symptomatic patients, respectively). Nineteen patients (1.6%) reached the in-hospital primary endpoint. More patients in the symptomatic group achieved this endpoint than in the asymptomatic group (2.5% versus 0.9%, respectively; p = 0.060).
CONCLUSIONS: An evaluation was conducted on the in-hospital outcomes of 1158 patients at a single center who underwent CAS and was performed by trained physicians who were supervised by a senior neurovascular interventionist with over 20 years of experience, confirming the excellent safety profile of this procedure with a low rate of complications.
