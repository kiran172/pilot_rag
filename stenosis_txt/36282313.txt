Title: Editorial comment: Changes in high-resolution vessel wall imaging features before and after PTAS for severe intracranial artery stenosis: predicting clinical outcomes within one year.

Abstract: • Periprocedural HR-VWI plays an important role in the prediction of one-year outcomes of SICAS patients who underwent PTAS.• The study further expands the application of lesion wall enhancement on HR-VWI as a predictor of RCIS after PTAS.
