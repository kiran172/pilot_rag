Title: Pacemaker Lead-induced Tricuspid Valve Stenosis and Reverse Lutembacher Syndrome.

Abstract: Reverse Lutembacher syndrome is a rare cause of hypoxia characterized by the triad of tricuspid valve stenosis, elevated right atrial pressure, and an interatrial right-to-left shunt. We report a case of pacemaker lead-induced reverse Lutembacher syndrome in a 45-year-old woman who presented with dyspnea. The patient also developed pacemaker lead-induced superior vena cava obstruction accompanied by a right-to-left shunt through systemic-to-pulmonary venous collaterals, which exacerbated the hypoxia. Tricuspid valve replacement using a bioprosthetic valve and patent foramen ovale closure improved her hypoxia.
