Title: Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome-associated pathogenic MAP2K1 variants activate autophagy.

Abstract: MAP2K1 encodes mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MEK1). Mutations in MAP2K1 lead to continuous activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway, giving rise to cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome (CFCS). However, the molecular mechanisms of abnormal activation of MEK/ERK signaling pathway and the role of autophagy, if any, in manifesting CFCS in MAP2K mutants remain unclear. Here, we report three Chinese children with CFCS having MAP2K1 pathogenic variants, identified by exome sequencing. They presented with dysmorphic facial features, seizures, psychomotor retardation, and short stature. Additionally, the third child showed pulmonary valve stenosis, multiple skeletal deformities, and osteoporosis. Whole exome sequencing revealed two heterozygous missense mutations in exon 3 of MAP2K1 (c.383G>T; p.Gly128Val and c.389A>G; p.Tyr130Cys), as well as a novel heterozygous missense variant (c.170A>T; p.Lys57Met) in exon 2 of MAP2K1. In SH-SY5Y cells, we identified, for the first time, that MAP2K1 mutations can activate the p-ERK-dependent cell cycle progression and autophagy, and cause CFCS. Our results extended the mutational spectrum of MAP2K1, examined the role of MEK1 protein in nerve cell functions, and demonstrated, for the first time, that autophagy may mediate the altered MAP2K1 function, leading to CFCS phenotypes.
