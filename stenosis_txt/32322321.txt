Title: Aftermath of pulmonary tuberculosis: computed tomography assessment.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) has clinically significant sequelae, even after recommended treatment completion. It is important to recognise these sequelae for accurate assessment of severity and treatment planning, if indicated.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We retrospectively analysed contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans of chest of 100 patients with previous history of treated pulmonary tuberculosis, excluding those with active pulmonary disease. CT findings were analysed based on parenchymal, airway, pleural, mediastinal, and vascular sequelae of PTB.
RESULTS: Parenchymal sequelae included fibrosis with architectural distortion and volume loss (90%), cavities (21%) (with aspergillomas noted in 19% of these cases), and tuberculomas (54%). Airway involvement was noted as bronchiectasis (77%) and bronchial stenosis (4%) but none with broncholithiasis. Mediastinal sequelae included lymph node calcification (74%), fibrosing mediastinitis (1%), and pericardial tuberculosis (2%). Pleural sequelae included pleural thickening (22%), with 40.9% of these patients showing calcifications, and one patient with chronic chylous pleural effusion. Vascular sequelae included Rasmussen aneurysms (4%), enlarged bronchial arteries (3%), and systemic bronchial collaterals in 1% of our patients.
CONCLUSIONS: PTB has multiple appalling sequelae, which require due attention and appropriate treatment in symptomatic cases. Radiological evaluation forms an integral part in patient assessment and decision making.
