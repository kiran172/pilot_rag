Title: Percutaneous transseptal transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implantation under endovascular cerebral protection.

Abstract: Various interventional and minimally invasive surgical approaches are currently available for the treatment of mitral valve pathologies. However, only a few of these options are applicable in patients with previously operated on mitral valves. In this case report, we provide detailed insight into the step-by-step guidance of a percutaneous transseptal transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve implant under cerebral protection in a patient with a deteriorated surgically implanted mitral bioprosthesis.
