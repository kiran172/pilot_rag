Title: Prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis and reclassification of cardiovascular risk in Spanish population by coronary computed tomography angiography: EVA study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A more complete assessment of coronary artery disease (CAD) can be performed by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). The aim was to assess the prevalence, distribution and characteristics of coronary artery disease (CAD) and the reclassification of cardiovascular risk by CCTA in an asymptomatic Spanish population.
DESIGN: We included, in a cross-sectional study, 501 random subjects from asymptomatic population, aged 35 and 75. Risk factors, target organ damage and cardiovascular risk were assessed. CCTA was offered to measure the coronary artery calcium score(CACS), segment involvement score(SIS) and segment stenosis score(SSS). The offer was accepted by 220 subjects (44%), with a mean age of 58 ± 14 years, 56% of them male.
RESULTS: The mean CACS was 119.6 ± 381.7 (median (IQR) (0 (0-61.55))), with higher scores in males (191.9 ± 493.1) than females (26.1 ± 73.3; P < .01). CCTA revealed coronary atherosclerosis in 89 cases, 40% (CI95%:34%-46%) in global, 51% in male and 25% in female, of which 13 had obstructive lesions (5.9%). Mean SIS was 1.5 ± 2.5 and SSS 1.2 ± 3.1. When the CACS was included in the CAD risk scale, there was a reclassification of 24%, and when using the SIS percentile, it was 38%, with a 9% increase in risk in both cases.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of CAD in asymptomatic Spanish population was 40%, with greater proportion among males. The incorporation of CACS and SIS in the assessment of cardiovascular risk allows reclassifying subjects who are at low or moderate risk and thus identify those with high cardiovascular risk and also the other way.
