Title: The addition of body weight supported treadmill training to manual therapy and exercise in the management of Hip osteoarthritis: A case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with mild-to-moderate hip OA can present with pain, a decline in function, altered gait mechanics, and pain with ambulation. Body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) has been utilized for patients with total hip arthroplasty, hip fracture, and lumbar spinal stenosis. The purpose of this case series was to report the outcomes of patients with hip OA that received guideline adherent physical therapy care with the addition of BWSTT. Our aim was to assess changes in pain, disability, and physical performance.
CASE DESCRIPTIONS: Seven patients participated in eight 1-h treatment sessions consisting of: manual therapy, therapeutic exercise, and BWSTT. Pre- and post-treatment outcome measures included: average pain rating via the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NPRS), Western Ontario and McMasters Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and the Global Rate of Change (GROC). Physical performance measures included: 6-minute walk test (6MWT), stair climbing test, and 5 time sit-stand.
OUTCOMES: The mean improvement in NPRS score for all subjects was 2.9 points. Mean improvement on the WOMAC was 18.5 + 24.8 pts, and the mean GROC score was +5.0 indicating a rating of "quite a bit better." The mean increase in 6MWT distance was 60.5 + 80.1 meters (median 39 m, range -3 to 230).
CONCLUSIONS: Though patients participating in a multimodal rehabilitation approach including manual therapy, exercise, and BWSTT demonstrated clinically important improvements in pain and function, these changes may not correspond with gait endurance improvements in the short term.
