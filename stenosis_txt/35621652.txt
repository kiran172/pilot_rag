Title: Association between Vascular Calcification and Esophagojejunal Anastomotic Complications after Total Gastrectomy for Gastric Cancer: A Propensity-Matched Study.

Abstract: Esophagojejunal anastomosis (EJA) complications after total gastrectomy are related to significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between arterial calcifications and EJA complications such as leak and stricture for gastric cancer. Between January 2014 and October 2019, 30 patients with EJA complications after total gastrectomy were enrolled and matched to 30 patients without complications through retrospective data review. Arterial calcification grade on preoperative computed tomography (CT) was reported in the abdominal aorta and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) as “absent”, “minor”, or “major”, and in the jejunal vascular arcade (JVA) and left inferior phrenic artery (LIPA) as “absent” or “present”. A Chi-square test was used to compare the variables between the two groups. p-Value < 0.050 was considered statistically significant. Among 30 patients, the numbers of patients with leak and stricture were 23 and seven, respectively. Aortic calcifications were not associated with EJA complications regardless of their grade (p = 0.440). Only major SMA calcifications were associated with EJA complications, as they were present in five patients (16.7%) in the complication group and absent in the non-complication group (p = 0.020). Major SMA calcifications were more related to anastomotic stricture than leak. Three (13.0%) out of 23 patients with leak and two (28.6%) out of seven with stricture had major SMA calcifications (p = 0.028). No calcifications were detected in the JVA or LIPA in any of the 60 patients. Major SMA calcifications were found to be associated with EJA complications, especially in stricture.
