Title: Blood Flow of Au-Nanofluid Using Sisko Model in Stenotic Artery with Porous Walls and Viscous Dissipation Effect.

Abstract: Nanofluids are extremely useful to investigators due to their greater heat transfer rates, which have significant applications in multiple industries. The primary objective of this article is to look into the effect of viscous dissipation in Sisko nano liquid flow with gold Au nanoparticles on a porous stenosis artery. Heat transfer properties were explored. Blood was utilized as a base fluid for nanoparticles. To renovate the governing nonlinear PDEs into nonlinear ODEs, appropriate transformations were used. The bvp4c-based shooting method, via MATLAB, was used to determine the numerical results of the nonlinear ODEs. Furthermore, flow forecasts for each physical quantity were explored. To demonstrate the physical influences of flow constraints versus presumed flow fields, physical explanations were used. The findings demonstrated that the velocity contour improved as the volume fraction, curvature, power law index, and material parameter upsurged. For the Prandtl number, the volume fraction of nanoparticles, the index of the power law, and the temperature profile of the nanofluid declined. Furthermore, the drag force and transfer of the heat were also investigated as explanations for influences on blood flow. Further, the Nusselt number reduced and the drag force enhanced as the curvature parameter values increased. The modeling and numerical solutions play an impressive role in predicting the cause of atherosclerosis.
