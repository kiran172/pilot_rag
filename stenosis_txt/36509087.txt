Title: Type II Left Pulmonary Artery Sling Associated with Double-Outlet Right Ventricle Diagnosed by Fetal Echocardiography and Postnatal Computer Tomography.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Left pulmonary artery sling (LPAS) is a rare congenital vascular anomaly which can be isolated or associated with other malformations. Patients with LPAS usually have symptoms of airway obstruction.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of LPAS with double-outlet right ventricle diagnosed by fetal echocardiography at 33 weeks' gestation. Postnatal computed tomography echocardiography confirmed the diagnosis. Additional bronchial bridge and left main bronchial stenosis found by computed tomography led to a diagnosis of type II LPAS.
CONCLUSION: It is crucial to trace pulmonary artery branches in the prenatal diagnosis. Prenatal diagnosis of LPAS will facilitate postnatal care and timely treatment.
