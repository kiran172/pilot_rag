Title: The associations between coronary artery disease, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by computed tomography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in recognition as a hepatic condition that is unrelated to significant alcoholic consumption, but has rather, been suggested to constitute cardiovascular risk (irrespective of traditional risk factors and high-risk plaque features). Both coronary artery disease and NAFLD share the same pathophysiology and metabolic profile. NAFLD can theoretically be a source/initiator for coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to study the association between NAFLD, CAD, the presence of high-risk plaque features, and the severity of stenosis.
RESULTS: We recruited 800 patients with suspected obstructive CAD and planned for coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), Exclusion criteria: heavy alcohol consumption; contraindications to contrast media; unevaluated coronary-artery segments; other known liver disease; and use of oral corticosteroids and/or amiodarone. Non-enhanced Computed Tomography abdomen was performed before the CCTA to detect NAFLD. To study the association between NAFLD and the presence of CAD, patients were classified as to either have, or not have CAD. The CAD group were then further studied for the presence of high-risk plaque features: napkin ring sign, Positive remodelling, Low Hounsfield unit (HU), and Spotty calcium; and their association with NAFLD. Thirty-two per cent of patients had NAFLD and 45% had CAD. A significant association between NAFLD and CAD was found (OR 4.21, 95% CI (confidence interval) (2.83-6.25), p = 0.000). In CAD patients, significant associations were present between NAFLD and high-risk plaque features: Napkin ring sign, Positive remodelling, Low HU, and Spotty calcium (OR 7.88, 95% CI (4.39-14.12), p < 0.001, OR 5.84, 95% (3.85-8.85), p < 0.001, OR 7.25, 95% CI (3.31-15.90), p < 0.001 and OR 6.66, 95% CI (3.75-11.82), p < 0.001), respectively. NAFLD was present in 39.30%, 50.00%, 20.00%, 54.50% and 100.00% of patients with CAD; and 1-24%; 25-49%; 50-69%; 7 = 0-99%, LMD (Left Main Disease) > 50% stenosis or 3V disease, and Total occlusion, respectively, p < 0.001.
CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD is strongly associated with CAD, high-risk plaque features and higher grade of stenosis.
