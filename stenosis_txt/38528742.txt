Title: Endoscopic treatment for early duodenal papillary carcinoma: long-term outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: This study aims to determine whether endoscopic papillectomy (EP) is a safe and effective treatment for early duodenal papillary carcinoma with long-term follow-up.
METHODS: From June 2012 to September 2022, 48 patients with early duodenal papilloma carcinoma who received endoscopic treatment were included. The histological types, percentage of complete resections, postoperative residuals, adverse events, and recurrences were evaluated.
RESULTS: EP was successful in all patients; 46 were lumped, and two were fragmented, with a 95.8% intact removal rate (46/48). The preoperative biopsy pathological positive rate was 70.8% (34/48). The incidence of early postoperative adverse events (within 1 month after EP) were 16.7% (8/48), including four cases of acute pancreatitis, three cases of delayed bleeding, and one case of acute cholangitis. In addition, 4.2% (2/48) of the late adverse events were bile duct stenosis. After 6 months, the postoperative residual rate was 0%. The median time to recurrence was 17.5 months, and the postoperative recurrence rate was 16.7% (8/48) in patients treated with radiofrequency ablation. The median progression-free survival was 18.6 months (95% CI, 12.1-25.1), and the median overall survival was 121.5 months (95% CI, 105.6-120.9).
CONCLUSIONS: EP is a safe and efficient alternative therapy for early duodenal papillary carcinoma. Endoscopic follow-up and treatment are essential because of the potential for recurrence.
