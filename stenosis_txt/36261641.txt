Title: Digital single-operator cholangioscopy to guide selective cannulation of complex biliary strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Selective cannulation and stenting of complex, tight, and/or angulated biliary strictures under endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) can be challenging. Digital single-operator cholangioscopy (SOC) may facilitate guidewire advancement through the stricture with endoscopic visual guidance. We aimed to describe a case series on clinical outcomes of this technique for selective cannulation, when used after failed conventional ERCP attempts.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent therapeutic digital SOC for selective cannulation of biliary strictures after failed conventional ERCP were retrospectively included.
RESULTS: Ten patients with a malignant (n = 6) or benign (n = 4) biliary stricture were included. Digital SOC-assisted selective guidewire insertion and stent placement across the biliary stricture were technically successful in five (50%) patients. Bilirubin levels improved in all patients with technical success. One (10%) patient developed a post-ERCP pancreatitis.
CONCLUSIONS: Technically successful cannulation of biliary strictures with digital SOC was achieved in half of patients in whom cannulation with conventional ERCP failed, sparing them more invasive interventions. Stricture opacification during the failed ERCP was seen in all technically successful SOCs.
