Title: Accuracy of intravascular ultrasound-derived virtual fractional flow reserve (FFR) and FFR derived from computed tomography for functional assessment of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and intravascular ultrasound-derived fractional flow reserve (IVUS-FFR) are two functional assessment methods for coronary stenoses. However, the calculation algorithms for these methods differ significantly. This study aimed to compare the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR and IVUS-FFR using invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) as the reference standard.
METHODS: Six hundred and seventy patients (698 lesions) with known or suspected coronary artery disease were screened for this retrospective analysis between January 2020 and July 2021. A total of 40 patients (41 lesions) underwent intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and FFR evaluations within six months after completing coronary CT angiography were included. Two novel CFD-based models (AccuFFRct and AccuFFRivus) were used to compute the CT-FFR and IVUS-FFR values, respectively. The invasive FFR ≤ 0.80 was used as the reference standard for evaluating the diagnostic performance of CT-FFR and IVUS-FFR.
RESULTS: Both AccuFFRivus and AccuFFRct demonstrated a strong correlation with invasive FFR (R = 0.7913, P < 0.0001; and R = 0.6296, P < 0.0001), and both methods showed good agreement with FFR. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.960 (P < 0.001) for AccuFFRivus and 0.897 (P < 0.001) for AccuFFRct in predicting FFR ≤ 0.80. FFR ≤ 0.80 were predicted with high sensitivity (96.6%), specificity (85.7%), and the Youden index (0.823) using the same cutoff value of 0.80 for AccuFFRivus. A good diagnostic performance (sensitivity 89.7%, specificity 85.7%, and Youden index 0.754) was also demonstrated by AccuFFRct.
CONCLUSIONS: AccuFFRivus, computed from IVUS images, exhibited a high diagnostic performance for detecting myocardial ischemia. It demonstrated better diagnostic power than AccuFFRct, and could serve as an accurate computational tool for ischemia diagnosis and assist in clinical decision-making.
