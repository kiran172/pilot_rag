Title: Evaluation and Management of Secondary Hypertension.

Abstract: Hypertension is a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality globally. Many patients with hypertension have secondary causes of hypertension that merit further evaluation. For example, secondary hypertension can result in target organ damage to the heart, kidneys, and brain independent of the effects of blood pressure. Several causes benefit from targeted therapies to supplement first-line antihypertensive agents. However, secondary hypertension is often underrecognized. The goal of this review is to highlight optimal approaches to the diagnosis and management of common causes of secondary hypertension, including primary aldosteronism, renovascular hypertension, obstructive sleep apnea, and drug-induced hypertension.
