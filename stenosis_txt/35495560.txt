Title: Multivessel Coronary Artery Disease in a Patient With Noncompaction Cardiomyopathy With Coronary Artery-to-Left Ventricle Fistulas.

Abstract: Coexistence of coronary artery-to-left ventricle fistula (CALVF) and noncompaction cardiomyopathy (NCC) is rare in patients with severe multiple coronary stenosis. We report CALVF in a 70-year-old man with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and NCC. Left ventricular ejection fraction may not improve by total revascularization in this condition. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
