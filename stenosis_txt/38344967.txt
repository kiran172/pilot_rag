Title: [Evolution of surgical approaches to carotid bifurcation].

Abstract: Carotid endarterectomy is preferable for prevention of acute cerebrovascular accident associated with atherosclerotic lesions of internal carotid artery. Modern interest in minimizing local complications and small excisions is also actual in carotid surgery. The authors review the modern literature data on evolution of carotid arteries exposure. Cutaneous mini-incision, transverse skin incision and retrojugular approach are discussed. The authors consider the advantages and possible complications of each technique.
