Title: Outcomes and predictive factors for re-stricture with urethroplasty methods for anterior urethra stricture.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We wished to compare the treatment success of urethroplasty methods (EPA and BMG) used for anterior urethra stricture after unsuccessful internal urethrotomy.
METHODS: A total of 85 and 51 patients, respectively, who underwent excision and primary anastomosis (EPA) and buccal mucosal graft (BMG) urethroplasty due to recurrent strictures after direct vision internal urethrotomy (DVIU) were evaluated retrospectively. On the uroflowmetry test, >15 ml/s urine flow and residual urine (PVR) below 50 ml were determined as success criteria. Cox regression analysis investigated the probable predictive factors for surgery success. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed stricture free survival after redo-urethroplasty.
RESULTS: After surgery, EPA and BMG patients were followed for 31.9 ± 9.8 (4-40) and 30.7 ± 10.3 (4-40) months. At the end of this follow-up duration, success was obtained for 71 (83.5%) and 44 (86.3%) patients. Mean re-stricture times were 13.9 ± 6.0 (4-19) and 10.2 ± 5.1 (4-26) months. Most re-strictures had penile location (10 (71.5%) and 7 (100%)). After one session of DVIU, there was 100% success in both groups, but after >3 sessions of DVIU, success fell to 70.3% and 78.3% in the groups respectively. Patients with high numbers of DVIU sessions had longer durations for urethroplasty surgery. Apart from complications related to the donor field in the oral region with BMG and four patients who developed fistula (7.8%), complications were similar in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In this series of cases, it was not possible to identify which of the techniques employed provides the best result or predictive factors for stenosis recurrence after correction procedures for anterior urethral stenosis.
