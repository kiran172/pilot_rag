Title: Image quality and diagnostic performance evaluation in transcatheter aortic valve implantation candidates with atrial fibrillation using a whole-heart coverage CT scanner.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the image quality and diagnostic performance for obstructive coronary artery disease of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) during TAVI planning CT using a whole-heart coverage CT scanner.
METHODS: Eighty-eight consecutive TAVI candidates with AF (50 men, 74 ± 6 years) who underwent both TAVI planning CT and invasive coronary catheter angiography (ICA) were retrospectively analyzed. With ICA results as the reference standard, the accuracy of TAVI planning CT for lesion detection on a per-vessel and per-patient level was calculated. Meanwhile, image quality, contrast volume, and effective dose (ED) were evaluated. A 5-point visual scale (1-5) was used to assess the subjective image quality. The CT value and signal-to-noise ratio were measured for the left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending (LAD), left circumflex (LCX), and right coronary arteries (RCA).
RESULTS: The ED for CCTA was 3.25 ± 1.39 mSv and contrast volume was 58.14 ± 12.34 mL. A total of 1371 (1371/1408 = 97.4%) segments with diameter > 1.5 mm were analyzed. For the subjective evaluation, the mean score was 3.99 ± 0.96 for overall image quality. The mean CT values in LM, RCA, LCX, and LAD were all above 400 HU. For the detection of > 50% stenosis, TAVI planning CT provided on the per-vessel and per-patient basis 97.06% and 100% in sensitivity, 96.23% and 89.06% in specificity, 99.7% and 100% in negative predictive value, and 73.3% and 77.4% in positive predictive value, respectively.
CONCLUSION: TAVI planning CT with whole-heart coverage demonstrates good CCTA image quality and a high sensitivity and NPV in excluding obstructive CAD in TAVI candidates with AF.
KEY POINTS: • Transcatheter aortic valve implantation planning (TAVI) CT with whole-heart coverage enables good image quality of CCTA in TAVI candidates with atrial fibrillation. • Obstructive coronary artery disease may be excluded with high accuracy in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) candidates with atrial fibrillation with the usage of whole-heart coverage TAVI planning CT.
