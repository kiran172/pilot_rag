Title: Angioplasty And stenting For symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease: How I Do It.

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is a common cause of acute ischemic stroke. ICAD has a high rate of recurrent ischemic stroke despite recommended adequate medical treatment. Endovascular treatment of ICAD has been controversial due to high periprocedural complication in historic randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Recently, a multicenter prospective study of stent placement in patients with high grade intracranial stenosis that evaluated safety and efficacy of Balloon-mounted stents (BMS) in symptomatic ICAD showed low rates of periprocedural stroke (5.6%) than the SAMMPRIS (14.7%) and VISSIT (21.4%) trials. This review highlights the recent evolution of endovascular therapy for symptomatic ICAD.
