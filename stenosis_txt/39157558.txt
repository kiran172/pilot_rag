Title: Chronic Total Occlusion of the Left Main and Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Concomitant aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease in the elderly population is frequent and the proper therapeutic approach is a matter of debate. We present 2 challenging cases of patients affected by severe aortic stenosis and chronic total occlusion of the left main, demonstrating the safety and feasibility of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, performed both with balloon-expandable and self-expanding valves.
