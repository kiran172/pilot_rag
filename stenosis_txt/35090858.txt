Title: Pembrolizumab Improves Survival After Resection of Intracardiac Metastatic Cervical Carcinoma.

Abstract: Intracardiac metastasis of cervical squamous cell carcinoma (C-SCC) is rare, with historically poor long-term survival. We report the case of a 55-year-old woman with prior metastatic C-SCC who was found to have a right ventricular mass causing functional pulmonic stenosis and multiple pulmonary emboli 19 months after her initial diagnosis. She underwent surgical resection to prevent further embolization and heart failure. Pathology confirmed metastatic C-SCC and she was maintained on adjuvant pembrolizumab. She remained well 32 months later without further disease progression. Surgical resection of intracardiac metastasis of C-SCC combined with pembrolizumab therapyÂ may result in improved postoperative life expectancy.
