Title: Findings on drug-induced sleep endoscopy in infants with laryngomalacia.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is highly prevalent in infants with laryngomalacia (LM). Previous studies have reported high rates of persistent OSA following supraglottoplasty (SGP). The objective of this study is to describe the findings on drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) in infants with LM.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed including infants (12.5 months of age or less) with LM who underwent DISE along with direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy (DLB). Data collected included clinical presentation, swallow study results, sleep study results, past medical and surgical history, and postoperative outcomes when follow-up data was available. The findings on DISE as well as DLB were reviewed and described.
RESULTS: Thirty-five infants were included in the study with a mean age of 0.42 years (range 0.04-1.04). Obstructive sleep-disordered breathing (oSDB) and/or OSA were identified in 26 patients (74.3%) in addition to 7 patients (20%) with noisy breathing during sleep. DISE demonstrated LM in 31 patients (89%). DISE identified 12 patients (34%) with partial or complete obstruction at the level of the tongue base. DLB identified 14 patients (40%) with a secondary airway abnormality including 7 patients (20%) with type 1 laryngeal cleft and 4 patients (11%) with grade 1 subglottic stenosis. Eighteen patients (51%) underwent SGP.
CONCLUSION: DISE at the time of airway endoscopy for infants with LM can be helpful in identifying additional sites of obstruction including the tongue base. Glossoptosis may explain and/or predict the previously reported persistence of OSA following SGP. Additionally, DISE can complement awake flexible laryngoscopy in the assessment of severity of LM.
