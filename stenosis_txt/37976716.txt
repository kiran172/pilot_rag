Title: Prolapse of duodenal bulb from esophageal hiatal hernia: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The number of patients with hiatal hernia has increased. Paraesophageal and mixed hiatal hernias are absolute indications for surgical treatment due to the possibility of blood flow disturbances to the stomach and other organs.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 77-year-old woman with a history of type IV esophageal hiatal hernia (under observation), multiple operations presented with a chief complaint of vomiting. She was diagnosed with a type IV esophageal hiatal hernia with incarceration of the duodenal bulb into the mediastinum. Although the incarceration was relieved with conservative treatment, the patient was at a high risk for recurrence; therefore, surgical hernia repair was performed. Intraoperatively, the hernia portal was severely dilated and the duodenal bulb was easily accessible to the mediastinum due to its high mobility. Fundoplication was performed using the Toupet procedure. No stenosis at the fundoplication site was observed on intraoperative upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.
DISCUSSION: The causes of prolapse and incarceration of the duodenal bulb into the mediastinum were speculated to be weakening of the tissue due to aging, adhesion of the omentum to the hernia portal due to chronic prolapse of the stomach toward the mediastinum, increased intra-abdominal pressure due to a rounded back, and anatomical shortening of the distance between the esophageal hiatus and the duodenal bulb. The Toupet method was used as it is associated with a lower incidence of dysphagia.
CONCLUSION: Further investigation is needed to determine the best surgical technique.
