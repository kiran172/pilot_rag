Title: Retrograde enteroclysis by double balloon enteroscopy in a patient with blunt abdominal trauma: small bowel stricture, intraluminal vascular lesion and Crohn's disease.

Abstract: A 40-year-old male presented to the Emergency Department after a driving accident with blunt abdominal trauma. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a mesenteric injury in the right lower quadrant. He was admitted two months later due to a one-day history of abdominal pain and diarrhea, without fever or blood. The CT angiography showed a pseudoaneurysm located in the proximal ileum and several rigid small bowel (SB) loops with segmental wall thickening of mucosa.
