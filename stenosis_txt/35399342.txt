Title: Endovascular treatment of central vein occlusion in patients with functioning arteriovenous fistulas.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The increased survival of dialysis patients and the inability to obtain sufficient organs to meet demand for transplantation, compounded by poor access to health services, have caused the transplant waiting lists to grow, extending the time spent using central venous accesses for hemodialysis. The most common etiology of central vein stenosis is prolonged central venous access, due to intimal injuries caused by the presence of the catheter.
OBJECTIVES: To assess the results of angioplasty to treat central vein occlusion in patients with functioning peripheral arteriovenous fistulas.
METHODS: Retrospective cohort study with review of medical records from 47 patients with stenotic or occlusive lesions. Patients were assessed at 30 days, 6 months, and 1 year after recanalization or correction of stenosis with transluminal percutaneous angioplasty (TPA) or TPA/stenting.
RESULTS: Stenotic lesions were detected in 25 patients (53%) and occlusions were found in 22 (47%) patients. TPA with stenting was used in 64% of patients and balloon angioplasty in isolation was used in 36%. Analysis of clinical results showed a high rate of early clinical improvement (30 days), seen in 82% of patients (confidence interval [CI] 71-93%). After 1 year of follow-up, the primary patency rate was 57% and the assisted primary patency rate was 72% (CI 57-84%).
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular treatment of central vein stenosis or occlusions suggests clinical improvement of symptoms and adequate rates of patency at 1 year, notwithstanding the limited sample size.
