Title: Incidence and risk factors for early gastrojejunostomy anastomotic stricture requiring endoscopic intervention following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass: a MBSAQIP analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastrojejunostomy (GJ) stricture is one of the most commonly recognized complications following laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). The risks involving the formation of early GJ stomal stenosis are largely unknown. The aims of this study are to evaluate the rate and risk factors associated with GJ stricture in patients requiring esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) within 30 days after LRYGB.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients who underwent EGD for GJ stricture following LRYGB. Data were retrieved from MBSAQIP database from 2015 to 2018. Descriptive, bivariate, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Those who had reoperation, readmission, and intervention for other indications rather than GJ stricture were excluded from the risk factor analysis.
RESULTS: 760,076 patients underwent bariatric surgery. Of these, 184,660 (24.3%) underwent LRYGB and 875 had GJ stricture within 30 days postoperatively. The overall incidence of early GJ stricture after LRYGB was 4.7 per 1000 person-years. The incidence decreased from 6.2 to 3.4 per 1000 person-years during the 4-year period. 85% of patients with GJ stricture required therapeutic intervention. Median (IQR) day to the first endoscopic intervention was 25 (21-28) days. The overall 30-day readmission rate was 40%. 30-day reoperation rate due to GJ stricture was 5.6%. No 30-day mortality occurred. Factors independently associated with an increased risk for early GJ stricture include concurrent hiatal hernia repair (Adjusted Odds Ratio-AOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.5-2.2), revision case (AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.6), African American (AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.7), gastroesophageal reflux disease-GERD (AOR 1.4, 95% CI 1.2-1.5), drain placement (AOR 1.3, 95% CI1.1-1.4), and routine postoperative swallow study (AOR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.50).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of early GJ stricture following LRYGB decreased at MBSAQIP-accredited centers over the review period. Patients having additional manipulation at or around GJ were at risk of developing early GJ stricture after LRYGB.
