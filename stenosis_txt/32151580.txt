Title: Intraoperative Fluid Balance and Perioperative Outcomes After Aortic Valve Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of intraoperative fluid balance on postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) in cardiac surgical patients is poorly defined.
METHODS: In this retrospective study of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, the primary outcome of interest was postoperative AKI. Secondary outcomes were postoperative fluid balance, cardiac index, vasopressor use, hospital-free days, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospital readmission, and 30- and 90-day mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 2327 patients were analyzed. Positive intraoperative fluid balance was associated with lower odds of AKI; the lowest odds were in the 20- to 39-mL/kg group (odds ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.38-0.81; PÂ = .002). Positive intraoperative fluid balance was associated with a lower postoperative fluid balance. Increased ultrafiltration volume was associated with increased postoperative fluid resuscitation and vasopressor use. AKI was associated with increased 30- and 90-day mortality. Increased fluid balance was associated with increased odds of myocardial infarction and 30-day mortality. Increased ultrafiltration volume was associated with increased odds of 30- and 90-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients who underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, positive intraoperative fluid balance was associated with decreased odds of AKI. Patients developing AKI had increased 30- and 90-day mortality. Although the overall incidence was low, increased intraoperative fluid balance was associated with myocardial infarction and 30-day mortality, whereas increased ultrafiltration volume was associated with 30- and 90-day morality. Prospective studies are needed to better define proper intraoperative fluid management in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
