Title: Multiparametric ultrasound for upper extremity dialysis access evaluation.

Abstract: The evolution of ultrasound (US) techniques has greatly improved the evaluation of many parameters in dialysis vascular access, which is typically achieved through an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG). These techniques include grayscale B-mode, color Doppler, power Doppler, spectral Doppler, non-Doppler US flow imaging techniques, contrast-enhanced US, and elastography. In conjunction with a patient's medical history and physical examination, US provides crucial information about the native vascular bed prior to the surgical creation of an arteriovenous anastomosis. It also tracks the maturation progress of the newly created AVF or AVG and aids in diagnosing potential complications of the vascular access. These complications include thrombosis, steal syndrome, aneurysms, pseudoaneurysms, hematomas, infection, ischemic neuropathy, exacerbation of preexisting congestive heart failure, and stenosis.
