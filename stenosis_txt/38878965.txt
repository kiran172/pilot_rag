Title: Role of Empagliflozin in heart failure with severe aortic stenosis before valve replacement: EASTER-HF study.

Abstract: We evaluated empagliflozin in severe DAS patients with HF before AVR. HF patients with LVEF 30-80 % and NYHA functional class II-IV symptoms got empagliflozin 10 mg or not within 6 months before AVR, along with SOC. Adding empagliflozin to the SOC before AVR reduced HF death or HHF by 73 % after 6-months in a group of 20 patients (RR 0.27; p = 0.022). Improving LVEF (+3.48 %, p < 0.001) and NT-proBNP levels (-3974.6 pg/mL) with empagliflozin in SOC before AVR significantly reduced in-hospital and 6-month mortality in this patient group. In severe DAS and HF patients, empagliflozin improved symptoms and prognosis.
