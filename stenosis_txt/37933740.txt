Title: Mucosal Microbiome Disruption in Acute Laryngeal Injury Following Intubation.

Abstract: The objective of this study was to characterize mucosal microbial shifts in patients with acute laryngeal injury (ALgI) after intubation. This cross-sectional study included 20 patients with ALgI who underwent early endoscopic intervention with tissue culture, 20 patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) who underwent tissue culture during the routine endoscopic intervention, and 3 control patients who underwent mucosal swab culture. 70% of the ALgI patients had a positive culture compared to 5% of the iSGS patients and none of the controls. The most identified microbes isolated from ALgI patients included Staphylococcus species in 30% and Streptococcus species in 25%. The high rate of pathologic bacterial infiltration into postintubation laryngeal wounds supports efforts to reduce bacterial colonization of endotracheal tubes and highlights the role of culture-directed antibiotic therapy as a part of early intervention to improve outcomes for patients with ALgI.
