Title: Neutrophil-to-serum iron ratio as a promising inflammatory biomarker for acute myocardial infarction and Gensini score.

Abstract: Background: We aim to investigate whether the neutrophil-to-serum iron ratio (N/SI) is a promising biomarker for acute myocardial infarction group (AMI) and Gensini score. Methods: A total of 263 patients were enrolled and divided into four groups. The Gensini score was used to gauge the severity of coronary artery stenosis, and inflammatory biomarkers were calculated. Results: The N/SI was substantially higher in the AMI group than those in other groups, and N/SI was an independent risk factor for AMI. In ROC analyses, N/SI had the highest area under curve (AUC) for AMI among those inflammatory biomarkers. N/SI was also proved to be related with Gensini score. Conclusion: N/SI was discovered to be a new and effective inflammatory biomarker for AMI and Gensini score.
