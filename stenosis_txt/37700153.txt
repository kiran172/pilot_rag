Title: Definitive chemoradiation in vulvar squamous cell carcinoma: outcome and toxicity from an observational multicenter Italian study on vulvar cancer (OLDLADY 1.1).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Vulvar carcinoma is a rather uncommon gynecological malignancy affecting elderly women and the treatment of loco-regional advanced carcinoma of the vulva (LAVC) is a challenge for both gynecologic and radiation oncologists. Definitive chemoradiation (CRT) is the treatment of choice, but with disappointing results. In this multicenter study (OLDLADY-1.1), several institutions have combined their retrospective data on LAVC patients to produce a real-world dataset aimed at collecting data on efficacy and safety of CRT.
METHODS: The primary study end-point was 2-year-local control (LC), secondary end-points were 2-year-metastasis free-survival (MFS), 2-year-overall survival (OS) and the rate and severity of acute and late toxicities. Participating centers were required to fill data sets including age, stage, histology, grading as well as technical/dosimetric details of CRT. Data about response, local and regional recurrence, acute and late toxicities, follow-up and outcome measures were also collected. The toxicity was a posteriori documented through the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5 scale.
RESULTS: Retrospective analysis was performed on 65 patients with primary or recurrent LAVC treated at five different radiation oncology institutions covering 11-year time interval (February 2010-November 2021). Median age at diagnosis was 72 years (range 32-89). With a median follow-up of 19 months (range 1-114 months), 2-year actuarial LC, MFS and OS rate were 43.2%, 84.9% and 59.7%, respectively. In 29 patients (44%), CRT was temporarily stopped (median 5 days, range 1-53 days) due to toxicity. The treatment interruption was statistically significant at univariate analysis of factors predicting LC (p: 0.05) and OS rate (p: 0.011), and it was confirmed at the multivariate analysis for LC rate (p: 0.032). In terms of toxicity profile, no G4 event was recorded. Most adverse events were reported as grade 1 or 2. Only 14 acute G3 toxicities, all cutaneous, and 7 late G3 events (3 genitourinary, 3 cutaneous, and 1 vaginal stenosis) were recorded.
CONCLUSION: In the context of CRT for LAVC, the present study reports encouraging results even if there is clearly room for further improvements, in terms of both treatment outcomes, toxicity and treatment interruption management.
