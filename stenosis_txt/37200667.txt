Title: Outcomes of Orbital Atherectomy for the Treatment of Severely Calcified Coronary Artery Lesions.

Abstract: Background Orbital atherectomy (OA) is used to prepare severely calcified coronary artery lesions before percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is used to determine the plaque volume and degree of stenosis within the arterial vessel. This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of OA for treating severely calcified coronary lesions and determined if IVUS impacted these outcomes. Methods We retrospectively collected data from a single center of patients with severe coronary artery calcification who underwent OA. The data on baseline characteristics and procedural and clinical outcomes were collected and analyzed. Results A total of 374 patients underwent OA. The mean age was 69 Â± 12.7; 53.6% were Black, and 38% were female. Hypertension was present in 96% of the patients, followed by hyperlipidemia in 79.4%, diabetes mellitus in 53.7%, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in 22.7%. More patients had presented with a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) compared to ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) at 36.3% versus 4.3%, respectively. The radial artery was used in 35.4% of the cases, and the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was the most commonly treated vessel with OA at 61%, followed by the right coronary artery (RCA) at 30.7%. IVUS was utilized in 63.4% of cases. The most common complication of the procedure was perforation and dissection at an equal proportion of 1.3% among all patients. The no-reflow rate was 0.5%, and 0.5% developed post-procedural myocardial infarction (MI). The average length of stay was 4.7 days, while a marginal proportion, at 10.5%, had same-day discharge with no recorded complications. Conclusion In this analysis of patients with severely calcified coronary lesions, OA had low rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and was considered a safe and effective treatment for complex coronary lesions.
