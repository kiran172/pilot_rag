Title: Symptomatic Chronic Severe Stenosis of the Iliac Vein Successfully Treated Endovascularly Using an Interventional Radiology Computed Tomography System.

Abstract: We report a woman with chronic severe stenosis of the left common and external iliac veins and severe post-thrombotic syndrome symptoms. We successfully recanalized the stenotic segment via interventional radiology, which immediately relieved the symptoms. The interventional radiology computed tomography system was helpful for the safe and precise performance of endovascular treatments.
