Title: Management of Innominate Artery Occlusion With Severe Left Common Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Innominate artery occlusion is a rare entity, particularly when coupled with severe left common carotid artery stenosis. Innominate artery disease may present with varying degrees of symptomatology and can place patients at risk for both posterior fossa and hemispheric ischemic events. We present a symptomatic case of innominate artery occlusion with severe left common carotid disease. We reviewed the literature and current options for the treatment of innominate artery disease. The patient underwent successful hybrid repair with left carotid artery retrograde stenting and left carotid artery to right carotid artery bypass. She has been symptom and re-intervention free during her one-year follow-up. We describe a successful hybrid repair of symptomatic innominate artery occlusion with concomitant severe left carotid artery stenosis in a patient with a prohibitive open thoracic surgical risk.
