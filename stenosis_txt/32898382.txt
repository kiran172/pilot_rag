Title: Morphometric and traditional frailty assessment in transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Frailty is common amongst patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). The aim of this study was to determine the prognostic relevance of newer objective and traditional measures of frailty after TAVI.
METHODS: Consecutive patients were identified from the Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust TAVI database. Frailty was quantified objectively by measuring the total psoas muscle area (TPMA) on routine computer tomography scans and compared against Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Score, Katz Index of independence in activities of daily living and Clinician Estimated Poor Mobility. Postintervention morbidity and mortality were examined between these scoring systems.
RESULTS: The current study included 420 patients who had undergone TAVI between January 2013 and December 2015. Median clinical follow-up was 4.0 years (interquartile range 2.9-5.0). Standardized measurements of the TPMA were not associated with either postintervention morbidity or mortality. Only the Canadian Study of Health and Aging Clinical Frailty Score was associated with hospital stay (adjusted regression coefficient 0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.04-1.36, P = 0.038) and overall all-cause mortality (adjusted regression coefficient 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.05-1.50, P = 0.013). There were no significant correlations between TPMA and any of the traditional frailty tools.
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate TPMA to be a poor measure of patient frailty when compared with traditional methods of assessment which failed to predict postintervention outcomes. Furthermore, morphometric sarcopaenia correlated poorly with established measures of frailty.
