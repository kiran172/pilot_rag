Title: Coagulation of the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds as an alternative to aryepiglottic fold release in management of type 2 laryngomalacia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endoscopic supraglottoplasty is the procedure of choice in treatment of laryngomalacia with CO2 laser and cold steel being the most common instruments used with excellent results. However, bleeding, supraglottic stenosis and aspiration may occur leading to serious complications. Using coblation in management of laryngomalacia was found to be beneficial. Therefore, we conducted this study to evaluate the outcome of supraglottoplasty done by coagulation using coblation of the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds as an alternative technique to aryepiglottic fold release in management of type 2 laryngomalacia.
METHODS: Retrospective study was conducted at Mansoura University Hospitals; Egypt from November 2017 to March 2018 included patients diagnosed with severe type 2 laryngomalacia. Supraglottoplasty was done by using coblator applied to the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds allowing for lateral scarring thus widening the airway, preventing supraglottic collapse and avoiding re-stenosis. Outcome measures included assessment of presence or absence of the following symptoms preoperatively and postoperatively: inspiratory stridor, failure to thrive, choking and cyanosis. Preoperative and postoperative lowest oxygen saturation levels, weight-by-age percentile, and need for tracheostomy were assessed.
RESULTS: Nine patients were included in this study with a mean age of 3.78 ± 1.20 months (range 2-6 months). Overall success rate was 89%. The most significantly improved symptom was stridor (p-value 0.008). Significant improvement in lowest oxygen saturation levels (from 89.11 ± 3.06% pre-operatively to 96.44 ± 3.50% post-operatively) and weight gain (from 4288.9 ± 643.1 gm. preoperatively to 5505.55 ± 1017.4 gm. 1 month postoperatively) was achieved. No detected re-stenosis on follow up and none of our cases needed tracheostomy.
CONCLUSION: Supraglottoplasty by coagulation of the lateral surface of aryepiglottic folds using coblation is an effective and safe technique and can improve airway symptoms and weight gain in patients with type 2 laryngomalacia.
