Title: Underlying mechanisms of thrombus formation/growth in atherothrombosis and deep vein thrombosis.

Abstract: Thrombosis remains a leading cause of death worldwide despite technological advances in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. The traditional view of arterial thrombus formation is that it is a platelet-dependent process, whereas that of venous thrombus formation is a coagulation-dependent process. Current pathological and basic studies on atherothrombosis and venous thrombosis have revealed the diverse participation of platelet and coagulation activation mechanisms in both thrombus initiation and growth processes during clinical thrombotic events. Atherosclerotic plaque cell-derived tissue factor contributes to fibrin formation and platelet aggregation. The degree of plaque disruption and a blood flow alteration promote atherothrombotic occlusion. While blood stasis/turbulent flow due to luminal stenosis itself initiates venous thrombus formation. The coagulation factor XI-driven propagation phase of blood coagulation plays a major role in venous thrombus growth, but a minor role in hemostasis. These lines of evidence indicate that atherothrombosis onset is affected by the thrombogenic potential of atherosclerotic plaques, the plaque disruption size, and an alteration in blood flow. Upon onset of venous thrombosis, enhancement of the propagation phase of blood coagulation under blood stasis and a hypercoagulable state contribute to large thrombus formation.
