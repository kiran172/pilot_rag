Title: Complete Coronary Revascularization and Outcomes in Patients Who Underwent Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: Insights from The REGROUP Trial.

Abstract: There is growing evidence in support of coronary complete revascularization (CR). Nonetheless, there is no universally accepted definition of CR in patients who undergo coronary bypass grafting surgery (CABG). We sought to investigate the outcomes of CR, defined as surgical revascularization of any territory supplied by a suitable coronary artery with â‰¥50% stenosis. We performed a preplanned subanalysis in the Randomized Trial of Endoscopic or Open Saphenous Vein Graft Harvesting (REGROUP) clinical trial cohort. Of 1,147 patients who underwent CABG, 810 (70.6%) received CR. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including death from any cause, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or repeat revascularization over a median 4.7 years of follow-up. MACE occurred in 175 patients (21.6%) in the CR group and 86 patients (25.5%) in the incomplete revascularization (IR) group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.67 to 1.13, p = 0.29). A total of 97 patients (12.0%) in the CR group and 48 patients (14.2%) in the IR group died (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.32, p = 0.67); nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred in 49 patients (6.0%) in the CR group and 30 patients (8.9%) in the IR group (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.2, p = 0.24), and repeat revascularization occurred in 62 patients (7.7%) in the CR group and 39 patients (11.6%) in the IR group (HR 0.64; 95% CI 0.42 to 0.95, p = 0.027). In conclusion, in patients with a great burden of co-morbidities who underwent CABG in the REGROUP trial over a median follow-up period of a median 4.7 years, CR was associated with similar MACE rates but a reduced risk of repeat revascularization. Longer-term follow-up is warranted.
