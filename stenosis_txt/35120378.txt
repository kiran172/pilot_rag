Title: The Nasolacrimal Drainage System in 143 Children with the Microphthalmos-Anophthalmos Complex.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Report of clinical findings relating to the lacrimal system in congenital clinical anophthalmos and severe blind microphthalmos (MAC-complex patients).
METHODS: A retrospective study of the notes of 207 consecutive patients treated surgically at least once with highly hydrophilic self-inflating expanders for MAC between 1998 and 2021. The lacrimal drainage system was always probed and irrigated under general anaesthesia before any other procedure was started.
RESULTS: 64 patients were excluded due to possible misdiagnosis because of previous lid or orbit surgery elsewhere or due to missing data. The analysis therefore included 67 girls and 76 boys aged between 1 and 126 months (median age: 5 months). 72 patients presented with unilateral and 42 with bilateral anophthalmos, and 24 had unilateral and 5 bilateral microphthalmos; consequently, 286 orbits (of which, 190Â with probable pathology) were available for assessment. In unilateral cases the lacrimal system on the normal side was never affected. On the anophthalmic or microphthalmic side the lacrimal system was normal in 68 orbits only (35.8%). The most frequent finding was canalicular stenosis (91 orbits; 48%). Common canaliculus stenosis was observed in 12 orbits (6.3%) and nasolacrimal duct obstruction in 9 orbits (4.7%). There were four cases of punctal aplasia, but no other anomalies. In unilateral MAC pathologic findings during lacrimal probing were found to be associated with anatomical malformation of the contralateral fellow eye. Only in unilateral anophthalmos there was a significant association with cleft lip and palate, which was not found in the three other groups.
CONCLUSIONS: In congenital clinical anophthalmos the lacrimal system is affected in up to 66.5% of cases, mostly due to canalicular stenosis. Even if there is no clear evidence of an embryological connection, this association is certainly not a random finding.
