Title: Bioprosthetic aortic valve haemodynamic deterioration secondary to a thrombus.

Abstract: A 77-year-old man with a history of coronary artery bypass grafting and surgical aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis 2 years prior presented with exertional chest pain and shortness of breath. The patient underwent a thorough initial evaluation including a transthoracic echocardiogram and coronary angiogram without significant findings. One month later the patient presented with worsened symptoms and a repeat echocardiogram showed an increased mean aortic valve gradient of 87 mm Hg. The patient had to undergo reoperation for a surgical aortic valve replacement and was found to have an aortic bioprosthetic valve thrombus. This case suggests a mismatch between the aortic prosthesis and the patient's aortic root size.
