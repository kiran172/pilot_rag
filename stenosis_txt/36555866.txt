Title: Hypertriglyceridemia and Atherosclerotic Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Both fasting and non-fasting hypertriglyceridemia have emerged as residual risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. However, it is unclear whether hypertriglyceridemia increases the risks of the progression of carotid artery stenosis. Statins are well known to prevent carotid plaque progression and improve carotid plaque instability. In addition, statin therapy is also known to reduce cerebrovascular events in patients with carotid artery stenosis and to improve clinical outcomes in patients undergoing revascularization procedures. On the other hand, there have been no randomized controlled trials showing that the combination of non-statin lipid-lowering drugs with statins has additional beneficial effects over statin monotherapy to prevent cerebrovascular events and stenosis progression in patients with carotid artery stenosis. In this article, the authors demonstrate the mechanisms of atherosclerosis formation associated with hypertriglyceridemia and the potential role of lipid-lowering drugs on carotid artery stenosis. The authors also review the articles reporting the relationships between hypertriglyceridemia and carotid artery stenosis.
