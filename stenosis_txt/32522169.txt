Title: Sex difference in the prognostic role of body composition parameters in Taiwanese patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Evidence on association between body composition and outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is limited for Asian patients. This study investigated the prognostic role of body composition parameters in Taiwanese patients undergoing TAVI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data of consecutive patients undergoing TAVI for severe aortic stenosis between May 1, 2010 and August 31, 2019 were prospectively collected in this observational study. The association between body composition parameters (body mass index [BMI], body surface area [BSA], lean body mass [LBM], and LBM index) and cumulative mortality was analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression model.
RESULTS: A total of 221 patients (mean age 81.4 years), including 125 (56.6%) males, were included with median follow-up duration of 23.8 months. In males, multivariate analysis revealed that higher BMI (P = 0.035), BMI ≥ 20 kg/m2 (P = 0.026), and higher LBM index (P = 0.023) significantly predicted lower overall all-cause cumulative mortality. In females, none of the body composition parameters was significantly associated with all-cause cumulative mortality. Paradoxical association between BMI and estimated all-cause cumulative mortality was only significant among male patients.
CONCLUSION: In Taiwanese TAVI patients, the prognostic effects of BMI and LBM index on cumulative mortality were only observed in males, not in females. Sex differences must be considered when stratifying risk among patients undergoing TAVI.
