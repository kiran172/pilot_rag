Title: Outcomes of aortic valve repair in children stratified by complexity: Which outcome for which lesion?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aortic valvuloplasty frequency has significantly increased over the past 15 years. Surgical repair varies in complexity depending on valvular lesions. Our aim is to report results on the whole spectrum of aortic valvuloplasty techniques.
METHODS: All children who consecutively underwent aortic valvuloplasty for aortic stenosis and/or aortic insufficiency between January 2006 and December 2020 at Necker Sick Children's Hospital (Paris, France) were included in a retrospective cohort study. Aortic valvuloplasty techniques were classified into 3 difficulty levels: (1) simple repair, corresponding to commissurotomy and/or shaving in aortic stenosis (AS) in neonates (group 1) and children >1 month (group 2); (2) intermediate-complexity repair, corresponding to commissuroplasty, leaflet resuspension, and fenestration closure in aortic insufficiency (leaflet prolapse in connective tissue disease, isolated leaflet prolapse and Laubry-Pezzi groups); and (3) complex repair requiring a pericardial patch to restore a functional aortic valve in mixed aortic valve disease (bicuspidization with neocommissure and cusp extension groups).
RESULTS: During the study period, 324 children underwent aortic valvuloplasty. Survival and freedom from aortic valve reintervention at 10 years were, respectively, 86.1% and 50.9% in neonates with AS, 95.2% and 71.7% in children >1 month with AS, 93.8% and 79.5% in leaflet prolapse in connective tissue disease, 97.7% and 91.9% in isolated leaflet prolapse, 100% and 88% in those with Laubry-Pezzi syndrome, 97.4% and 84.8% in bicuspidization with neocommissure, and 100% and 54.2% in the cusp extension.
CONCLUSIONS: Durability of aortic valvuloplasty techniques is satisfactory and offers the possibility to delay the Ross procedure, regardless of the lesion's complexity.
