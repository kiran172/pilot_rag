Title: Rotational, orbital atherectomy and intravascular lithotripsy for coronary calcified nodules: insights from optical coherence tomography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment strategy for coronary calcified nodules (CN) remains uncertain. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of different calcium modification strategies, including rotational atherectomy (RA), orbital atherectomy (OA), and intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) for managing CN with optical coherence tomography (OCT) guidance.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing OCT-guided percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for severely calcified lesions using RA, OA, or IVL between January 2017 and December 2022 were included. Primary endpoint was minimum stent area (MSA) post-PCI. Secondary endpoints included MSA at CN site and 1-year target vessel failure (TVF), defined as a composite of cardiac death, target-vessel myocardial infarction, or target vessel revascularization.
RESULTS: Among 154 patients and 158 lesions, CN was identified in 54 lesions (34.2%) and managed with RA (39%, n = 21), OA (33%, n = 18), or IVL (28%, n = 15). The IVL group exhibited a larger minimal lumen diameter, maximum calcium arc, and maximum calcium thickness. Post-PCI OCT demonstrated comparable MSA (RA: 6.23 ± 0.34 mm², OA: 5.75 ± 0.39 mm², IVL: 6.24 ± 0.46 mm²; p = 0.62) and MSA at CN site (7.17 ± 0.43 mm², 6.46 ± 0.49 mm², 7.86 ± 0.56 mm², respectively; p = 0.55) after adjusting for morphologic factors. The incidence of TVF at 1 year was similar among the group (RA: 19.0%, OA: 22.2%, IVL: 13.3%, p = 0.81).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing PCI for CN, similar procedural and clinical outcomes can be achieved using RA, OA, or IVL. These findings warrant further investigation in larger, prospective trials.
