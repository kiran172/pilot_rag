Title: Comprehensive endoscopic management of impacted ureteral stones: Literature review and expert opinions.

Abstract: Treatment of urolithiasis, a benign disease, requires high efficacy and safety. Endoscopic treatment of impacted ureteral stones remains a challenging procedure for urologists, despite recent remarkable advances in surgical technology in treatment of urolithiasis. The success rate of endoscopic treatment in patients with impacted stones is reported to be lower than that in patients with nonimpacted stones. Moreover, the presence of stone impaction is associated with high rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications. The best management for patients with impacted ureteral stones should therefore be devised based on the latest knowledge and techniques. The present review focuses on the preoperative prediction of stone impaction, the safest and most effective endoscopic surgical procedures, and the most appropriate management for postoperative ureteral strictures. We overview comprehensive endoscopic management for impacted ureteral stones based on literature review and expert opinions.
