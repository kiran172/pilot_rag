Title: Venous Stasis Ulceration due to Massive Splenomegaly Causing Iliac Vein Compression From Secondary Myelofibrosis.

Abstract: Venous stasis ulcers are nonhealing lesions due to venous hypertension secondary to valvular dysfunction or deep venous outflow obstruction. We describe a case of a 71-year-old male with a history of polycythemia vera, secondary myelofibrosis, and massive splenomegaly up to 38Â cm who presented with chronic, perimalleolar venous stasis ulcers and pain on the left lower extremity. CT showed significant compression of the left common iliac vein due to mass effect from the spleen. He was managed medically while being evaluated for partial splenic artery embolization but expired due to other chronic conditions before any intervention could be performed. Partial splenic artery embolization may be considered as a treatment option for patients with symptomatic iliac vein compression due to massive splenomegaly secondary to myelofibrosis, as long as extramedullary hematopoiesis is not compromised.
