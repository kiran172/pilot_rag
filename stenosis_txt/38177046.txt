Title: Metallic Stents for Hepatic Venous Outflow Obstruction After Living-Donor Liver Transplantation and their Therapeutic Effects.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) is established as a standard therapy for end-stage liver disease; however, vessel reconstruction is more demanding due to the short length and small size of the available structures compared with deceased-donor whole liver transplantation. Interventional radiology (IR) has become the first-line treatment for vascular complications after LDLT. Hepatic venous outflow obstruction (HVOO) is a life-threatening complication after LDLT. The aim of this study of 592 adult-to-adult LDLT cases was to investigate the safety and efficacy of stent implantation for HVOO after LDLT.
METHODS: Records of patients who developed HVOO requiring any treatment were collected with special reference to the metallic stent implantation. There were 232 left-side grafts and 360 right-side grafts. Sixteen cases developed HVOO after LDLT with an incidence rate of 2.7%, 5 with a left liver graft (2%), and 11 with a right-side graft (3%). The IR was attempted for 14 cases; among those, 8 cases were treated by stent implantation.
RESULTS: The technical success rate of the initial stent implantation was 100%. The pressure gradient at the stenotic site significantly improved from 12.2 (range, 10.9-20.4 cm H<sub>2</sub>O) to 3.9 cm H<sub>2</sub>O (range, 1.4-8.2 cm H<sub>2</sub>O; P = .03). The volume of the congested graft liver decreased significantly from 1448 (range, 788-2170 mL) to 1265 mL (range, 748-1665 mL; P = .01), and the serum albumin level improved significantly from 3.3 (range, 1.7-3.7 g/dL) to 3.7 g/dL (range, 2.9-4.1 g/dL; P = .02). No procedure-related complication was noted, and the long-term stent patency was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Metallic stent implantation for stenotic venous anastomosis after LDLT is a safe and effective treatment.
