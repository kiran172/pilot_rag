Title: A Rare Report of Hypoplastic Coronary Arteries and Pulmonary Veins: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Congenital coronary artery anomalies are estimated to affect about 1% of the general population. Hypoplastic coronary artery disease is an uncommon subset associated with significant mortality regardless whether another major cardiac anomaly is present. In this case report, we present an extremely rare case of an infant with hypoplastic coronary artery disease and hypoplastic pulmonary veins. A literature review pertinent to the clinical findings is also contained herein.
