Title: Retrospective Efficacy and Cost-Containment Assessment of 10 kHz Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) in Non-Surgical Refractory Back Pain Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Non-surgical refractory back pain (NSRBP) is persistent, severe back pain that is not considered surgically correctable. Published studies have demonstrated clinically important long-term improvement in pain and functional capacity when 10kHz spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is used to treat NSRBP. This study examines if real-world patients in interventional pain practice obtain the same outcomes, and have any reduction in health care utilization (HCU) following 10kHz SCS implant.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of 105 patients from two clinical sites who underwent implantation of 10kHz SCS for NSRBP. The three most frequent diagnoses were lumbosacral radiculopathy, degenerative disc disease (DDD)/discogenic back pain and foraminal stenosis. The complete set of patient-level electronic data, including clinical outcomes, HCU, and at least 12 months (12M) follow-up were available in 90 subjects.
RESULTS: The 90 analyzed patients were 63.9 years old (median 67) with an average of 10.2 years since back pain diagnosis. Reported pain on the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) decreased from 7.78±1.3 cm to 3.4±2.4 cm at 12M after SCS implant (p<0.001). Opioid usage (n = 65) decreased from 57.9±89.9 mg to 34.3±66.4 mg MSO4 equivalents (p = 0.004) at 12M. There were 46 patients on various doses of anticonvulsants, mostly gabapentin. The average dose decreased from 1847.91±973.6 mg at baseline to 1297.9±1184.6 mg at 12M after implant (p = 0.016). HCU was analyzed comparing the 12M before to the 12M after implant. Number of office visits decreased from 10.83±8.0 per year to 8.86±7.64 (p = 0.036), number of procedures to control chronic pain decreased from 2.2±1.9 to 0.6±1.2 (p<0.001). There was no significant change in number of imaging procedures, hospital admissions, or days spent in the hospital.
CONCLUSION: 10kHz SCS warrants consideration as a therapeutic option for NSRBP patients and appears to provide a substantial reduction in HCU in the year following implant.
