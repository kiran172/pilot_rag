Title: Cerebral regional oxygen saturation as a predictive parameter for preoperative heart failure and delayed hemodynamic recovery in transcutaneous aortic valve implantation: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: This study aimed to investigate the relationship of perioperative cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) with various preoperative clinical variables and hemodynamic changes during transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) under general anesthesia. We retrospectively analyzed cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> values from left-hemisphere measurements obtained using near-infrared spectroscopy (O3â„¢ regional oximetry) at five time points: pre-induction, the start of the procedure, the start of valve deployment, time of lowest cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> value during valve deployment, and the end of the procedure. This study included 91 patients (60 with balloon-expandable valves and 31 with self-expandable valves). The baseline cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> values were correlated with B-type natriuretic peptide, hemoglobin, fractional shortening, ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, STS risk of mortality, and STS morbidity or mortality. The patients who took longer to recover their systolic blood pressure to 90 mmHg after valve deployment with a balloon-expandable valve (group B) had lower cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> values during deployment compared to patients with faster recovery with balloon-expandable valve (group A) and with self-expandable valve (group C). Baseline cerebral rSO<sub>2</sub> is associated with preoperative variables related to cardiac failure and function, and a significant decline during valve deployment may indicate a risk of prolonged hypotension during TAVI.
