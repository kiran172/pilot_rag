Title: Outcome of stenting in central venous obstruction of benign etiology.

Abstract: Background: The aim of this study is to evaluate long term outcome in patients treated for benign superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome by endovascular techniques. Patients and methods: Between 2015 and 2018, 62 patients suffering from central venous obstruction of benign etiology underwent balloon angioplasty with stent placement for venous obstruction in our department. Patency was assessed clinically, using duplex ultrasound in all patients or with CT-phlebography in selected cases. Results: Median age was 60Â years (23-83), forty-one patients (66%) had central venous devices. Swelling of the arm and face were the main symptoms (71%). During the median follow up of 22 months (9-38), cumulative primary patency was 71% after venous stenting. The cumulative assisted primary and the secondary patency were 85% and 92%, respectively. Conclusions: Recanalization and stenting of central vein obstruction has turned out to be the technique of reference and provides satisfactory mid-term patency rates. After adjusting for the risk factors, presence of AV-fistula remained a significant risk factor for recurrent stenosis or loss of patency after intervention.
