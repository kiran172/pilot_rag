Title: Esophagitis, treatment outcomes, and long-term follow-up in children with esophageal atresia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Survival rates in children born with esophageal atresia (EA) with or without tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) have improved; however, morbidity associated with the disease remains high. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), fungal esophagitis, esophageal strictures, and long-term outcomes in children with EA/TEF.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review on patients with EA/TEF who were seen at Children's Wisconsin from January 2003 to January 2023. Patients born with EA/TEF were included if they underwent at least one endoscopy after 1 year of age. GERD was diagnosed based on abnormal findings on endoscopy, pH-metry, and/or history of fundoplication. EoE and fungal esophagitis were diagnosed based on abnormal endoscopy. Esophageal stricture diagnosis was based on findings on endoscopy and/or esophagram, and clinical symptoms necessitating esophageal dilation.
RESULTS: Eighty-five patients (64.7% males, mean age 7.5 years) were included, the majority had type C EA/TEF (90.6%). GERD was diagnosed in 61.1% (n = 52), 49.4% (n = 42) by macro and/or microscopic endoscopic findings, 22.3% (n = 19) by abnormal pH-metry, and 21.1% (n = 18) by the need for fundoplication for refractory reflux and/or esophageal stricture. Risk of GERD increased with lower gestational age (p = 0.0030), lower birth weight (p = 0.023), and long-gap EA (p = 0.034). In children diagnosed with GERD, only 13.4% of patients (n = 7/52) were able to be weaned off proton pump inhibitor (PPI) without disease recurrence. However, overall, at the completion of the study, 44.7% (n = 38) of patients were successfully weaned off PPI without evidence of GERD. EoE was diagnosed in 20% of the patients (n = 17). All patients diagnosed with EoE required escalation of therapy from PPI alone to swallowed corticosteroids in 52.9% (n = 9), dupilumab in 23.5% (n = 4), elemental formula in 17.6% (n = 3), and elemental formula and swallowed steroids in 5.8% (n = 1). Fungal esophagitis was diagnosed in 15.3% of patients (n = 13). An esophageal stricture requiring dilation was diagnosed in 77.6% (n = 66) of patients at a mean age of 28.5 months, with over 60% diagnosed by 24 months of age.
CONCLUSIONS: Children born with EA/TEF continue to be at high risk of developing GERD, EoE, fungal esophagitis, and esophageal stenosis. Diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopy remains a high-yield test to identify and treat these comorbidities.
