Title: The Clinical Features of Late Postoperative Cholangitis After Hepaticojejunostomy Brought on by Conditions other than Cancer Recurrence.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Postoperative cholangitis and anastomotic strictures (AS) are long-term complications of biliary-enteric anastomosis (BEA).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed data of patients who underwent bile duct resection with or without hepatectomy and investigated the risk factors for postoperative cholangitis, benign AS, and incidence of Clavien-Dindo (C-D) <u>&gt;</u>Grade III complications.
RESULTS: Overall, data of 189 patients (115 men and 74 women) were retrospectively analyzed. The median patient age was 73 years. Thirty-five patients (18.5%) developed postoperative cholangitis, and 16 (8.4%) developed postoperative AS. Male sex and serious postoperative complications (C-D ≥ Grade III) were independent risk factors for cholangitis. The incidence of serious postoperative complications was 32.3%. Hypertension, preoperative biliary drainage, C-reactive protein-albumin ratio ≥.22, and bile duct resection with hepatectomy were potential risk factors for serious postoperative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence rates of postoperative cholangitis and AS after BEA were 18.5% and 8.4%, respectively. Male sex and serious postoperative complications (C-D ≥ Grade III) were independent risk factors for postoperative cholangitis.
