Title: Surgical reintervention on the neo-aorta after the Norwood operation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We sought to identify the prevalence of surgical reintervention on the neo-aorta after Norwood procedure and its impact on long-term outcomes.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of all patients who underwent Norwood procedure. The impacts of surgical neoaortic reintervention on outcomes were analysed in each stage of palliation.
RESULTS: A total of 335 patients were included in this study. Thirty patients underwent surgical reintervention on the neo-aorta after Norwood procedure. The timing of initial reintervention was before stage II in 13 patients, at stage II in 7, between stage II and stage III in 5, at stage III in 3 and after stage III in 2. A reintervention before stage II was significantly associated with mortality (HR 14.4, 95% confidence interval 6.00-34.6, P < 0.001). In patients who underwent stage II (n = 251), reintervention had no significant impact on mortality. In patients who underwent stage III (n = 188), the previous reintervention was significantly associated with higher mean pulmonary pressure (P = 0.05) and a higher rate of reduced ventricular function (P = 0.002). Greater than mild atrioventricular valve regurgitation was significantly associated with the development of a neoaortic arch stenosis after stage II (P = 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical reinterventions on the neo-aorta were required in each inter-stage phase. A surgical neoaortic reintervention was not related to increased mortality after stage II but significantly associated with a higher rate of reduced ventricular function and elevated mean pulmonary artery pressure.
