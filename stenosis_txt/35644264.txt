Title: Complexity and Outcome of Reoperations After the Ross Procedure in the Current Era.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Ross procedure has several advantages, but the need for reintervention is inevitable. The aim of this study was to examine the complexity and outcomes of reoperation after the Ross procedure.
METHODS: Retrospective chart review was performed of patients with a prior Ross procedure who underwent reoperation at our institution from September 1991 to January 2021. Demographic, echocardiographic, surgical, and perioperative data were collected. Descriptive statistical and regression analyses were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 105 patients underwent a reoperation at Mayo Clinic after the initial Ross procedure performed at our institution (n = 16; 16.2%) or elsewhere (n = 83; 83.8%). Mean age at the Ross procedure was 27 ± 17 years, and mean age at reoperation at our institution was 37 ± 19 years. Indications for surgical procedure varied, but 64% had autograft regurgitation as 1 of their indications for reoperation. Autograft interventions were performed in 78 patients (74.2%). Pulmonary valve or conduit replacement was performed in 56 patients (53.3%). Double root replacement was performed in 11 patients (10.5%). Aortic reconstruction was performed in 37 patients (38.4%). There were 5 early deaths (5%). During a median follow-up of 6.25 years (3 months-24 years), late deaths occurred in 14 patients (13.1%). Patients with ejection fraction <30% on preoperative echocardiography had shorter duration between the Ross procedure and subsequent reoperation (P = .03).
CONCLUSIONS: Reoperations after the Ross procedure are performed for a wide range of indications, with most due to autograft dysfunction. The number of early deaths is not low. Reoperation after the Ross procedure should be advised before left ventricular systolic dysfunction.
