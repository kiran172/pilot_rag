Title: Extensive Type A Aortic Arterial Dissection Presenting With Stroke Symptoms: A Case Report.

Abstract: Aortic dissection (AD) is a rare but often lethal condition if not properly and urgently treated. Most often, patients arrive with acute hemodynamic instability and ripping chest agony. The patient's life depends critically on a correct diagnosis made as soon as possible. We describe a 60-year-old man who arrived at the emergency room with symptoms of a brain stroke, including poor consciousness, left-sided weakness, and speech disturbance associated with hemodynamic instability, and chest pain. Thoracic aortic arch dissection was observed on CT angiography (CTA). In addition, CTA revealed that the dissection extends proximally into the left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, brachiocephalic trunk, and right common carotid artery and distally to the left common iliac artery, coupled with significant stenosis of the left common iliac artery. Proper management of blood pressure (BP) parameters is life-saving for the patient. Since our hospital did not offer cardiothoracic surgery services, the patient was transferred to a different institution, where he received medical care immediately from an expert team and had surgery.
