Title: Incidence and management of dural tears in full-endoscopic unilateral laminotomies for bilateral lumbar decompression.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report incidence of dural lacerations in lumbar endoscopic unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (LE-ULBD) and to describe patient outcomes following a novel full-endoscopic bimanual durotomy repair.
METHODS: Retrospective review of prospectively collected database including 5.5 years of single surgeon experience with LE-ULBD. Patients with no durotomy were compared with patients who experienced intraoperative durotomy, including demographics, ASA score, prior surgery, number of levels treated, procedure time, hospital length of stay (LOS), visual analogue scale, perioperative complications, revision surgeries, use of analgesics, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).
RESULTS: In total, 13/174 patients (7.5%) undergoing LE-ULBD experienced intraoperative durotomy. No significant differences in demographic, clinical or operative variables were identified between the 2 groups. Sustaining a durotomy increased LOS (p = 0.0019); no differences in perioperative complications or rate of revision surgery were identified. There was no difference in minimally clinically important difference for ODI between groups (65.6% for no durotomy versus 55.6% for durotomy, p = 0.54).
CONCLUSION: In this cohort, sustaining a durotomy increased LOS but, with accompanying intraoperative repair, did not significantly affect rate of complications, revision surgery or functional outcomes. Our method of bimanual endoscopic dural repair provides an effective approach for repair of dural lacerations in interlaminar ULBD cases.
