Title: Robotic Surgery for Pediatric Choledochal Cysts: An American Case Series and Literature Review.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Choledochal cysts are rare congenital biliary cystic dilations. The US incidence rate varies between 5 and 15 cases per 1,000,000 people. In contrast, Asians, which are a large subset of the population of Hawaii, have an incidence of approximately one in every 1000 births. We report our experience with robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical management with biliary reconstruction of choledochal cysts which to date is the largest American case series to be reported.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 2006 to 2021, patients diagnosed with a choledochal cyst(s) at a tertiary children's hospital were retrospectively reviewed. Perioperative analysis was performed. Complications were defined as immediate, early, or late. The data underwent simple descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients underwent choledochal cystectomy and hepaticoduodenostomy. Thirteen underwent a robotic approach while the rest were planned laparoscopic. Eighteen of 19 were female with 15/19 of Asian descent. The ages ranged from 5 mo to 21 y. Presenting diagnoses included jaundice, primary abdominal pain, pancreatitis, and cholangitis. Sixty eight percent had type 1 fusiform cysts while the rest were type 4a. Operative time and length of stay for robotic versus laparoscopic were 321 versus 267 min and 8.2 versus 17.3 d, respectively. For the robotic group, there was one immediate complication due to peritonitis. One-year follow-up revealed two patients requiring endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with dilation/stenting for an anastomotic stricture. There were no anastomotic leaks.
CONCLUSIONS: Robot-assisted laparoscopic choledochal cystectomy with hepaticoduodenostomy is associated with overall good outcomes with the most common long-term complication being anastomotic stenosis.
