Title: Endovascular treatment of an obstructive membrane between inferior vena cava and right atrium in an unrecognized Budd-Chiari syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Budd-Chiari syndrome is defined as a hepatic venous outflow track obstruction of various etiology, which appears at different levels. The inferior vena cava outflow membrane is an unusual, but a potentially treatable cause. The percutaneous treatment has emerged as a very promising management mode for such patients. Follow-up results are favorable for balloon angioplasty and/or stenting, with minimal re-stenosis rates.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a young woman, earlier operated on congenital heart defect and with previous pulmonary embolic incident after childbirth, with no evidence of thrombophilia. She was admitted to our institution for a suspected right atrial tumor. After the diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by membranous inferior vena cava obstruction, a percutaneous treatment of a thick membrane was successfully performed, using an unusual technique.
CONCLUSION: Balloon angioplasty should be considered in cases of membranous obstruction of vena cava, where a focal obstruction is causing the symptoms. In our patient, the anatomy was not suitable for stenting, and balloon dilatation was successful just after the membrane was pulled apart with a big balloon in a "Rashkind-like" procedure.
