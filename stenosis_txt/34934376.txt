Title: Hypercoagulable State Induced Spinal Cord Stroke After Coronavirus Disease 19 Infection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spinal cord stroke after coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) infection is rare, and limited cases have been reported. Spinal cord ischemia after COVID-19 infection is related to increased coagulopathy with thromboembolic consequences. Patients with COVID-19 may have a hypercoagulable state and an increased rate of thromboembolic events, such as occlusion in the spinal artery.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a male case with confirmed COVID-19 infection, aged 60 years, with flaccid paraplegia, hyporeflexia, loss of sensation below the 12th thoracic level, loss of autonomic function, bilateral positive Babinski sign 14 days after the onset of flu-like symptoms, and elevated serum D-dimer and fibrinogen levels. There was stenosis of the spinal artery at the 12th thoracic level in magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography. He showed improvement in motor strength of the lower limb (walking with assistance), numbness and pain, and urine and fecal retention after receiving a subcutaneous anticoagulant.
CONCLUSION: COVID-19 can damage endothelial cells and activate thrombotic pathways, which can lead to clinical thromboembolic complications, such as occlusion in the spinal artery, resulting in spinal cord stroke.
