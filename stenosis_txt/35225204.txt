Title: Absent pulmonary valve with double-outlet left ventricle: a case report.

Abstract: Absent pulmonary valve syndrome and double-outlet left ventricle are rare congenital anomalies, with, to the best of our knowledge, no cases reported to date. We present the treatment course in a patient with an absent pulmonary valve, double-outlet left ventricle, dextrocardia, hypoplastic right ventricle, valvular aortic stenosis, and bronchomalacia.
