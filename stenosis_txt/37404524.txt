Title: Repeated coil embolization of traumatic basilar artery pseudoaneurysm accompanied by bilateral traumatic internal carotid artery stenosis following severe head injury in a pediatric patient: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few cases of pediatric traumatic intracranial aneurysms (pTICAs) in the posterior circulation involving the basilar artery (BA) following severe head trauma have been reported. Here, we describe a pediatric case of traumatic BA pseudoaneurysm accompanied by bilateral traumatic internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis following blunt head trauma.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 16-year-old boy presented to our emergency department after being hit by a car. The patient was initially diagnosed with multiple skull base fractures underlying traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage and left acute epidural hematoma. Seven days following emergency craniectomy, magnetic resonance imaging revealed bilateral ICA stenosis, BA stenosis, and BA pseudoaneurysm. We decided to perform coil embolization, resulting in body filling and a volume embolization ratio of 15.7%. Twenty-eight days after coil embolization, digital subtraction angiography revealed aneurysmal rupture. We performed repeated coil embolization, resulting in body filling and a volume embolization ratio of 20.9%.
CONCLUSION: We reported a pediatric case of traumatic BA pseudoaneurysm accompanied by bilateral traumatic ICA stenosis following a severe head injury treated with repeated coil embolization. Considering the risk of further brain injury due to high incidence of rupture, early vascular survey and appropriate treatment may be the most important prognostic factors in pTICAs.
