Title: Moving towards a uniform diagnosis of coronary artery disease on coronary CTA : Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System 2.0.

Abstract: The Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) is a standardised reporting method which was created in order to improve communication with referring physicians as well as for management considerations. The CAD-RADS score denotes the absence or presence of stenosis, while plaque burden and potential modifiers provide insight into plaque extent and characteristics. The modifier ischaemia enables the incorporation of fractional flow reserve CT and CT perfusion, while the modifier exception is used to denote potential coronary abnormalities. Higher CAD-RADS categories demonstrate incremental prognostic value, with further improvement when taking plaque burden into account. CAD-RADS improves communication with the referring clinician as well as guiding therapeutic management and as such is relevant to uniform patient care in the Netherlands.
