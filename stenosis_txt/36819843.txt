Title: Multimodality Endoscopic Approach for Benign Central Airway Stenosis in Pediatric Tuberculosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: More children are benefitting from the wide application of bronchoscopy as interventional therapy to complications with airway involvement. We present the case of an 11-year-old boy with tracheobronchial tuberculosis complicated by severe obstruction in the left main bronchus. Early interventional endoscopic balloon dilation and cryoablation were adopted as adjunct therapy to his anti-tuberculosis treatment and had shown satisfying treatment outcomes.
