Title: Diagnostic improvements of calcium-removal image reconstruction algorithm using photon-counting detector CT for calcified coronary lesions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of a calcium-removal image reconstruction algorithm with photon-counting detector-computed tomography (PCD-CT), a technology that hides only the calcified plaque from the spectral data in coronary calcified lesions.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 17 patients who underwent PCD-coronary CT angiography (CCTA) with at least one significant coronary stenosis (≥50 %) with calcified plaque by CCTA and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) performed within 60 days of CCTA. A total of 162 segments with calcified plaque were evaluated for subjective image quality using a 4-point scale. Their calcium-removal images were reconstructed from conventional images, and both images were compared with ICA images as the reference standard. The contrast-to noise ratios for both images were calculated.
RESULTS: Conventional and calcium-removal images had a subjective image quality of 2.7 ± 0.5 and 3.2 ± 0.9, respectively (p < 0.001). The percentage of segments with a non-diagnostic image quality was 32.7 % for conventional images and 28.3 % for calcium-removal images (p < 0.001). The segment-based diagnostic accuracy revealed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 for calcium-removal images and 0.79 for conventional images (p = 0.006). Regarding accuracy, the specificity and positive predictive value of calcium-removal images were significantly improved compared with those of conventional images (80.5 % vs. 69.5 %, p = 0.002 and 64.1 % vs. 52.0 %, p < 0.001, respectively). The objective image quality of the mean contrast-to-noise ratio did not differ between the images (13.9 ± 3.6 vs 13.3 ± 3.4, p = 0.356) CONCLUSIONS: Calcium-removal images with PCD-CT can potentially be used to evaluate diagnostic performance for calcified coronary artery lesions.
