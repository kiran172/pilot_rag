Title: A Minimally Invasive Model of Aortic Stenosis in Swine.

Abstract: Large animal models of heart failure play an essential role in the development of new therapeutic interventions due to their size and physiological similarities to humans. Efforts have been dedicated to creating a model of pressure-overload induced heart failure, and ascending aortic banding while still supra-coronary and not a perfect mimic of aortic stenosis in humans, closely resembling the human condition. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate a minimally invasive approach to induce left ventricular pressure overload by placing an aortic band, precisely calibrated with percutaneously introduced high-fidelity pressure sensors. This method represents a refinement of the surgical procedure (3Rs), resulting in homogenous trans-stenotic gradients and reduced intragroup variability. Additionally, it enables swift and uneventful animal recovery, leading to minimal mortality rates. Throughout the study, animals were followed for up to 2 months after surgery, employing transthoracic echocardiography and pressure-volume loop analysis. However, longer follow-up periods can be achieved if desired. This large animal model proves valuable for testing new drugs, particularly those targeting hypertrophy and the structural and functional alterations associated with left ventricular pressure overload.
