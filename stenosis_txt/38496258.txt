Title: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is associated with unfavorable functional outcome after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is calculated in every blood count test and reflects variability in erythrocyte size. High levels mirror dysregulated erythrocyte homeostasis and have been associated with clonal hematopoiesis as well as higher mortality in several conditions.We aimed to determine the impact of preprocedural RDW levels on functional outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: In this single-center retrospective study, we analyzed 176 consecutive patients receiving TAVI between 2017 and 2021. RDW upper limit of normal was < 15 %. Patients were stratified according to preprocedural RDW as having normal or elevated values. We assessed all-cause-mortality and a composite endpoint comprising cardiovascular/ valve-related mortality and cardiovascular, valve-related and heart failure hospitalization at 1 year.
RESULTS: 43 patients (24.4 %) had RDW ≥ 15 %. There were significant baseline differences between groups (Society of Thoracic Surgeons - Predicted Risk of Mortality score 3.18 %[interquartile range 1.87-5.47] vs. 6.63 %[4.12-10.54] p < 0.001; hemoglobin 13.2 g/dL[11.8-14.1] vs. 10.4 g/dL[9.8-12.2], p < 0.001, RDW-normal vs. RDW-high, respectively). Age was not distinct (80.2 years [77.5-84.1] vs 81.2[71.3-84.7], p = 0.78). 1-year-all-cause mortality was not different (7.9 % vs. 9.4 %, p = 0.79). The RDW-high group showed markedly higher NT-proBNP levels after 1 year (647 ng/ml[283-1265] vs. 1893 ng/ml[744-5109], p = 0.005), and experienced more clinical endpoints (hazard ratio 2.57[1.28-5.16] for the composite endpoint, p = 0.006). RDW remained an independent predictor of the composite endpoint when accounting for all baseline differences in multivariable regression.
CONCLUSION: Elevated preprocedural RDW identifies patients at risk for impaired functional outcome after TAVI and may represent a useful low-cost parameter to guide intensity of outpatient surveillance strategies.
