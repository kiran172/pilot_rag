Title: Is Concomitant Mitral Stenosis Associated With Worse Outcomes in Patients Who Underwent TAVR? Insights from a National Database.

Abstract: Concomitant mitral stenosis (MS) is present in 10% to 15% of all patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Our aim is to assess outcomes of TAVR in patients with MS using a national database. The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify patients who underwent TAVR from 2015 to 2020. We created 2 groups, patients with and those without MS. We then compared baseline characteristics, demographics, and in-hospital outcomes of the groups. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, acute respiratory failure, and pacemaker placement. Secondary outcomes were length of stay and in-hospital costs. Our study indicates that patients with MS had greater incidence of acute respiratory failure (8.8% vs 4.89%, p = 0.001), complete heart block (13.54% vs 9.36%, p = 0.01), and permanent pacemaker placement (8.03% vs 6.03%, p = 0.05). In-hospital mortality was greater in the MS group; however, it was not statistically significant (1.32% vs 1.53%, p = 0.679).
