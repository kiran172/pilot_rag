Title: [Postoperative Severe Dysphagia Due to Hypophosphatemia in a Patient with Peritoneal Dissemination of Gastric Cancer].

Abstract: An 83-year-old man presented with melena and weight loss. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed type 3 advanced gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis. Surgical findings revealed numerous peritoneal dissemination, then gastro-jejunum anastomosis was performed. The oral diet was resumed on POD4, however severe dysphagia occurred immediately on POD6. There were no specific findings on MRI/MRA and nasal endoscopy. Serum antibodies related to neuromuscular diseases and connective tissue diseases were also negative. Despite the rehabilitation, the dysphagia remained. Before total parenteral nutrition on POD16, hypophosphatemia was discovered(1.4 mg/dL). His dysphagia disappeared with the improvement in the serum phosphate level. Hypophosphatemia might be caused by an inadequate intake as urine phosphate, serum calcium and serum PTH levels were normal. We present a recent case of severe dysphagia due to hypophosphatemia in a patient with peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer.
