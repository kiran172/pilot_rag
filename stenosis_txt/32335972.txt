Title: Plasma myeloperoxidase levels in acute brain ischaemia and high grade carotid stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is an important oxidative enzyme participating in different stages of cardiovascular disease and predicts prognosis. Little is known about its role in acute cerebrovascular events and carotid plaque vulnerability. In this study, the aim was to assess plasma MPO levels in acute stroke patients and their correlation to stroke severity and stroke outcome.
METHODS: Plasma MPO levels were assessed in patients presenting with acute brain ischaemia within 36 h of symptom onset (n = 144, mean age 64.7 ± 11.6 years, 67% men) and in patients with moderate-to-severe carotid stenosis undergoing carotid artery stenting (n = 51, mean age 66.3 ± 8.4 years, 75% men). Patients presenting with acute brain ischaemia were assessed serially for stroke severity and disability.
RESULTS: Plasma MPO concentrations (ng/ml) were associated with interleukin-6 (r = 0.38, P < 0.0001) and gender (median interquartile range) of 68.6 (49.8-107.0) vs. 59.7 (42.7-85.5) in women vs. men (P = 0.02). In acute brain ischaemia, MPO concentrations were associated with non-lacunar subtype (bottom, middle and top tertiles 37.5%, 71.7% and 71.7% respectively; P = 0.001), with stroke severity (baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score > 10, bottom, middle and top tertiles 6.3%, vs. 41.7% and 31.3%, respectively; P < 0.006) as well as with stroke severity at days 1-2, days 4-5 and at discharge (P < 0.05 for all), but less with disability at discharge (modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 2, 41.7% vs. 60.4% and 58.7% for the bottom, middle and top tertiles, respectively; P = 0.096).
CONCLUSIONS: Amongst patients with acute brain ischaemia, plasma MPO concentrations were associated with stroke severity and non-lacunar subtype, but not with long-term functional disability.
