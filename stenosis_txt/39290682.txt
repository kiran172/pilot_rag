Title: Moderate Aortic Stenosis-Advanced Imaging, Risk Assessment, and Treatment Strategies.

Abstract: Moderate aortic stenosis is increasingly recognized as a disease entity with poor prognosis. Diagnosis of moderate aortic stenosis may be complemented by laboratory tests and advanced imaging techniques focused at detecting signs of cardiac damage such as increase of cardiac enzymes (N-terminal pro-B-type Natriuretic Peptide, troponin), left ventricular remodeling (hypertrophy, reduced left ventricular ejection fraction), or myocardial fibrosis. Therapy should include guideline-directed optimal medical therapy for heart failure. Patients with signs of cardiac damage may benefit from early intervention, which is the focus of several ongoing randomized controlled trials. As yet, no evidence-based therapy exists to halt the progression of aortic valve calcification.
