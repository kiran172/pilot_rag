Title: Pulmonary Vein Intervention for Severe Pulmonary Vein Stenosis After Atrial Fibrillation Ablation　- A Retrospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis (PVS) is a serious complication of atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. The objective of this study was to describe interventional treatments for PVS after AF ablation and long-term outcomes in Japanese patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This multicenter retrospective observational study enrolled 30 patients (26 [87%] male; median age 55 years) with 56 severe PVS lesions from 43 PV interventional procedures. Twenty-seven (90%) patients had symptomatic PVS and 19 (63%) had a history of a single AF ablation. Of the 56 lesions, 41 (73%) were de novo lesions and 15 (27%) were retreated. Thirty-three (59%) lesions were treated with bare metal stents, 14 (25%) were treated with plain balloons, and 9 (16%) were treated with drug-coated balloons. All lesions were successfully treated without any systemic embolic event. Over a median follow-up of 584 days (interquartile range 265-1,165 days), restenosis rates at 1 and 2 years were 35% and 47%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed devices <7 mm in diameter (hazard ratio [HR] 2.52; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-6.0; P=0.040) and totally occluded lesions (HR 3.33; 95% CI 1.21-9.15; P=0.020) were independent risk factors for restenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: All PVS lesions were successfully enlarged by the PV intervention; however, restenosis developed in approximately half the lesions within 2 years.
