Title: Comparative analysis of Bricker versus Wallace ureteroenteric anastomosis and identification of predictors for postoperative ureteroenteric stricture.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Ureteroenteric anastomosis after cystectomy is usually performed using the Bricker or Wallace technique. Deterioration of renal function is the most common long-term complication of urinary diversion (UD). To improve surgical care and optimize long-term renal function, we compared the Bricker and Wallace anastomotic techniques and identified risk factors for ureteroenteric strictures (UES) in patients after cystectomy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective, monocentric analysis of 135 patients who underwent cystectomy with urinary diversion at the University Hospital Essen between January 2015 and June 2019. Pre- and postoperative renal function, relevant comorbidities, prior chemo- or radiotherapy, pathological findings, urinary diversion, postoperative complications, and ureteroenteric strictures (UES) were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of all 135 patients, 69 (51.1%) underwent Bricker anastomosis and 66 (48.9%) Wallace anastomosis. Bricker and Wallace groups included 134 and 132 renal units, respectively. At a median follow-up of 14 (6-58) months, 21 (15.5%) patients and 30 (11.27%) renal units developed UES. We observed 22 (16.6%) affected renal units in Wallace versus 8 (5.9%) in Bricker group (p < 0.001). A bilateral stricture was most common in Wallace group (69.2%) (p < 0.001). Previous chemotherapy and 90-day Clavien-Dindo grade ≥ III complications were independently associated with stricture formation, respectively (OR 9.74, 95% CI 2-46.2, p = 0.004; OR 4.01, 95% CI 1.36-11.82, p = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: The results of this study show no significant difference in ureteroenteric anastomotic techniques with respect to UES development regarding individual patients but suggest a higher risk of bilateral UES formation in patients undergoing Wallace anastomosis. This is reflected in the increased UES rate under consideration of the individual renal units.
