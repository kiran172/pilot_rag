Title: Treatment of Pseudotumor Cerebri (Sinus Stenosis).

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension, pseudotumor cerebri, and benign intracranial hypertension are terms used to describe a neurologic syndrome characterized by elevated intracranial pressure, headache, vision loss, and absence of underlying mass lesion and infection. Increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production has been proposed to play a role in this condition; however, in patients with CSF hypersecretion with known causes such as choroid plexus hyperplasia, patients often develop ventriculomegaly and hydrocephalus. Classically, pseudotumor cerebri is diagnosed as a triad of headache, visual changes, and papilledema. This article discusses the role of medical and surgical management and the expanding role of venous stenting.
