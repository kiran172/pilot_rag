Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Patient Care Improvements; It Takes a Team.

Abstract: Team-based care has been recommended by numerous cardiovascular organizations involving the treatment of valvular heart disease. Utilization of the cardiovascular team (CVT) in valvular programs has been discussed but there is a paucity of data involving team roles, backgrounds, or expectations. This article will describe a single health system and the roles of the CVT involved in the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) program.
