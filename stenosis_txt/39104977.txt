Title: Flavonifractor plautii Bacteremia With Generalized Peritonitis: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Flavonifractor plautii is an obligate anaerobic rod bacterium that is part of the human gut microbiota. We describe a case of bacteremia caused by F. plautii in a mildly immunocompromised patient with acute generalized peritonitis. The patient is an 83-year-old male, with a history of stage III hepatocellular carcinoma 11 months prior, stage I gastric cancer, and cerebral infarction three months prior. He visited the emergency room of our hospital with a chief complaint of right-sided abdominal pain. A partial resection of the colon was performed due to stenosis of the transverse colon. Due to increasing abdominal pain, the patient underwent surgery for acute generalized peritonitis on the 11th postoperative day. F. plautii was detected in blood cultures collected prior to surgery, and the patient was treated with piperacillin/tazobactam 2.25 g four times a day for 11 days. The patient resumed eating and was discharged with no recurrence. This species may also stain gram-negative, and caution should be exercised in reporting results due to the potential impact on initial antimicrobial therapy. Gram staining showed variation in the length of the bacterium, which is considered a characteristic of this species. Appropriate antimicrobial therapy for F. plautii has yet to be established, and further accumulation of cases is needed to understand the resistance mechanism and confirm the effectiveness of different antimicrobials.
