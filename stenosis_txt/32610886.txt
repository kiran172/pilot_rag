Title: Reversible Cardiovocal (Ortner's) Syndrome in Dilated Cardiomyopathy - A Rare Presentation of a Common Disease.

Abstract: Ortners syndrome is a rare cause of recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy due to cardiac causes. After the description of this syndrome by Ortner in patients with mitral stenosis, it was described by many authors in multiple other cardiac conditions. Here we present a case of Ortner's syndrome in Dilated cardiomyopathy,which reverted completely after medical management of DCMP.
