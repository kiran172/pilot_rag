Title: A unique type of fully covered metal stent for the management of post liver transplant biliary anastomotic strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We report our experience of treating anastomotic strictures using a novel type of fully covered metal stent (FCSEMS). This stent, known as the Kaffes Stent, is short-length with an antimigration waist and is easily removable due to long retrieval wires deployed within the duodenum.
METHODS: Sixty-two patients underwent ERCP and Kaffes stent insertion for post-transplant anastomotic strictures following confirmation of a stricture on MRCP. These patients were retrospectively analysed for immediate and long-term stricture resolution, improvement in symptoms and liver function tests (LFTs), stricture recurrence and complication rates.
RESULTS: Of the 56 patients who had their stent removed at the time of analysis, 54 (96%) had immediate stricture resolution and 42 continued to have long-term resolution (mean follow-up period was 548â€‰days). Of the 16 patients with symptoms of biliary obstruction, 13 had resolution of their symptoms. Overall, there was a significant improvement in LFTs after stent removal compared to before stent insertion. Complication rates were 15% with only one patient requiring biliary reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS: The Kaffes stent is effective and safe at resolving post liver transplant biliary anastomotic strictures.
