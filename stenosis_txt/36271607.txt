Title: Congenital esophageal stenosis caused by tracheobronchial remnants: a case report.

Abstract: We describe a case of congenital esophageal stenosis in which the patient underwent ineffective balloon dilatation twice and eventually required surgery. The case was initially misdiagnosed as achalasia. Pathological findings revealed tracheobronchial remnants (TBRs) in the muscular layer of strictured esophageal tissue. Most TBR strictures are located in the middle and lower thirds of the esophagus. Esophagography is the main examination method for esophageal stricture, and the appearance of the "rat tail sign" is a key diagnostic indicator. Endoscopic ultrasonography can reveal hypoechoic cartilaginous structures. The gold standards for TBR treatment include esophageal stricture resection, end-to-end esophageal anastomosis, and the construction of structures to prevent reflux. At present, endoscopic longitudinal resection and transverse anastomosis of the anterior esophageal wall with partial cartilage resection without pyloroplasty are novel and practical TBR procedures. To avoid further complications, patients with congenital esophageal stenosis should be promptly treated surgically if balloon dilatation is ineffective.
