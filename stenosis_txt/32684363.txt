Title: Relationship between fermented dairy consumption, circulating short-chain acylcarnitines and angiographic severity of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Current epidemiologic data suggest beneficial cardiovascular effects of fermented dairy products (FDP). However, the relationship between FDP consumption and angiographic coronary status has not been previously studied. Furthermore, the role of novel metabolomic biomarkers of cardiovascular risk in this context is unclear. We hypothesize that short-chain acylcarnitines (SCA) reflect the link between FDP intake and angiographic extent of stable coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited 1185 patients admitted for suspected CAD [median age 62 years (interquartile range: 54-69); 714 men (60.3%)]. Prior to coronary angiography, each patient completed a validated Food Frequency Questionnaire. In addition, venous blood was collected from each patient for whole blood metabolomic analysis, using targeted mass-spectrometry. CAD was defined by the presence of ≥1 coronary stenosis ≥50%. Patients with CAD (n = 441) reported lower median FDP intake [86.8 g/day (IQR: 53.4-127.6)] than patients without CAD [n = 744; 103.9 g/day (IQR: 62.9-152.7); p < 0.001]. Upon adjustment for relevant confounders, increased circulating SCA, particularly level of acetylcarnitine (C2) associated with both higher CAD probability [SCA:β(SE) = 0.584 (0.235), p = 0.013; C2:β(SE) = 0.575 (0.242), p = 0.017] and decreased FDP consumption [SCA:β/100 g FDP-increment/day (SE) = -0.785 (0.242), p = 0.001; C2:β(SE) = -0.560 (0.230), p = 0.015]. By mediation analysis, neither SCA nor C2 showed relevant mediator effect linking FDP consumption to the risk of CAD.
CONCLUSION: Increased consumption of fermented milk was associated with lower prevalence of CAD and correlated inversely with circulating SCA, in particular with acetylcarnitine. No substantial mediator effect of SCA linking fermented milk intake with risk of CAD was found.
