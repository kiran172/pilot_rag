Title: Continuation of Dual Antiplatelet Therapy in a Patient with a Coronary Artery Stent with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever: A Clinical Conundrum.

Abstract: Severe thrombocytopenia with impairment of the activity of platelets and impairment of blood clotting occurs in dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). Continuation of dual antiplatelet therapy in such patients can result in life-threatening hemorrhages. On the other hand, withholding of antiplatelets in a patient undergone coronary stenting lately can lead to stent thrombosis, resulting in myocardial infarctions and sudden cardiac death. There are no guidelines on management of DHF in patients with coronary stents. Here, we discuss about several divergent factors that need to be considered and balanced when managing such patients. We describe a case as an example to illustrate how we balanced the risk of serious bleeding versus the risk of stent thrombosis successfully according to evolution of the disease process, by temporary withholding of antiplatelets in such a patient.
