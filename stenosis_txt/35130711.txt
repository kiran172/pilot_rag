Title: Five-Year Outcomes After Fractional Flow Reserve-Based Deferral of Revascularization in Chronic Coronary Syndrome: Final Results From the J-CONFIRM Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little large-scale data is available about the long-term (beyond 3 years) clinical outcomes after fractional flow reserve (FFR)-based deferral of revascularization in clinical practice. We sought to assess the 5-year outcomes after deferral of revascularization based on FFR.
METHODS: The J-CONFIRM registry (Long-Term Outcomes of Japanese Patients With Deferral of Coronary Intervention Based on Fractional Flow Reserve in Multicenter Registry) prospectively enrolled 1263 patients with 1447 lesions in whom revascularization was deferred based on FFR from 28 Japanese centers. The primary study end point was the cumulative 5-year incidence of target vessel failure (TVF), including cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, and clinically driven target vessel revascularization.
RESULTS: Five-year follow-up was completed in 92.2% of patients. The 5-year TVF rate was 11.6% in deferred lesions, mainly driven by clinically driven target vessel revascularization (9.8%). Cardiac death and target vessel-related myocardial infarction were 1.9% and 0.95%, respectively. Cumulative 5-year incidence of TVF was similar between the FFR 0.75 to 0.80 and 0.81 to 0.85 groups even after adjustment for baseline characteristics (12.2% versus 13.0%, inverse probability-weighted hazard ratio, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.46-1.60]; P=0.63). Compared with the almost normal FFR (0.86-1.00) group, the significant (&lt;0.75) and borderline (0.75-0.85) FFR groups showed a higher incidence of TVF at 5 years (29.9% versus 12.8% versus 8.6%, P&lt;0.001). Independent predictors of the 5-year TVF were hemodialysis, FFR value, left main coronary artery lesion, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, and male sex.
CONCLUSIONS: The 5-year TVF rate was 11.6% in deferred lesions, mainly driven by clinically driven target vessel revascularization. Notably, cardiac death and target vessel-related myocardial infarction rarely occurred during the follow-up. Our findings highlight the long-term safety of FFR-based deferral of revascularization in patients with chronic coronary syndrome.
