Title: Enteral baclofen withdrawal managed with intravenous dexmedetomidine: A case report.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Acute enteral baclofen withdrawal can be clinically severe if not identified and managed appropriately. Treatment of baclofen withdrawal includes supportive care and reinitiation of baclofen. There are limited pharmacotherapeutic interventions available to manage symptoms of acute enteral baclofen withdrawal, especially in nonintubated patients.
SUMMARY: We describe a 61-year-old Caucasian male with a past medical history of chronic back pain and spinal stenosis who was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with confusion, insomnia, agitation, delirium, and auditory and visual hallucinations. For control of agitation, the patient was administered 10 mg of i.v. haloperidol, 1 mg of i.v. lorazepam, and 14 mg of i.v. midazolam, with minimal improvement noted; therefore, dexmedetomidine was initiated, which led to clinical resolution of his symptoms. Upon further investigation it was determined that the patient was taking approximately 10 baclofen 20-mg tablets a day. According to his pharmacy records, he had filled prescriptions for a total of 738 baclofen tablets in the previous 12 weeks. The patient's presentation and sudden discontinuation of high-dose baclofen led to a diagnosis of baclofen withdrawal. Baclofen was subsequently restarted, and dexmedetomidine was weaned over 36 hours.
CONCLUSION: Dexmedetomidine controlled this patient's agitation and delirium without suppressing his respiratory drive and should be considered for management of acute enteral baclofen withdrawal.
