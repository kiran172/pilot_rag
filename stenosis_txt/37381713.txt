Title: Robotic-assisted double lingual mucosal graft ureteroplasty for multifocal ureteral strictures: Case report and technical description.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ureteroplasty with a single onlay graft for proximal ureter stricture has been widely used in the clinic. However, robotic ureteroplasty with a double lingual mucosal graft (RU-DLMG) has not been reported.
METHODS: The intraoperative measured ureteral stricture lengths of patient 1 were 1.8, 2.5, and 4.6 cm, and those of patient 2 were 2.5 and 3.5 cm. We performed a RU-DLMG in which the diseased ureter was incised longitudinally from the ventral side and repaired with a double lingual mucosal graft to widen the ureteral lumen. Because of the presence of a distal ureter stricture, RU-DLMG combined with ureteral reimplantation was performed in patient 1.
RESULTS: Antegrade urography showed no obstruction of the reconstructed ureteral segment after removing the ureteral stent. The patients had no complaints about the donor site and flank pain during the 12-month follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: RU-DLMG appears to be a suitable option for multifocal ureteral strictures.
