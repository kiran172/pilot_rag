Title: Aortic valve replacement in a patient with self-reported systemic multiple metal allergy.

Abstract: We report our experience with aortic valve replacement in a patient with severe aortic stenosis who had self-reported allergies to multiple metals. The patient was a 74-year-old man. He developed palmoplantar pustulosis after using a dental prosthesis, and a patch test revealed reactions to several metals; therefore, he was diagnosed with systemic metal allergy. His condition progressed to severe aortic stenosis, and bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement was planned. The Avalus valve (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA) was selected for aortic valve replacement, since the patient reported having allergies to several metals. While most devices used in cardiac surgery contain some amount of metal, the Avalus bioprosthetic valve does not contain metal in the stent and has been extremely useful for aortic valve replacement in patients with suspected metal allergies.
