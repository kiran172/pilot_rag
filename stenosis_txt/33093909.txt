Title: Incidence, laboratory diagnosis and predictors of tracheobronchial tuberculosis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis in Chongqing, China.

Abstract: Tracheobronchial tuberculosis (TBTB) is reported in 10-40% of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB). Due to its non-specific presentation, the diagnosis and management are frequently delayed. The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence, predictors and laboratory diagnosis of concomitant TBTB and PTB in Chongqing, China. Bronchoscopy was performed in all patients with newly diagnosed or relapsed PTB in order to detect TBTB between January 2018 and April 2019 in a sub-tertiary hospital in Chongqing, China. The clinical characteristics and laboratory data were analyzed to identify predictors and determine the diagnostic yield of TBTB. A total of 341 (31.4%) of the 1,085 patients with PTB who underwent the bronchoscopic examination presented with concomitant TBTB. The parameters of female sex [odds ratio (OR)=2.57], clinical symptoms (OR=6.26) and atelectasis (OR=4.3) were independent predictors of TBTB. Cough (OR=32.48) and atelectasis (OR=3.14) were independent predictors of TBTB-associated tracheobronchial stenosis. The diagnostic yields of sputum smear, bronchial brush smear, sputum culture, GeneXpert Mycobacterium tuberculosis/rifampicin resistance (GX) using sputum, GX using brushings and in bronchial brush culture used for the diagnosis of TBTB were 44.2, 44.2, 63.5, 57.7, 71.2 and 75%, respectively. GX brushings had higher diagnostic yields compared with sputum or brush smears; however, there was no significant difference between sputum/brushings cultures and GX with sputum. The incidence of TBTB in PTB was 31.4% in Chongqing, China. The parameters of female sex, atelectasis and cough were the major predictors of concomitant TBTB and associated tracheobronchial stenosis. Although GX is an accurate and rapid test to detect TBTB, additional laboratory techniques should also be adopted to improve diagnostic yields in the detection of TBTB in patients with PTB.
