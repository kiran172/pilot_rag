Title: An unusual ureteral dynamic obstruction in a kidney transplant patient.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Ureteral complications are common in kidney transplanted patients; approximately 2.6-15% of patients develop ureteral obstruction/stenosis at some time after surgery, which is one of the most frequent urologic complications. Inguinal herniation of the neoureter is a rare complication but it must be taken into account.
CLINICAL REPORT: We describe the case of a 78-years old male kidney transplanted patient (2004), who was admitted at the emergency room due to abdominal pain and with evidence of acute kidney injury. The ultrasound showed hydronephrosis (grade III) along with ureteral dilatation which ended with an image compatible with a kinking, that was confirmed at the TC and showed that the kneeling was in the right inguinal canal. It was possible, with a manual hernia reduction manoeuvre, to readjust the kneeling of the neoureter resolving the condition temporarily. The patient underwent underwent surgical hernia repair with no complication and complete recovery of renal function.
CONCLUSIONS: When ureter obstruction of the transplanted kidney occurs, it is crucial to resolve the obstruction as soon as possible in order to preserve kidney function. Hernioplastic is an effective way to treat ureter obstruction when it is caused by its herniation.
