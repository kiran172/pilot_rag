Title: Compensation for standing posture by whole-body sagittal alignment in relation to health-related quality of life.

Abstract: AIMS: The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that three grades of sagittal compensation for standing posture (normal, compensated, and decompensated) correlate with health-related quality of life measurements (HRQOL).
METHODS: A total of 50 healthy volunteers (normal), 100 patients with single-level lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis (LDS), and 70 patients with adult to elderly spinal deformity (deformity) were enrolled. Following collection of demographic data and HRQOL measured by the Scoliosis Research Society-22r (SRS-22r), radiological measurement by the biplanar slot-scanning full body stereoradiography (EOS) system was performed simultaneously with force-plate measurements to obtain whole body sagittal alignment parameters. These parameters included the offset between the centre of the acoustic meatus and the gravity line (CAM-GL), saggital vertical axis (SVA), T1 pelvic angle (TPA), McGregor slope, C2-7 lordosis, thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL), pelvic incidence (PI), PI-LL, sacral slope (SS), pelvic tilt (PT), and knee flexion. Whole spine MRI examination was also performed. Cluster analysis of the SRS-22r scores in the pooled data was performed to classify the subjects into three groups according to the HRQOL, and alignment parameters were then compared among the three cluster groups.
RESULTS: On the basis of cluster analysis of the SRS-22r subscores, the pooled subjects were divided into three HRQOL groups as follows: almost normal (mean 4.24 (SD 0.32)), mildly disabled (mean 3.32 (SD 0.24)), and severely disabled (mean 2.31 (SD 0.35)). Except for CAM-GL, all the alignment parameters differed significantly among the cluster groups. The threshold values of key alignment parameters for severe disability were TPA > 30°, C2-7 lordosis > 13°, PI-LL > 30°, PT > 28°, and knee flexion > 8°. Lumbar spinal stenosis was found to be associated with the symptom severity.
CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that the three grades of sagittal compensation in whole body alignment correlate with HRQOL scores. The compensation grades depend on the clinical diagnosis, whole body sagittal alignment, and lumbar spinal stenosis. The threshold values of key alignment parameters may be an indication for treatment. Cite this article: Bone Joint J 2020;102-B(10):1359-1367.
