Title: Outcomes of tunneled cuffed hemodialysis catheters: An experience from a tertiary care center in Karachi, Pakistan.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Tunneled cuffed catheters (TCC) are generally used as a temporary means to provide hemodialysis (HD) until permanent arteriovenous access is established. However, certain complications are associated with use of TCCs such as infections, catheter malfunction/malposition or venous stenosis. Limited data is available on outcomes and long term complications associated with TCCs in our country. The aim of this study was to study the outcomes of TCCs and associated long term complications during the course of its usage.
METHODS: We retrospectively studied case records of patients who had TCCs placed for HD at our institution, from January 2016 to June 2018.
RESULTS: A total of 116 TCCs were placed during the study period. The mean age of the population was 57.09 years; 58.6% were males. The right internal jugular vein (52.6%) was the most common site of TCC insertion followed by the left internal jugular vein (29.3%). Functioning TCCs were successfully removed in almost two-thirds of cases (65.7%) once their permanent access was mature. Development of catheter related blood stream infection (CRBSI) was seen in 22 patients (19.8%) requiring catheter removal in 14 (12.6%) patients. Mechanical complications leading to catheter removal were seen in seven patients (6.3%). The median catheter duration was 62.5 days ranging from 1 to 343 days.
CONCLUSION: TCCs, though associated with complications particularly CRBSI, are a viable option for short- to intermediate-term use for HD till the maturation of permanent arteriovenous access in a limited-resource setting.
