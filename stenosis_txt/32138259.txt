Title: Additional Value of Machine-Learning Computed Tomographic Angiography-Based Fractional Flow Reserve Compared to Standard Computed Tomographic Angiography.

Abstract: Background: Machine-learning-based computed-tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR<sub>ML</sub>) obtains a hemodynamic index in coronary arteries. We examined whether it could reduce the number of invasive coronary angiographies (ICA) showing no obstructive lesions. We further compared CT-FFR<sub>ML</sub>-derived measurements to clinical and CT-derived scores. Methods: We retrospectively selected 88 patients (63 ± 11years, 74% male) with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) who underwent clinically indicated coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) and ICA. cCTA image data were processed with an on-site prototype CT-FFR<sub>ML</sub> software. Results: CT-FFR<sub>ML</sub> revealed an index of &gt;0.80 in coronary vessels of 48 (55%) patients. This finding was corroborated in 45 (94%) patients by ICA, yet three (6%) received revascularization. In patients with an index ≤ 0.80, three (8%) of 40 were identified as false positive. A total of 48 (55%) patients could have been retained from ICA. CT-FFR<sub>ML</sub> (AUC = 0.96, p ≤ 0.0001) demonstrated a higher diagnostic accuracy compared to the pretest probability or CT-derived scores and showed an excellent sensitivity (93%), specificity (94%), positive predictive value (PPV; 93%) and negative predictive value (NPV; 94%). Conclusion: CT-FFR<sub>ML</sub> could be beneficial for clinical practice, as it may identify patients with CAD without hemodynamical significant stenosis, and may thus reduce the rate of ICA without necessity for coronary intervention.
