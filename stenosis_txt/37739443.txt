Title: Delayed approach to postdural puncture headache.

Abstract: A postpartum female in her mid-20s presented with atypical symptoms of postdural puncture headache. However, on initial presentation, the patient reported no headache. Primary symptoms of acute, severe interscapular pain and upper extremity radiculopathy at the time of epidural placement were observed. The absence of a positional headache and the severity of pain at presentation prompted MRI analysis to establish a clinical diagnosis.MRI findings revealed a significant cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak causing a mass effect on the cervicothoracic spinal cord and severe stenosis at the cauda equina. An epidural blood patch (EBP) was considered; however, it was postulated that the narrow epidural space would not be sufficient to accommodate the volume associated with an EBP. She was managed conservatively until subsequent imaging revealed CSF resorption. She received an epidural blood patch on day 7. Thereafter, her symptoms improved, allowing her to nurse her infant and be discharged home.
