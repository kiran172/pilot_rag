Title: Women had favourable reverse left ventricle remodelling after TAVR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Being woman is associated with higher survival rates after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) despite the increase in periprocedural complications. The left ventricle (LV) remodelling process that follows TAVR is considered to play an important role. We aim to investigate whether gender difference affects the process of LV remodelling after TAVR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients (50 men and 50 women) after TAVR were enrolled. Echocardiography was performed at baseline before the TAVR procedure and repeated upon discharge, and at three, nine and 12 months post-TAVR.
RESULTS: Women exhibited an early regression of LV mass and the LV mass index (LVMi) decreased 12.0% from 148.3 ± 48.0 to 130.5 ± 43.7 g/m2 at just a median of 17 days after the procedure (P < .001). Almost one-half of the LVMi regression occurred by 17 days post-TAVR and the LVMi regressed 22.0% by 12 months post-TAVR. In contrast, the regression of LVMi in men seemed to be more gradual and the significant regression of LVMi from baseline began to be observed since three months later after TAVR. The LVMi reduction at nine months was 11.5% and achieved 15.4% over one year. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed only the female sex, better LVEF and greater baseline LVMi were independently associated with greater LVMi regression after TAVR, indicating female gender is an independent predictor for favourable LV remodelling after TAVR.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, female patients with AS had favourable reverse remodelling with greater and earlier LV mass regression post-TAVR compared with the male patients.
