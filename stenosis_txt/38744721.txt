Title: Pigtail with self-retaining bicanalicular intubation combined with Mitomycin C for the treatment of acquired lower punctal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The pigtail was used to create an opening at the lower punctal site in grade 0 stenosis with insertion of self-retaining tube and Mitomycin C (MMC).
METHODS: The patients with acquired lower punctal stenosis (grade 0) were divided randomly into equal groups, Group A: were treated with pigtail and MMC 0.02% and Group B: were treated with pigtail alone. The pigtail was inserted through the upper punctum until its tip reached the occluded punctum, this site was incised with a scalpel (No. 11). A self-retaining bicanalicular tube was then placed.
RESULTS: Results of 36 eyes from 26 patients were included. No differences were observed between both groups regarding epiphora score, FDD test and punctal size preoperatively. The postoperative epiphora score, there were significant differences at 1 month (P = 0.035), 3 months (P = 0.005), and 6 months after removal (P < 0.001). The FDD test, there were significant differences at 6 months (P = 0.045), 1 month (P = 0.021), 3 months (P = 0.012), and 6 months post tube removal (P = 0.005). The punctal size, both groups differed at 1 month (P = 0.045), 3 months (P = 0.03), and 6 months post tube removal (P = 0.005). Only one case (5.5%) at each group showed extrusion of the tube.
CONCLUSION: The pigtail probe, bicanalicular stent and MMC can be an effective method in treatment of severe punctal stenosis.
