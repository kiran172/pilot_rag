Title: Catheter-Based Fetal Cardiac Interventions.

Abstract: Fetal cardiac intervention (FCI) is an emerging and rapidly advancing group of interventions designed to improve outcomes for fetuses with cardiovascular disease. Currently, FCI is comprised of pharmacologic therapies (e.g., trans-placental antiarrhythmics for fetal arrhythmia), open surgical procedures (e.g., surgical resection of pericardial teratoma), and catheter-based procedures (e.g., fetal aortic valvuloplasty for aortic stenosis). This review focuses on the rationale, criteria for inclusion, technical details, and current outcomes of the three most frequently performed catheter-based FCI procedures: (1) aortic valvuloplasty for critical aortic stenosis (AS) associated with evolving hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS), (2) atrial septal intervention for HLHS with severely restrictive or intact atrial septum (R/IAS), and (3) pulmonary valvuloplasty for pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS).
