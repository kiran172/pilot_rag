Title: Impact of Tricuspid Regurgitation Severity and Repair on Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis is one of the most prevalent valve diseases but is rarely accompanied by tricuspid regurgitation. Our objective was to analyze the impact of tricuspid regurgitation severity and its surgical treatment on prognosis of patients undergoing aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study including all patients presenting with aortic stenosis with some degree of tricuspid regurgitation between 2001 and 2018. Patients were grouped according to the degree of tricuspid regurgitation.
RESULTS: From a sample of 8080 patients with aortic stenosis, 143 (1.8%) presented with more than trace tricuspid regurgitation. Among patients with mild, moderate, or severe tricuspid regurgitation, we observed no differences in 30-day (15.1% vs 14.8% vs 8.7%; P = .727), 12-month (51.2% vs 56% vs 55%; P = .892), or 5-year (64% vs 73.3% vs 66.7%; P = .798) survival. Aortic valve replacement plus tricuspid annuloplasty, when compared with aortic valve replacement only was associated with longer intensive care unit stay (9 vs 3 days; P = .043) but not higher 30-day (0% vs 15.5%; P = .112), 12-month (38.5% vs 54.3%; P = .278), or 5-year mortality (57.1% vs 67.1%; P = .594). Only history of liver disease and postoperative major morbidity were independent predictors of survival 30 days, 12 months and 5 years after surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Severity of tricuspid regurgitation in patients with aortic stenosis was not associated with increased mortality. Tricuspid annuloplasty did not improve survival in this subset of patients but was associated with increased postoperative morbidity.
