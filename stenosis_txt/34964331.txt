Title: [Laryngeal cysts in children].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Laryngeal cysts in children are relatively rare, occupying the 4-5th place in the structure of congenital malformations. The paper presents the combined experience of two Russian pediatric otorhinolaryngological clinics traditionally involved in the rehabilitation of patients with congenital and acquired pathology of the larynx.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze the features of the clinic, diagnosis and treatment of laryngeal cysts in children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 68 children with laryngeal cysts aged from 3 days to 16 years (on average 39.5Â±37.0 months, Me=15.5 months). The cyst was localized in the vestibular region of the larynx in 15 (22.1%) patients, in the vocal region - in 15 (22.1%) patients, and in the sub-vocal region - in 38 (55.9%) patients. Data on the presence of a history of tracheal intubation were available in 35 (89.7%) children, including 35 (92.1%) of 38 children with a subfold cyst. 11 patients were admitted with a previously applied tracheostomy.
RESULTS: The main reasons for going to the clinic were signs of laryngeal stenosis (stridor, signs of obstruction of the upper airways) in 60.3% of patients, dysphonia - in 33.8%, and in 5.9%, the detection of a cyst became an accidental finding. To eliminate the cyst, the method of laser marsupialization was used in 10 patients, coagulatory ablation - in 2 patients, in the remaining 56 patients, decortication was performed with microinstruments, followed by laser treatment of the cyst bed. In the follow-up, children were traced from 6 months to 7 years. We did not observe a recurrence of a cyst in any case.
CONCLUSION: Currently, the lining department is the "favorite" localization of the cyst in childhood. Subclavian cysts are more common in preterm infants who need tracheal intubation. A necessary condition for radical elimination is the resection of the cyst walls.
