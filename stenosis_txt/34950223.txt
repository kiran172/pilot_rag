Title: Analysis of Coronary Artery Lesion Degree and Related Risk Factors in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease Based on Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Coronary Angiography.

Abstract: A combination of various risk factors results in the development of coronary heart disease. The earlier that one identifies and deals with reversible risk factors for coronary heart disease, the greater the chance of recovery. The main goal of this research is to learn whether risk variables are associated with greater extent of coronary artery disease in people with coronary heart disease. This article selects 290 patients who had had coronary angiography in our hospital from September 2018 to March 2019 using a retrospective research and analytic methodology. Coronary angiography split the patients into two groups: those with coronary heart disease and those without. To determine the correlation between risk factors and a score related to heart disease, computer-aided statistical analysis of data about the differences in those risk factors was performed. The results were analyzed using the Spearman correlation and partial correlation, and the relationship between risk factors and Gensini score was analyzed by multiple linear regression. For the analysis, binary logistic regression was used to calculate the correlation between the risk factors of coronary heart disease and the probability of developing coronary heart disease. The findings concluded that increased age, smoking, elevated hs-CRP, HbA1c, hypertension, diabetes, and hyperuricemia are all contributors to coronary heart disease. Coronary heart disease is an independent risk factor for this condition. Many of the factors that play a role in the long-term development of the severity of coronary artery disease, such as hypertension, diabetes, smoking, elevated hs-CRP, decreased HDL-C, raised LDL-C, and TG, are commonly found in men. hs-CRP is the primary risk factor for the degree of coronary artery stenosis and could contribute to the progression of the condition by playing a major role in creating more stenosis.
