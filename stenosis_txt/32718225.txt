Title: Cerebral palsy and associated complex congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction and pediatric acute dacryocystitis.

Abstract: Cerebral palsy (CP) is a congenital syndrome with systemic manifestations secondary to a non-progressive lesion of the immature brain. It is associated with numerous cerebral and non-cerebral malformations. The present report describes a 2-year-old baby with spastic CP, diplegic type, associated with congenital cardiac malformations and right eye complex congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (CNLDO) (bony nasolacrimal duct stenosis and buried probe) requiring endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and left eye simple CNLDO which resolved on probing the system. This report also lays emphasis on the need for examination of the lacrimal drainage system in all patients with CP, so as to treat them appropriately and reduce the morbidity.
