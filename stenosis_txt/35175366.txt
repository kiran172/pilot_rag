Title: Agenesis of the right internal carotid artery and aqueductal stenosis in a child with hydrocephalus, the role of endoscopic third ventriculostomy: a case report.

Abstract: Agenesis of the internal carotid artery (aICA) is a rare congenital vascular condition that can affect one or both sides of the patient. Most patients remain asymptomatic, but ischemic/hemorrhagic stroke, intracranial aneurysm, and other neurologic findings can occur. CT scan can demonstrate the absence of the bony carotid canal and helps to differentiate a complete aICA from aplasia or hypoplasia. The association of aICA and aqueductal stenosis (AS) has never been reported in the literature. We report the case of a 9-year-old with agenesis of the right ICA associated with AS and hydrocephalus, which was treated successfully with an endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV). We review the literature looking for the association of the clinical findings and the evolution of the patient.
