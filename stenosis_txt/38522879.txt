Title: Improving Outcomes in Pulmonary Vein Stenosis: Novel Pursuits and Paradigm Shifts.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) remains a clinical challenge, with progressive restenosis being common. In the past five years, we have seen an exponential increase in both clinical and scientific publication related to PVS. Central to progress in PVS clinical care is the paradigm shift towards collaborative, multidisciplinary care that utilizes a multimodality approach to treatment. This manuscript will discuss recent conceptual gains in PVS treatment and research while highlighting important outstanding questions and barriers.
