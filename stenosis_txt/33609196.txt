Title: Screening for ATTR amyloidosis in the clinic: overlapping disorders, misdiagnosis, and multiorgan awareness.

Abstract: Amyloid transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is a clinically heterogeneous and fatal disease that results from deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues, causing progressive loss of function. The objective of this review is to increase awareness and diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis by improving recognition of its overlapping conditions, misdiagnosis, and multiorgan presentation. Cardiac manifestations include heart failure, atrial fibrillation, intolerance to previously prescribed antihypertensives, sinus node dysfunction, and atrioventricular block, resulting in the need for permanent pacing. Neurologic manifestations include progressive sensorimotor neuropathy (e.g., pain, weakness) and autonomic dysfunction (e.g., erectile dysfunction, chronic diarrhea, orthostatic hypotension). Non-cardiac red flags often precede the diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis and include musculoskeletal manifestations (e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, lumbar spinal stenosis, spontaneous rupture of the distal tendon biceps, shoulder and knee surgery). Awareness and recognition of the constellation of symptoms, including cardiac, neurologic, and musculoskeletal manifestations, will help with early diagnosis of ATTR amyloidosis and faster access to therapies, thereby slowing the progression of this debilitating disease.
