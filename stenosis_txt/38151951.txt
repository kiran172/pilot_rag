Title: [Research progress on the identification of central lung cancer and atelectasis using multimodal imaging].

Abstract: Central lung cancer is a common disease in clinic which usually occurs above the segmental bronchus. It is commonly accompanied by bronchial stenosis or obstruction, which can easily lead to atelectasis. Accurately distinguishing lung cancer from atelectasis is important for tumor staging, delineating the radiotherapy target area, and evaluating treatment efficacy. This article reviews domestic and foreign literatures on how to define the boundary between central lung cancer and atelectasis based on multimodal images, aiming to summarize the experiences and propose the prospects.
