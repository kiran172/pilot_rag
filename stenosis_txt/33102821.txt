Title: Successful basilar artery dilatation in pure bilateral cerebral peduncular infarctions using balloon angioplasty.

Abstract: •An extremely rare case of bilateral cerebral peduncular infarctions (BCPI) is reported.•The detection of the pure Mickey Mouse ears sign on MRI is an indicator of a need for reperfusion therapy.•Severe stenosis of the basilar artery (BA) and a poor collateral supply from both posterior cerebral arteries were seen.•Balloon angioplasty for the BA stenosis ameliorated the stenosis and produced a favorable outcome.
