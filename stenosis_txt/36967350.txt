Title: Definition and grading of anastomotic stricture/stenosis following low anastomosis after total mesorectal excision: A single-center study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anastomotic stricture/stenosis (AS) is an alarming complication after colorectal surgery, and there is still no recognized definition for AS. This study aimed to determine the status and change of AS after rectal surgery using a special AS definition and grading system, discuss various risk factors for AS.
METHODS: This study included patients with rectal cancer who underwent total mesorectal excision between May 2014 and May 2021. A five-degree special AS definition and grading system was used to determine AS status, and clinical outcomes and risk factors for AS were investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 473 patients were enrolled in this study. Univariate and multivariate analyses of patient-related and technical risk factors for AS were performed 3 months postoperatively. For univariate analysis, female sex was a lower risk factor for AS. Defunctioning stoma, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, and anastomotic leakage were higher risk factors for AS (all p < 0.05). For multivariate analysis, only neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, and anastomotic leakage were still higher risk factors for AS (all p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Through a special AS definition and grading system's evaluation, we noted that neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, chemotherapy, and anastomotic leakage were the higher risk factors for AS.
