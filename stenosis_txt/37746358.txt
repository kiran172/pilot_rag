Title: Navigating Subclavian Artery Stenosis in Pregnancy: A Multidisciplinary Approach to a High-Risk Case.

Abstract: Given the possibility of serious consequences for both the pregnant woman and the developing baby, subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) during pregnancy represents a unique but demanding scenario that requires quick and thorough treatment. In this report, we present a case of a pregnant patient with SAS who was managed effectively by employing a multidisciplinary approach, with a focus on clinical decision-making and intervention measures to ensure the best possible outcomes for both the mother and the fetus. This case report highlights the significance of prompt recognition and action to avoid the adverse consequences of SAS during pregnancy. To establish uniform standards for managing such high-risk cases and achieve better patient outcomes, more research and case studies are required.
