Title: Long-term clinical outcomes of patients with nonsignificant transplanted renal artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is the main vascular complication of kidney transplantation. For research and treatment purposes, several authors consider critical renal artery stenosis to be greater than 50%, and percutaneous intervention is indicated in this scenario. However, there are no reports in the current literature on the evolution of patients with less than 50% stenosis.
METHOD: This retrospective study included data from all patients who underwent kidney transplantation and were suspected of having TRAS after transplantation with stenosis under 50% independent of age and were referred for angiography at a single centre between January 2007 and December 2014.
RESULTS: During this period, 6,829 kidney transplants were performed at Hospital do Rim, 313 of whom had a clinical suspicion of TRAS, and 54 of whom presented no significant stenosis. The average age was 35.93Â years old, the predominant sex was male, and most individuals (94.4%) underwent dialysis before transplantation. In most cases in this group, transplants occurred from a deceased donor (66.7%). The time between transplantation and angiography was less than one year in 79.6% of patients, and all presented nonsignificant TRAS. Creatinine levels, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate improved over the long term. The outcomes found were death and allograft loss.
CONCLUSION: Age, sex and ethnic group of patients were factors that did not interfere with the frequency of renal artery stenosis. The outcomes showed that in the long term, most patients evolve well and have improved quality of life and kidney function, although there are cases of death and kidney loss.
