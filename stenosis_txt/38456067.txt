Title: Current knowledge for the risk factors of early permanent pacemaker implantation following transcatheter aortic valve replacement and what is next for the primary prevention?

Abstract: In this editorial, we comprehensively summarized the preoperative risk factors of early permanent pacemaker implantation after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) among patients with severe aortic stenosis from several renowned clinical studies and focused on the primary prevention of managing the modifiable factors, e.g., paroxysmal atrial fibrillation before the TAVR.
