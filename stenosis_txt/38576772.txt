Title: Transhepatic Access for Percutaneous Mitral Balloon Commissurotomy With Dextrocardia and Inferior Vena Cava Interruption.

Abstract: We report a successful percutaneous mitral balloon commissurotomy via left transhepatic venous access in a 42-year-old female patient with dextrocardia, situs inversus totalis, and inferior vena cava interruption. fWe also discuss the revisions required for optimal trans-septal approach from the left transhepatic vein.
