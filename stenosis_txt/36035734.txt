Title: Right Mini-Thoracotomy Beating-Heart Mitral Valve Replacement With a SAPIEN 3 Valve for Severe Circumferential Mitral Annular Calcification.

Abstract: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process that can cause mitral valve stenosis. Conventional surgical mitral valve replacement (MVR) for MAC with mitral stenosis can be challenging and associated with significant risk. Open surgical MVR with a transcatheter valve can offer an alternative in select situations. When such a strategy is not feasible, a beating-heart, mini-thoracotomy MVR with a SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve can be considered. The novel teaching point of this case is use of an alternative approach for managing severe mitral stenosis secondary to MAC, when conventional surgical and transcatheter strategies are not safe or possible.
