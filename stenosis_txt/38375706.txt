Title: Triglyceride-glucose index for predicting in-stent restenosis in patients with iliac artery stenosis after percutaneous intervention with stents.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the triglyceride-glucose index (TyG index) for predicting in-stent restenosis in patients with iliac artery stenosis after percutaneous intervention with stents.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Subjects with iliac artery stenosis, who underwent an iliac stent intervention and were followed up for at least 2 years were included in the study. Subjects were grouped according to TyG index (Group A, TyG index ≤8.848; Group B 8.849 ≤TyG index ≤9.382 and Group C TyG index ≥9.383). The subject's baseline characteristics, blood parameters, claudication distance, Transatlantic Intersociety Consensus classification, target lesion localization, stent direction, number of stents that were applied, and stent type were noted. Pre- and 1st and 2nd-year post-procedure Rutherford statuses, ankle-brachial index, and stenosis degree were recorded. To calculate the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV), Group B and Group C were combined and compared with Group A.
RESULTS: In total, 255 subjects were evaluated (female, n=77-30.2%, male, n=178-69.8%). The mean age of the subjects was 66.00±10.00 years (range from 39 to 90 years). The pre-procedure Rutherford measurements were significantly different among the groups (p=0.001). The rates of mild claudication and resting pain in Group A were higher than those in Groups B and C. The rate of moderate claudication in Group C was higher than that in Groups A and B. The rate of severe claudication in Group B was higher than that in Groups A and C. One year after the procedure, there were more asymptomatic cases in Group A than in Groups B and C (p=0.001). The rate of mild claudication in Group C was lower than that in Groups A and B. The rate of moderate claudication in Group C was higher than that in Group A. The rate of severe claudication in Group C was higher than that in Groups A and B. Two years after the procedure, the Rutherford measurements and the rates of mild claudication in Groups A and B were higher than those in Group C. The rate of severe claudication in Group C was higher than that in Groups A and B (p=0.001). One year after the procedure, the computed tomography angiography (CTA) measurements and the rate of full patency in Group A were higher than that in Groups B and C. The rate of 0-50% stenosis in Group B was higher than that in Groups A and C. The rate of 50-70% stenosis in Group C was higher than that in Group A. Two years after the procedure, the CTA measurements and the rates of 70-99% stenosis and 100% occlusion in Group C were higher than those in Groups A and B. The TyG index has high specificity and NPV. However, specificity and PPV levels were found to be quite low.
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index was found to be an easy-to-use marker for predicting in-stent restenosis in patients with iliac artery stenosis after percutaneous intervention with stents.
