Title: Effectiveness of aortic valve replacement in Heyde syndrome: a meta-analysis.

Abstract: AIMS: Heyde syndrome is the co-occurrence of aortic stenosis, acquired von Willebrand syndrome, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Aortic valve replacement has been demonstrated to resolve all three associated disorders. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to obtain best estimates of the effect of aortic valve replacement on acquired von Willebrand syndrome and gastrointestinal bleeding.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A literature search was performed to identify articles on Heyde syndrome and aortic valve replacement up to 25 October 2022. Primary outcomes were the proportion of patients with recovery of acquired von Willebrand syndrome within 24 h (T1), 24-72 h (T2), 3-21 days (T3), and 4 weeks to 2 years (T4) after aortic valve replacement and the proportion of patients with cessation of gastrointestinal bleeding. Pooled proportions and risk ratios were calculated using random-effects models. Thirty-three studies (32 observational studies and one randomized controlled trial) on acquired von Willebrand syndrome (n = 1054), and 11 observational studies on gastrointestinal bleeding (n = 300) were identified. One study reported on both associated disorders (n = 6). The pooled proportion of Heyde patients with acquired von Willebrand syndrome recovery was 86% (95% CI, 79%-91%) at T1, 90% (74%-96%) at T2, 92% (84%-96%) at T3, and 87% (67%-96%) at T4. The pooled proportion of Heyde patients with gastrointestinal bleeding cessation was 73% (62%-81%). Residual aortic valve disease was associated with lower recovery rates of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (RR 0.20; 0.05-0.72; P = 0.014) and gastrointestinal bleeding (RR 0.57; 0.40-0.81; P = 0.002).
CONCLUSION: Aortic valve replacement is associated with rapid recovery of the bleeding diathesis in Heyde syndrome and gastrointestinal bleeding cessation. Residual valve disease compromises clinical benefits.
