Title: Simultaneous Endovascular Aortic Repair Expands Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Eligibility to Patients With Hostile Aortic Pathology.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In recent years, Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has become a primary modality of therapy in moderate-high risk patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis. Although clinicians remain vigilant about screening for both aortic stenosis, many patients still, nevertheless, often present only when they are symptomatic. Unfortunately, when isolated TAVR is performed in the context of hostile aortic pathology, it has been reported that patients suffer from higher rates of complications such as rupture, dissection, or death post-operatively.
OBJECTIVES: To explore the utility of a simultaneous TAVR and endovascular aortic repair in addressing symptomatic aortic stenosis in challenging patients with hostile aortic pathology.
METHODS: Retrospective case series within a tertiary care hospital between May 2017 and December 2023.
RESULTS: A total of 11 patients underwent simultaneous endovascular aortic repair and TAVR. TAVR was performed first in 9/11 (82%) of the procedures while endovascular aortic repair was performed first in 2/11 procedures (18%). The median age was 84 years old (IQR = 77-86 years old). The median LOS was 3 days (IQR = 2-10 days). The median procedure time was 155 minutes (IQR = 111-202 minutes) and the median contrast amount was 100 CC (IQR = 65-139 CC). 2 patients (18%) experienced post-operative complications. Both of these patients required re-intervention. This cohort of patients did not experience any mortality at 30 days related to pertinent complications or adverse MACE events. All patients were transferred to the PACU and ultimately discharged home.
CONCLUSIONS: Extending TAVR eligibility to high-risk patients with hostile aortic pathology through the implementation of simultaneous endovascular aortic repair, performed via the same access site, is an effective strategy for management of symptomatic aortic stenosis in the context of extensive cardiovascular co-morbidities.
