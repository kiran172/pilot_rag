Title: Omentin Is Independently Associated with Stroke Severity and Ipsilateral Carotid Artery Stenosis in Patients with Acute Cerebral Ischemia.

Abstract: Mounting evidence indicates an association between adipokines and inflammation-related atherosclerosis. Here, we sought to investigate the association of vaspin and omentin with clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with acute cerebral ischemia (ACI). Consecutive ACI patients were evaluated within 24 h from symptom-onset. Stroke aetiology was classified using TOAST criteria. Adipokines were assayed using quantikine enzyme immunoassay commercially available kits. Stroke severity was assessed by NIHSS-score, and ipsilateral carotid stenosis (≥50% by NASCET criteria) by ultrasound and CT/MR angiography. Major cerebrovascular events were assessed at three months. We included 135 ACI patients (05 (78%) and 30 (22%) with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, respectively; mean age ± SD: 59 ± 10 years; 68% men; median NIHSS-score: 3 (IQR:1-7)). Omentin was strongly correlated to admission stroke severity (Spearman rho coefficient: +0.303; p &lt; 0.001). Patients with ipsilateral carotid stenosis had higher omentin levels compared to patients without stenosis (13.3 ± 8.9 ng/mL vs. 9.5 ± 5.5 ng/mL, p = 0.014). Increasing omentin levels were independently associated with higher stroke severity (linear regression coefficient = 0.290; 95%CI: 0.063-0.516; p = 0.002) and ipsilateral carotid stenosis (linear regression coefficient = 3.411; 95%CI: 0.194-6.628; p = 0.038). No association of vaspin with clinical characteristics and outcomes was found. Circulating omentin may represent a biomarker for the presence of atherosclerotic plaque, associated with higher stroke severity in ACI patients.
