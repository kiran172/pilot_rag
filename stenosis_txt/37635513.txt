Title: A 24-year-Old Male with Marden-Walker Syndrome and Epilepsy: Case Report.

Abstract: We report a 24-year-old male with blepharophimosis, psychomotor retardation, brachycephaly, microstomia, immobile face, high arched palate, single palmar crease, kyphoscoliosis, talipes equinovarus, inguinal hernia, pyloric stenosis, recurrent infections, bilateral camptodactyly, wide-set eyes, decreased muscle mass, hypotonia, exotropia, and ptosis in the left eye, growth retardation, multiple congenital contractures, and hyporreflexia. Contractures improved with aging, but intellectual disability and blepharophimosis remained. He also presented epilepsy, outbursts of laughter, and predisposition to drug adverse effects (skin lesions with carbamazepine and secondary parkinsonism).
