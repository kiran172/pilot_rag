Title: Adult Presentation of Subaortic Stenosis with Subaortic Membrane Treated with Surgical Removal.

Abstract: Subaortic stenosis (SAS) is a rare heart disease in adults with an unclear etiology and variable clinical presentation. In some cases, SAS appears as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with obstruction due to the accompanying systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. A 46-year-old male with dizziness for several months presented in the outpatient department. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated a slightly hypertrophic left ventricle with normal systolic function without wall-motion abnormalities. Just below the aortic valve, a linear structure protruding from the septum side and the left-ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) side of the mitral valve was confirmed, which was causing a significant pressure gradient (mean and maximum of 91 mmHg and 138 mmHg, respectively). A diagnosis of SAS with subaortic membrane was made, and surgical myomectomy and subaortic membrane removal surgery were performed. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography did not show flow acceleration through the LVOT, nor a significant pressure gradient across the aortic valve. This case report highlights the clinical significance of SAS with subaortic membrane, which can be confused with aortic stenosis of other etiology.
