Title: A case of supra-annular mitral valve replacement using chimney technique for severe mitral stenosis with extensive mitral annular calcification.

Abstract: When patients with extensive mitral annular calcification undergo mitral valve replacement, excessive debridement of calcification may result in fatal complications and may protract operation time. We report a case of supra-annular MVR using "the chimney technique" on a high-risk patient for severe mitral stenosis with extensive mitral annular calcification. This technique is usually used in small infants whose mitral annulus is smaller than the smallest available prosthetic valve. We apply this technique to minimize the debridement of calcification and shorten the operation time. The operation was successfully completed, and the postoperative course has been uneventful. This technique was safely and easily performed, and eliminated the need for aggressive debridement of the calcification. We believe this technique may be a good choice for high-risk patients with mitral annular calcification.
