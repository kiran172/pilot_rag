Title: Robotic and endoscopic trans-oral total laryngectomy, a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: Trans-oral total laryngectomy (TOTL) is a novel minimally invasive approach to narrow-field laryngectomy. The objective of this study was to review published data on robotic and endoscopic-assisted TOTL to examine oncologic, functional, and adverse outcomes. MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched between January 2009 and December 2023. PRISMA guidelines were used for data abstraction independently by two reviewers. Proportional meta-analysis (random effects model) was used for analysis. Main outcomes included oncologic outcomes (margin status, recurrence rate) and surgical complications (fistula, hemorrhage, need for second operation). Eight studies were included (total of 37 patients). Cases included 31 robotic-assisted, 3 endoscopic-assisted, and 3 robotic cases which required conversion to open approach. Most cases were performed for laryngeal SCC (22 patients, 59.5%). Primary closure was achieved in all patients. Negative margins were achieved in 20 of 21 patients with LSCC. Recurrence data was reported in 20 LSCC patients with disease recurrence in 4 patients (20%). Follow-up was described for 15 patients (mean of 3.5 years, range 1.6-5.8 years). Eleven complications occurred including fistula, bleed, and stomal stenosis with a pooled rate of 33.7% (95% CI: 16.4-53.0%, I2 = 0). Six fistulas occurred with a pooled rate of 23.2% (95% CI: 5.8-45.4%, I2 = 0). TOTL is an emerging treatment modality appropriate for select patients requiring TL and offers a minimally invasive approach with less tissue disruption. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to examine its oncologic outcomes and complications. Larger case series with adequate follow-up are needed to better characterize TOTL outcomes.
