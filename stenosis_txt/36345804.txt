Title: [Percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with triple vessel disease and left main stenosis - a retrospective study of quality of care in Uppsala University Hospital].

Abstract: Percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass grafting are two methods for treating patients with extensive coronary artery disease (CAD). Choosing method of treatment is difficult for both physicians and patients. European guidelines recommend multidisciplinary decision-making when choosing which procedure to utilize. The purpose of this local quality improvement study was to examine how patients with extensive CAD, defined as stenosis in the three major coronary arteries or in the main stem of two coronary arteries, were treated in Uppsala University Hospital during 2020. We found that 29 out of 95 patients were treated without previous multidisciplinary discussions, but plausible reasons for this were found in the medical records of 26 out of 29 patients. How these patients should be treated in regards to guidelines, efficient use of resources, and informed consent is a difficult task. We hope to raise a discussion of how these patients are treated in other hospitals.
