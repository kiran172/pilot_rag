Title: Prognostic value of CT-derived fractional flow reserve and fat attenuation index in patients with suspected coronary artery disease: a sex-disaggregated analyses.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are sex differences in many risk factors associated with coronary artery disease (CAD). CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) and fat attenuation index (FAI) have been shown to independently predict cardiovascular events. We aimed to examine the impact of sex on the prognostic value of CT-FFR and FAI in suspected CAD patients, and to examine the incremental prognostic value of FAI over CT-FFR in both sex.
METHODS: A total of 1334 consecutive suspected CAD subjects who underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) were retrospectively collected. We divided the patients into males and females and calculated CT-FFR and FAI data from CCTA images. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to assess the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) stratified by CT-FFR and FAI in both sex. Cox regression models were used to assess the incremental prognostic value of FAI by adding the variable to a model that included CT-FFR and clinical variables.
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 2.08 years, 212 patients had MACE. CT-FFR ≤ 0.80 was significantly associated with MACE in both sex. FAI value of left anterior descending artery (FAI[LAD]) and FAI value of left circumflex (FAI[LCX]) ≥ 70.1 were significantly associated with MACE in females. FAI[LCX] added incremental prognostic value over clinical and CT-FFR variables in females, with hazard ratio (HR) 3.230 (1.982-5.265, P = 0.000), Harrel's C 0.669 (P < 0.001), net reclassification improvement (NRI) 0.161 (0.073-0.260, P < 0.001), and integrated discrimination index (IDI) 0.036 (0.008-0.090, P = 0.010). FAI[LAD] did not enhance risk prediction in females (Harrel's C 0.643, P = 0.054; NRI 0.041, P = 0.189; IDI 0.005, P = 0.259). The decision curve analysis demonstrated that the model including FAI[LCX] resulted in the highest net benefit.
CONCLUSIONS: In suspected CAD patients, the prognostic value of CT-FFR is not significantly biased by sex. The prognostic value of FAI[LAD] and FAI[LCX] were significantly associated with MACE in females, but not males. FAI[LCX], not FAI[LAD], added incremental prognostic value over CT-FFR and might enhance CT-FFR risk stratification in females.
