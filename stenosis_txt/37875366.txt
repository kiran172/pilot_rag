Title: Impact of the transforming growth factor-β pathway on vascular restenosis and its mechanism.

Abstract: As a crucial regulatory molecule in the context of vascular stenosis, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), plays a pivotal role in its initiation and progression. TGF-β, a member of the TGF-β superfamily, can bind to the TGF-β receptor and transduce extracellular to intracellular signals through canonical Smad dependent or noncanonical signaling pathways to regulate cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Restenosis remains one of the most challenging problems in cardiac, cerebral, and peripheral vascular disease worldwide. The mechanisms for occurrence and development of restenosis are diverse and complex. The TGF-β pathway exhibits diversity across various cell types. Hence, clarifying the specific roles of TGF-β within different cell types and its precise impact on vascular stenosis provides strategies for future research in the field of stenosis.
