Title: Waiting for bile duct dilation before repair of bile duct injury: a worthwhile strategy?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) is the gold standard procedure for repairing major bile duct injury (BDI). Dilation status of the BD before repair has not been assessed as a risk factor for anastomotic stricture.
METHOD: This retrospective single-centre study was performed on a population of 87 patients with BDI repaired by HJ between 2007 and 2021. Dilation status was assessed preoperatively, and dilation was defined as the presence of visible peripheral intrahepatic BDs with remaining BD diameter > 8 mm. The short- and long-term outcomes of HJ were assessed according to preoperative dilation status.
RESULTS: Before final repair, the BDs were dilated (dBD) in 56.3% of patients and not dilated (ND) in 43.7%. Patients with ND at the time of repair had more severe BDI injury than those with dBD (94.7% vs. 77.6%, p = 0.026). The rate of preoperative cholangitis was lower in patients with ND than in those with dBD (10.5% vs. 44.9%, p = 0.001). The rate of short-term morbidity after HJ was 33.3% (ND vs. dBD: 38.8% vs. 26.3%, p = 0.32). Long-term anastomotic stricture rate was 5.7% with a mean follow-up period of 61.3 months. There were no differences in long-term biliary complications according to dilation status (ND vs. dBD: 12.2% vs. 10.5%, p = 1).
CONCLUSION: Dilation status of the BD before HJ for BDI seemed to have no impact on short- or long-term outcomes. Both surgical and radiological external biliary drainages after BDI appear to be acceptable options to reduce cholangitis before repair without increasing risk for long-term anastomotic stricture.
