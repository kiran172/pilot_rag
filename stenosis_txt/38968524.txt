Title: Nonsurgical therapy for lumbar spinal stenosis caused by ligamentum flavum hypertrophy: A review.

Abstract: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) can cause a range of cauda equina symptoms, including lower back and leg pain, numbness, and intermittent claudication. This disease affects approximately 103 million people worldwide, particularly the elderly, and can seriously compromise their health and well-being. Ligamentum flavum hypertrophy (LFH) is one of the main contributing factors to this disease. Surgical treatment is currently recommended for LSS caused by LFH. For patients who do not meet the criteria for surgery, symptom relief can be achieved by using oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and epidural steroid injections. Exercise therapy and needle knife can also help to reduce the effects of mechanical stress. However, the effectiveness of these methods varies, and targeting the delay in LF hypertrophy is challenging. Therefore, further research and development of new drugs is necessary to address this issue. Several new drugs, including cyclopamine and N-acetyl-l-cysteine, are currently undergoing testing and may serve as new treatments for LSS caused by LFH.
