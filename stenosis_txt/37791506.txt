Title: Symmetry and asymmetry in atherosclerosis.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis remains the main cause of death worldwide. Most important issues concerning atherosclerosis are hemodynamics and how it affects plaque prevalence and distribution, as well as the symmetry and asymmetry of vasculature and plaques. To present the symmetry in the vascular system an analysis of PubMed and MEDLINE databases was performed. As of February 21, 2023, the results were as follows: for "symmetry" AND "atherosclerosis" there were 47 results; for "symmetry" AND "atherosclerotic lesions" - 20 results; for "symmetry" AND "artery stenosis" - 82 results; for "asymmetry" AND "atherosclerosis" - 87 results. Not without meaning are preventive measures. In the light of the Fourth Industrial Revolution artificial intelligence (AI) solutions help to develop new tools outperforming already existing cardiovascular risk scales. The aim of this paper is to present a current view on symmetry within vasculature and atherosclerosis as well as present a new approach to assess individuals' cardiovascular risk in accordance with precision medicine assumptions. Symmetry and asymmetry within the human vascular system play a crucial role in understanding of arterial diseases, including atherosclerosis. Moreover, it is unavoidable to use AI in cardiovascular risk stratification. Int J Occup Med Environ Health. 2023;36(6):693-703.
