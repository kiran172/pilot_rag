Title: Association of serum elabela levels with carotid artery stenosis in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Aim: Elabela (ELA) is a peptide of the apelinergic system and is known to play a role in endothelial homeostasis and vascular pathobiology. In this study, the relationship between carotid artery stenosis, which is the main culprit, and ELA level in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke was investigated. Materials &amp; methods: Cross-sectional observation included two groups of 40 patients with critical carotid artery stenosis and 40 patients with age-sex matched noncritical carotid artery stenosis. Results: ELA levels were significantly higher in the noncritical stenosis group. ELA had a significantly moderate negative correlation with the carotid score (r = -0.334, p = 0.003), maximal carotid plaque length (r = -0.413, p &lt; 0.001) and degree of stenosis (r = -0.397, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: There is a significant inverse correlation between critical carotid artery disease and ELA level in patients with non-cardioembolic ischemic stroke.
