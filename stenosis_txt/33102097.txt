Title: Multiples deep abscesses: A rare complications of bricker ileal conduit urinary diversion after bilateral stenosis of the uretero-ileal anastomosis.

Abstract: The most common complications of ileal conduit can be linked to bowel function, uretero-ileal anastomosis, complications related to cutaneous stoma itself and infections in general. It is often suspected upon the discovery of obstructive kidney failure. The management of stenosis of the uretero-ileal anastomosis is delicate requiring first, an attempt by endourological maneuvers for the benefit of less morbidity, while raising that a tumor recurrence is possible specially if it's performed in a tumor context. We report an original observation of a bilateral ureteral stenosis of uretero-ileal anastomosis revealed by an obstructive anuria five years after a radical cystectomy.
