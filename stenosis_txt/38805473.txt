Title: [Cervicogenic dysphagia: a case report].

Abstract: The article presents a case of pharyngeal dysphagia and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome caused by degenerative-dystrophic changes in the cervical spine with the formation of large cervical osteophytes at the C3-C6 level. Osteophytes caused deformation of the posterior wall of the hypopharynx and narrowing of its lumen by 20-25% from the level of the arytenoid cartilages to the upper parts of the epiglottis. CT scan also showed the intervertebral disc heights lost, as well as osteophytes at the posterolateral margins of the vertebral bodies (disc osteophyte complex). Osteosclerosis in combination with facet arthrosis caused spinal and foraminal stenosis.
