Title: Endoscopic severity of gastric sleeve stenosis can be quantified using impedance planimetry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastric sleeve stenosis (GSS) is an adverse event following sleeve gastrectomy for which objective tools are needed for diagnosis and treatment. Endoscopic treatment with serial pneumatic balloon dilation may relieve symptoms and prevent the need for conversion to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass. Endoluminal functional impedance planimetry (EndoFLIP) is an endoscopic tool that measures luminal diameter and distensibility indices (DI) and could be used to characterize severity of GSS.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients referred for symptoms suggestive of GSS. Severity was determined at each endoscopy by a bariatric endoscopist blinded to EndoFLIP measurements. Successive pneumatic balloon dilations were performed until symptoms resolved; failure was defined as referral for conversion. EndoFLIP measurements of stenosis diameter and DI were obtained pre- and post-dilation. Primary outcomes were pre- and post-dilation luminal diameter and DI of GSS. Secondary outcomes were endoscopic severity of GSS, patient characteristics, and need for surgical revision.
RESULTS: 26 patients were included; 23 (85%) were female. Mean age was 45.3 (± 9.9) years. Mean number of dilations was 2.4 (± 1.3) and 10 (38%) patients were referred for conversion. Mild, moderate, and severe GSS was found in 10 (38%), 6 (23%), and 10 (38%) patients, respectively. Moderate and severe GSS underwent more dilations (2.5 ± 1.0 and 3.2 ± 1.6) than mild GSS (1.8 ± 0.8) and were more likely to be referred for conversion. Both pre- and post-dilation diameters were significantly larger in mild versus moderate or severe GSS. Additionally, pre- and post-dilation DI at 30 ml were significantly higher for mild compared to moderate and severe GSS.
DISCUSSION: EndoFLIP measurements correlate well with endoscopic assessment of GSS. While more data are needed to determine ideal balloon size and threshold measurements, our results suggest EndoFLIP may help expedite diagnosis and treatment of GSS.
