Title: Primary Two-Layered Closure of the Common Bile Duct Reduces Postoperative Bile Leakage After Laparoscopic Common Bile Duct Exploration.

Abstract: Objective: The effectiveness and feasibility of the primary closure after laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE) have been well demonstrated, however, the incidence of postoperative bile leakage after LCBDE remains high. The current study aimed at investigating whether our new suturing method could reduce the risk of bile leakage after LCBDE. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 81 patients who underwent primary two-layered closure or traditional primary closure of the common bile duct (CBD) after LCBDE, and the related clinical data were compared and analyzed. Results: The primary two-layered closure group had a lower rate of bile leakage compared with the traditional primary closure group (P &lt; .05). There were no significant differences in additional parameters, such as operative time, estimated blood loss, postoperative stay duration, time to drain removal, postoperative pancreatitis, stone recurrence, and overall morbidity. No patients developed bile duct stenosis during the follow-up period. Conclusions: Primary two-layered closure of CBD can reduce the postoperative bile leakage after LCBDE. Moreover, it is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with choledocholithiasis.
