Title: Mini-Open Intercostal Retroperitoneal Approach for Upper Lumbar Spine Lateral Interbody Fusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Conventional oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) approach is possible from the L2/3 to L4/5 levels. However, obstruction of the lower ribs (10th-12th) makes it difficult to maintain disc parallel maneuvers or orthogonal maneuvers. To overcome these limitations, we proposed an intercostal retroperitoneal (ICRP) approach to access the upper lumbar spine. This method does not expose the parietal pleura or require rib resection and employs a small incision.
METHODS: We enrolled patients who underwent a lateral interbody procedure on the upper lumbar spine (L1/2/3). We compared the incidence of endplate injury between conventional OLIF and ICRP approaches. In addition, by measuring the rib line, the difference in endplate injury according to rib location and approach was analyzed. We also analyzed the previous period (2018-2021) and the year 2022, when the ICRP has been actively applied.
RESULTS: A total of 121 patients underwent lateral interbody fusion to the upper lumbar spine (OLIF approach, 99 patients; ICRP approach, 22 patients). Endplate injuries occurred in 34 of 99 (34.3%) and 2 of 22 patients (9.1%) during the conventional and ICRP approaches, respectively (p = 0.037; odds ratio, 5.23). When the rib line was located at the L2/3 disc or L3 body, the endplate injury rate was 52.6% (20 of 38) for the OLIF approach but 15.4% (2 of 13) for the ICRP approach. Since 2022, the proportion of OLIF including L1/2/3 levels has increased 2.9-fold.
CONCLUSION: The ICRP approach is effective in reducing the incidence of endplate injury in patients with a relatively lower rib line, without pleural exposure or rib resection.
