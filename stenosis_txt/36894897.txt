Title: Primary diffuse Rosai-Dorfman disease in central airway: a case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare benign non-langerhans cell histiocytosis, mainly involving lymph nodes and skin. It is even rarer occurring only in central airway of lung and in diffuse form. Central airway RDD is similar to malignant tumor in imaging by radiological method and in bronchoscopy features. It is difficult to differentiate it from primary airway malignant tumor and to diagnose correctively in time.
CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a rare case of 18-year-old male diagnosed with primary diffuse RDD in central airway. Although the features examined by enhanced chest computed tomography, positron emission tomography/computed tomography, diffusion-weighted imaging of enhanced chest MRI and bronchoscopy indicate to be malignant tumor, the patient was definitely confirmed by multiple transbronchial biopsies and immunohistochemistry. After two transbronchial resections, the patient's symptoms of paroxysmal cough, whistle sound and shortness of breath were significantly reduced, as well as the airway stenosis was significantly improved. After 5Â months of follow-up, the patient had no symptoms and the central airway were unobstructed.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary diffuse RDD in central airway is characterized by intratracheal neoplasm, which is usually suspected as malignant tumor according to radiological image and bronchoscopy. Pathology and immunohistochemistry are necessary for definite diagnosis. Transbronchial resection is effective and safe for patients with primary diffuse RDD in central airway.
