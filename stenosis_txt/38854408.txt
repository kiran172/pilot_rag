Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis and concomitant mitral valve regurgitation - 5 years follow-up.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the change in severity of mitral regurgitation (MR) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and its effect on 5-year mortality.
BACKGROUND: There is inconsistency in literature on pre-existing MR influencing long-term survival in patients who undergo TAVR.
METHODS: Patients who underwent TAVR at the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein (USKH) Campus Kiel between March 2009 and February 2018 have been enrolled. Echocardiography determined the degree of MR before and within 7 days after TAVR. Patients were divided into two groups according to their MR at baseline: MR-grade ≤ 2 (non-relevant MR, nr-MR) and baseline MR-grade > 2 (relevant MR, r-MR). Primary endpoint was a composite of MR baseline influence on mortality and MR reduction and its' impact on mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 820 patients (642 nr-MR and 178 in r-MR) were included in this study. Of these, 167 patients showed an improvement in MR-grade. Thereof 106 (63.5 %) referred to r-MR with a significant decrease in mean MR-grade (p < 0.01). Systolic pulmonary artery pressure (sPAP) (p < 0.01) and NT-proBNP (p = 0.03) decreased in patients who had an improvement. There was no significant difference in 5-year mortality for MR at baseline (p = 0.35) or reduction in mortality for r-MR patients with an MR improvement compared to patients with worsening or equal MR status (p = 0.80).
CONCLUSION: In patients undergoing TAVR, 63.5 % of patients with MR-grade ≥ 2 at baseline showed an improvement of grade of MR after TAVR with reduction of their sPAP and NT-proBNP values but there was no significant difference in mortality.
