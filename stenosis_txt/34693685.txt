Title: [A multicenter study on the influence of different kinds of carotidal endarterectomy on the course of resistant arterial hypertension].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the dynamics of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and the results of various types of carotid endarterectomy (CEE) in patients with resistant arterial hypertension (RAH).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 1577 patients with hemodynamically significant stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and RAH for more than 3 years. Patients were enrolled from January 2014 to December 2020. Depending on the implemented revascularization strategy, 5 groups were formed: group 1 (n=289 (18.3%)) with classical CEE with plasty of the reconstruction zone with a patch, group 2 (n=472 (29.9%)) with eversional CEE with cut-off of carotid glomus (CG); group 3 (n=109 (6.9%)) with the formation of a new bifurcation; group 4: (n=117 (7.4%)) with autoarterial reconstruction; group 5: (n=590 (37.4%)) with glomus-saving CEE.
RESULTS: In the postoperative period, no significant differences were obtained in the frequency of deaths (0.34% for group 1; 0.63% for group 2; 0% for groups 3, 4 and 5), myocardial infarction (0.34%, 0.84%, 1.83, 0.85%, 0.33%, respectively); ischemic stroke (0.34%, 1.27%, 0.91%, 0.85%, 0.17%, respectively), hemorrhagic transformation (0%, 0.84%, 0.91%, 0.85%, 0%, respectively). However, according to the frequency of the combined endpoint (death + myocardial infarction + ischemic stroke + hemorrhagic transformation), the lowest rates were observed in the group of classical carotid endarterectomy with plasty of the reconstruction zone with a patch and glomus-sparing CEE (1.03%, 3.6%, 3.67%, 2.56%, 0.5%, respectively). This is due to the absence of cases of labile AH and hypertensive crises among patients of groups 1 and 5, which was ensured by the preservation of carotid glomus (CG). As a result, the number of patients with 2 and 3 degrees of hypertension in these groups decreased statistically significantly. The vast majority of patients after these operations achieved a stable target SBP. In groups 2, 3, and 4, there was a statistically significant increase in the number of patients with 2 and 3 degrees of AH, which is associated with excision of the CG.
CONCLUSION: Classical CEE and glomus-sparing CEE techniques make it possible to achieve a stable target SBP level in patients with RAH as a result of CG preservation. Removal or traumatization of the latter during eversional CEE, the formation of a new bifurcation, autoarterial reconstruction is accompanied by the development of labile hypertension, an increase in the degree of hypertension and a high risk of hemorrhagic transformation in the brain. Thus, the most effective and safe types of CEE in the presence of RAH are classical CEE with plasty of the reconstruction zone with a patch and glomus-sparing CEE.
