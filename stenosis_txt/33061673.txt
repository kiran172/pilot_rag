Title: Magnesium Sulfate Improves Some Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis in Patients Suffering from One or Two Coronary Artery Diseases: A Double-blind Clinical Trial Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Given the beneficial effect of MgSO<sub>4</sub> on the cardiovascular system, this study was designed to investigate the effect of MgSO<sub>4</sub> administration on suppressing some atherosclerotic risk factors in moderate coronary artery disease patients with one or two atherosclerotic vessels.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial study, 64 patients with moderate coronary artery disease (55-69% stenosis) were selected according to angiography findings. Patients were divided into four groups including patients with one or two atherosclerotic vessels treated with MgSO<sub>4</sub> (Mg-treated-VR1, Mg-treated-VR2, respectively), placebo treated patients with one or two atherosclerotic vessels (Control-VR1, Control-VR2, respectively). The patients received either placebo or MgSO<sub>4</sub> supplement capsule containing 300 mg MgSO<sub>4</sub> for six months on a daily basis. ESR, Ca/Mg ratio, urine Mg level, serum Mg, fibrinogen, homocysteine, uric acid, Na, K, Ca, CRP, T3, T4, TSH, BUN, and Cr concentrations were measured at baseline and every three months.
RESULTS: Serum T3, Ca, K, homocysteine, CRP, and Mg concentrations were significantly improved in Mg-treated groups compared to placebo groups.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study showed that despite the slight change in serum magnesium level, oral administration of MgSO<sub>4</sub>for six months could slightly reduce the serum levels of some inflammatory and vascular factors in moderate coronary artery disease patients.
