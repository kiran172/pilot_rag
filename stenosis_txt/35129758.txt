Title: Recommendations in pre-procedural imaging assessment for TAVI intervention: SIC-SIRM position paper part 2 (CT and MR angiography, standard medical reporting, future perspectives).

Abstract: Non-invasive cardiovascular imaging owns a pivotal role in the preoperative assessment of patient candidates for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), providing a wide range of crucial information to select the patients who will benefit the most and have the procedure done safely. This document has been developed by a joined group of experts of the Italian Society of Cardiology and the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology and aims to produce an updated consensus statement about the pre-procedural imaging assessment in candidate patients for TAVI intervention. The writing committee consisted of members and experts of both societies who worked jointly to develop a more integrated approach in the field of cardiac and vascular radiology. Part 2 of the document will cover CT and MR angiography, standard medical reporting, and future perspectives.
