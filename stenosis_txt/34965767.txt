Title: A single-centre, retrospective analysis of mortality over 80 months comparing paclitaxel-coated balloon versus standard balloon angioplasty in the treatment of dysfunctional arteriovenous access.

Abstract: AIM: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a standard treatment for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) stenosis to preserve haemodialysis vascular access, promoting improved dialysis adequacy and better outcomes for those dependent on renal replacement therapy. Drug coated balloons (DCB) may help reduce the rate of neointimal hyperplasia and recurrent stenosis, but their use in femoropopliteal angioplasty has been associated with increased mortality at 2 and 5 year follow-up. This study aims to address the long-term safety of PTA for AVF stenosis with clinical correlation to participant co-morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: All patients undergoing PTA for AVF stenosis at a single centre between 2013 and 2017 were identified and grouped according to the use of DCB versus standard balloon angioplasty. All data was anonymised and correlated to verify independent predictors of mortality.
RESULTS: 481 (400 standard balloon; 81 DCB) procedures were performed in 313 patients (250 standard balloon; 63 DCB). Follow-up at 80 months did not show any difference in mortality (p = 0.546). Multivariate analysis identified time on dialysis (p &lt; 0.001), age (p = 0.001) and Charlson comorbidity index (p = 0.02) as independent predictors of mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, mortality was not associated with the use of DCBs, but was related to established factors of dialysis longevity, age and comorbidity.
