Title: Two salvage techniques using a large dilation balloon: Endoscopic recovery of a migrated biliary metal stent and endoscope passage through a difficult duodenal stricture in combination with a duodenal stent.

Abstract: There have been several reports of endoscopic removal of biliary metal stents using forceps or stent-in-stent techniques. Nishikawa and colleagues describe the endoscopic recovery of a proximally migrated biliary metal stent using a large dilation balloon and endoscope passage through a difficult duodenal stricture in combination with a duodenal stent.
