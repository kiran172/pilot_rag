Title: Mitro-aortic valve-in-valve procedures: Many challenges in little space.

Abstract: Multiple valve replacements are known to carry additional risk of morbidity and mortality in redo context. Currently, a transcatheter-based valve-in-valve approach could be useful in reducing potential serious consequences. On the other hand, this approach poses several technical challenges regarding the device and the procedural aspects. We present the case of a 78-year-old man who presented with symptoms of heart failure due to mitral and aortic bioprosthesis degenerations who was deemed to be at extremely high risk for a conventional redo surgery. A two-step transcatheter-based approach was planned and a transfemoral aortic valve-in-valve procedure was followed by a transapical mitral valve-in-valve implantation with a favorable early and long-term outcome.
