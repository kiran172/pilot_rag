Title: Device profile of the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve in low-risk patients with aortic stenosis: overview of its safety and efficacy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a treatment of reference for patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis, and the balloon-expandable SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra transcatheter heart valve systems are two of the most broadly used worldwide. Lately, TAVR has progressively expanded toward the treatment of low-risk patients.
AREAS COVERED: In this review we aimed to describe the main characteristics of the SAPIEN 3 valve, and to delineate the main clinical findings regarding the safety and efficacy associated with this THV system in low-risk patients undergoing TAVR.
EXPERT OPINION: The approval of THV systems for use in low-risk patients has been a significant step forward in expanding current TAVR indications. Along with procedural refinement and growing operator experience, device iterations implemented in new-generation THV systems have played a vital role in the successful spread of TAVR. The availability of SAPIEN 3 represented an inflection point, as it allows for a predictable positioning and safer navigability while dramatically decreasing the rate of residual paravalvular leakage compared to previous balloon-expandable systems. However, some unresolved issues remain like the relatively high rates of conduction disturbances and the uncertainty about valve performance in the long-term. Future studies are warranted.
