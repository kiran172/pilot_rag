Title: Long-term outcomes of surgical reconstruction for post-tuberculosis tracheobronchial stenosis: a 7-year follow-up in a tuberculosis-endemic region.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical reconstruction is often necessary for severe tracheobronchial stenosis resulting from tuberculosis (TB). However, the long-term efficacy of this approach remains unclear. This study investigated the safety and long-term outcomes of surgery for severe post-TB tracheobronchial stenosis.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 48 patients with severe post-TB tracheobronchial stenosis who underwent surgical reconstruction between 2015 and 2018 in a TB-endemic region. Pre- and postoperative evaluations included Karnofsky performance status, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, spirometry, chest computed tomography (CT) scan, and bronchoscopy. The primary outcome was intervention-requiring restenosis over the long term.
RESULTS: The mean patient age was 30.6Â±9.9 years, with 91.7% females. Airway fibrosis was the predominant lesion (93.8%), affecting the bronchi (93.8%) and trachea (6.2%). All the patients underwent resection and anastomosis, and 56.2% required lobectomy. Postoperative complications occurred in 13 patients (27.1%), with prolonged air leaks being the most prevalent (12.5%). All complications resolved with conservative management. Significant improvements in performance status, dyspnea, and lung function were observed postoperatively and sustained for over 5 years. Within a median follow-up of 69 months, five cases of intervention-requiring restenosis occurred within the first year. The freedom from restenosis rate was 90% from 1 year onwards.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical reconstruction is safe and effective in treating severe post-TB tracheobronchial stenosis. Larger studies are required to validate these findings.
