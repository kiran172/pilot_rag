Title: Dural venous sinus stenting in the treatment of idiopathic intracranial hypertension: A systematic review and critique of literature.

Abstract: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is increased intracranial pressure without a known cause. Dural venous sinus stenting (DVSS) is a relatively new intervention for treatment of IIH refractory to medical therapy and lifestyle modifications. In this review, we outline various hypotheses of IIH pathogenesis and describe the role of venous sinus stenosis and the technical details of DVSS. We also present a summary and critique of the available evidence describing the outcomes of DVSS in IIH and review the evidence-based guidelines for this procedure. We conclude that, although many studies have shown generally favorable outcomes of DVSS in patients with IIH, most have serious limitations, the most common one being paucity of pre- and postprocedure ophthalmological data. Thus, there is not enough available evidence to conclude whether DVSS is an effective procedure for treatment of IIH. We also present the most commonly used indications for DVSS as described in the literature and stress the importance of neuro-ophthalmological assessment before and after the procedure to monitor response and potential complications.
