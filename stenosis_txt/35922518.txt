Title: Histopathological evaluation of a retinoic acid eluting stent in a rabbit iliac artery model.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of innovative retinoic acid (RA) eluting stents with bioabsorbable polymer. Sixty stents divided in ten groups were implanted in the iliac arteries of 30 rabbits. Two polymers ("A", poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) and "B", polylactic acid), and three doses ("Low", "Medium" and "High") of RA (groups: AL, AM, AH, BL, BM, BH) were used on cobalt chromium stents (Rontis Corporation), one group of bare stent (C), one group (D) of Everolimus eluting stent (Xience-Pro, Abbot Vascular), and two groups of Rontis Everolimus eluting stents coated with polymer A (EA) and B (EB). Treated arteries were explanted after 4 weeks, processed by methyl methacrylate resin and evaluated by histopathology. None of the implanted stents was related with thrombus formation or extensive inflammation. Image analysis showed limited differences between groups regarding area stenosis (BH, D and EB groups had the lower values). Group BH had lower intimal mean thickness than AH (105.1 vs 75.3 μm, p = 0.024). Stents eluting RA, a non-cytotoxic drug, were not related with thrombus formation and had an acceptable degree of stenosis 4 weeks post implantation. RA dose and type of polymer may play role in the biocompatibility of the stents.
