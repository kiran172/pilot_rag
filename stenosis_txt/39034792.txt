Title: [Clinical analysis of dual enhanced antiplatelet therapy after cerebrovascular intervention for reducing the risk of cerebral infarction recurrence].

Abstract: To investigate the clinical assessment of dual-enhanced antiplatelet therapy after cerebrovascular intervention to reduce the risk of cerebral infarction recurrence, and to provide a reference for the prevention and treatment of cerebral infarction recurrence risk. 202 patients with cerebral infarction who underwent cerebrovascular intervention in Tianjin Fifth Central Hospital from January 2018 to October 2022 were selected as study subjects. The patients were divided into a treatment group (n=104) based on randomized controlled single-blind method with 61 males and 43 females with a mean age of (62.33±2.57) years old and a control group (n=98) with 56 males and 42 females with a mean age of (62.49±2.36) years old. The control group was given aspirin mono-antiplatelet therapy, and the treatment group was given clopidogrel doublet augmented antiplatelet therapy on the basis of the control group, and both groups continued the treatment for 2 months. Platelet counts, coagulation indexes and inflammatory factors were compared between the two groups before and after treatment, and the America National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score was used to assess the neurological functions of the two groups before and after treatment, and the recurrence of cerebral infarction in the two groups was counted within 6 months after treatment. In addition, the patients in the treatment group were divided into the cerebral infarction recurrence group and the cerebral infarction non-recurrence group according to whether they had cerebral infarction recurrence within 6 months after treatment, and the clinical data of the patients in the treatment group were collected to analyze the influencing factors of the dual-enhancement antiplatelet therapy for the recurrence of cerebral infarction in patients with cerebral infarction after cerebral vascular intervention by multifactorial logistic regression. The results showed that after treatment, patients in the treatment group had an international normalized ratio (INR) of (1.76±0.38), a platelet activation rate of (39.52±4.79)%, a platelet aggregation rate of (48.54±5.21)%, a tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) of (28.37±4.47)ng/L, an interleukin 6 (IL-6) of (24.77±3.52)ng/L, a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) of (7.39±1.53)mg/L and an NIHSS score of (6.11±1.39) were lower than those of the control group (2.32±0.41), (44.81±6.37)%, (51.39±5.58)%, (39.66±4.51) ng/L, (29.25±4.04) ng/L, (9.03±1.78) mg/L and (9.93±1.46) points (all P&lt;0.05). At 6-month follow-up of all patients, cerebral infarction recurred in 16 (15.38%) patients in the treatment group and in 33 (33.67%) patients in the control group (χ2=9.185, P&lt;0.05). Kaplan-Meier results showed a statistically significant difference in the rate of recurrence without cerebral infarction in the treatment group compared with the control group(LogRank χ2=4.595,P&lt;0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that smoking history, cervical vascular plaque, post-treatment NIHSS score, post-treatment stenosis score, post-treatment INR, post-treatment hs-CRP and CYP2C19 gene polymorphism were independent influences on the recurrence of cerebral infarction in cerebral infarction patients with cerebral vascular interventions followed by doublet augmentation of antiplatelet therapy (all P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, dual-enhanced antiplatelet therapy may be an effective measure to reduce the risk of cerebral infarction recurrence after cerebrovascular intervention in patients with cerebral infarction, but it is still influenced by more factors.
