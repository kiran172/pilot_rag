Title: Treatment of pacemaker-induced superior vena cava syndrome by venoplasty with a coronary balloon.

Abstract: Venous thrombosis or stenosis frequently occurs after implanting transvenous pacemaker leads, and it is usually asymptomatic. The reported incidence is 30%-64%. The mandatory treatments are balloon angioplasty, stenting, thrombolytic, mechanical thrombectomy, and venous grafting. We present a case with the special cooperation of an electrophysiologist and a coronary interventionist in Ha Noi Heart Hospital, Vietnam, to treat an implanted pacemaker patient with fracture ventricular lead and superior vena cava syndrome.
