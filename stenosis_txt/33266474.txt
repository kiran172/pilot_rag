Title: Risk and Severity of COVID-19 and ABO Blood Group in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Patients.

Abstract: While cardiovascular disease has been associated with an increased risk of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), no studies have described its clinical course in patients with aortic stenosis who had undergone transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Numerous observational studies have reported an association between the A blood group and an increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our objective was to investigate the frequency and clinical course of COVID-19 in a large sample of patients who had undergone TAVR and to determine the associations of the ABO blood group with disease occurrence and outcomes. Patients who had undergone TAVR between 2010 and 2019 were included in this study and followed-up through the recent COVID-19 outbreak. The occurrence and severity (hospitalization and/or death) of COVID-19 and their associations with the ABO blood group served as the main outcome measures. Of the 1125 patients who had undergone TAVR, 403 (36%) died before 1 January 2020, and 20 (1.8%) were lost to follow-up. The study sample therefore consisted of 702 patients. Of them, we identified 22 cases (3.1%) with COVID-19. Fourteen patients (63.6%) were hospitalized or died of disease. Multivariable analysis identified the A blood group (vs. others) as the only independent predictor of COVID-19 in patients who had undergone TAVR (odds ratio (OR) = 6.32; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.11-18.92; p = 0.001). The A blood group (vs. others; OR = 8.27; 95% CI = 1.83-37.43, p = 0.006) and a history of cancer (OR = 4.99; 95% CI = 1.64-15.27, p = 0.005) were significantly and independently associated with disease severity (hospitalization and/or death). We conclude that patients who have undergone TAVR frequently have a number of cardiovascular comorbidities that may work to increase the risk of COVID-19. The subgroup with the A blood group was especially prone to developing the disease and showed unfavorable outcomes.
