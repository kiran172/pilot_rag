Title: LVIS EVO stent-through-balloon after hydrocoil embolization of intracranial aneurysms: One-year results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To evaluate the durability and safety of complete intracranial aneurysm occlusion at one year using the low-profile braided intracranial LVIS EVO stent.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective, monocentric, observational study of unruptured wide-necked intracranial aneurysms treated with the LVIS EVO stent-through-balloon technique after balloon-assisted hydrocoil embolization. Imaging and clinical data were assessed by two blinded independent neuroradiologists and neurologists, respectively. Primary endpoint was complete angiographic occlusion on day 0 and at 12 months. Secondary endpoints included clinical safety using the modified Rankin scale (mRS), ischemic and hemorrhagic adverse events, parent vessel stenosis > 50% or occlusion and retreatment rate.
RESULTS: 103 aneurysms in 103 patients were included (53 years-old, 77% women). Mean aneurysm size and neck were 7 and 4 mm, respectively. Complete occlusion was 97% initially and 90% at 12 months, with pending follow up in 17.5% patients. Five patients (5%) with partially stented necks were retreated with a second stent in a T-configuration. Two stents failed to open initially and were immediately retrieved. Asymptomatic parent vessel occlusion and severe in-stent stenosis occurred in 1% and 3%, respectively. The 12-month procedure-related permanent neurological deficit and mortality rates (mRS 3-6) were 2% and 1%, respectively. There was one fatal bleeding but no large ischemic complications.
CONCLUSION: Delivering the LVIS EVO stent through a dual lumen balloon after balloon-assisted hydrocoil embolization yields a high and stable rate of complete aneurysm occlusion at one year with a reasonable immediate and delayed complication rate.
