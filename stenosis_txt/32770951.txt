Title: A risk predictor of restenosis after superficial femoral artery stent implantation: relevance of mean platelet volume.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between an increase in the pre- and post-operative mean platelet volume (MPV) and superficial femoral artery in-stent restenosis (ISR) rate.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We recruited patients that underwent superficial femoral artery stenting for lower extremity arteriosclerosis obliterans at our hospital from March 2015 to March 2018. All patients gave venous blood three days before and following implantation. Doppler ultrasound, computed tomography angiography or digital subtraction angiography were used for regular follow-up examination. Logistic regression was used to identify predictors of ISR after superficial femoral artery stenting. We enrolled 173 patients, of which 34 (19.6%) were determined as having ISR for a mean of 8.9 ± 2.7 months (3-12 months). Neutrophil count, neutrophil ratio, lymphocyte ratio and platelet count pre-implantation, and platelet count and MPV after stent implantation, and the pre- and post-operative mean platelet volume difference (MPVD) and mean platelet volume difference ratio (MPVDR) were all statistically different when comparing the ISR and non-restenosis groups (p < 0.05). A positive correlation was found for post-operative MPV and presence of ISR (r = 0.58; P < 0.001). A MPVD not less than 1.5 fL was associated with an odds ratio of 9.17 (95% CI [3.76 to 22.35]; P < 0.001) for presence of ISR. A MPVDR of not less than 17.9% was associated with an odds ratio of 7.68 (95% CI [3.19 to 18.49]; P < 0.001) for occurrence of ISR.
CONCLUSIONS: An increase in pre- and post-operative MPV was correlated with the occurrence of superficial femoral artery ISR.
