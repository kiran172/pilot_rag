Title: Endovascular treatment of type 3 and 4 thoracic central vein obstruction in hemodialysis patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Thoracic central vein (TCV) obstruction (TCVO) in the presence of upper extremity (UE) hemodialysis access can present as superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) and cause vascular access dysfunction and failure. We report the techniques and results of endorevascularization of TCVO in hemodialysis patients, which allowed for long-term functioning vascular access in the UE.
METHODS: From June 2009 to February 2020, 45 hemodialysis patients underwent TCV endorevascularization. The indications for surgery were TCVO or SVCS that threatened the function of a preexisting upper arm access or contraindicated placement of a new upper arm access. Conventional endovascular techniques were used when feasible. Patients with unfavorable anatomy were treated using a transseptal needle to cross difficult intrathoracic stenosis and occlusions or to facilitate an inside-out central venous access technique. The reestablishment of venous outflow was accomplished with angioplasty, stenting, and/or placement of HeRO conduits. Successful revascularization was followed by hemodialysis access revision or a new UE access placement. We recorded the risk factors and procedural outcomes, patency rates, complications, and mortality.
RESULTS: The mean age was 53 ± 16.3 years, and 51% were women. The most common risk factors were diabetes mellitus (64.2%) and hypertension (56%). Twenty-five patients (55.5%) had symptoms of SVCS. These symptoms resolved after the TCV procedure in all cases. Crossing of the TCV lesion was successful using a conventional catheter and wire in 26 cases (57.8%) and transseptal needle in 17 cases (37.8%), including 12 using an inside-out central venous access technique. Treatment of the TCV lesion included a HeRO conduit in 20 cases (44.4%), stenting in 17 (37.7%), and transluminal balloon angioplasty alone in 7 (15.5%). Other veins were treated in 33 cases (73.3%). The overall technical success rate was 95.5%. Two intraoperative complications occurred, including one case of severe hypotension and one of fatal cardiac tamponade. Of the 16 patients with preexisting UE access, its function was preserved in all 16 (100%). In 24 of 27 patients (85.7%), new arm access was successfully created after the TCV procedure. The overall clinical success rate was 88.9%. The average follow-up was 663.4 days (median, 507 days; range, 0-2679 days). During follow-up, 26 patients had undergone 90 procedures to maintain access function, 21 had undergone repeat endovascular interventions, and 17 had undergone open procedures. Eight patients (17.8%) had developed infection, five involving HeRO conduits that required excision with loss of access. During the follow-up period, 14 patients (31%) had died of unrelated causes, and 34 patients (75.5%) maintained functional access.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study have shown that endorevascularization of TCVO reconstruction is effective in maintaining function or allowing the creation of UE hemodialysis access, with acceptable complication rates.
