Title: Safety and efficacy of cerebral embolic protection devices in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a meta-analysis of in-hospital outcomes.

Abstract: The evidence regarding the impact of cerebral embolic protection devices (EPDs) on outcomes following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is limited. The objective of this study was to evaluate in-hospital outcomes with the use of cerebral EPDs in TAVR. We performed a comprehensive EMBASE and PUBMED search to investigate randomized control studies or propensity score-matched retrospective studies which assessed patients undergoing TAVR with or without EPD up to April 2021. Endpoints of interest were in-hospital mortality, stroke, acute kidney injury, pacemaker implantation, major bleeding, vascular complication, length of stay. Ten studies involving 173,002 patients with EPD (n = 16,898, 9.8%) and those without (n = 156,104, 90.2%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The use of EPD was associated with significantly lower risk of in-hospital stroke (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 0.64 [0.46; 0.89]), but similar rate of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio [95% confidential interval]: 0.75 [0.54; 1.05]). No differences were observed in acute kidney injury, pacemaker implantation, major bleeding, vascular complication, length of stay. EPD during TAVR was associated with lower in-hospital stroke but did not affect procedural complications and length of stay.
