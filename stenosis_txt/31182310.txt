Title: Arterial ischemic stroke in non-neonate children: Diagnostic and therapeutic specificities.

Abstract: Pediatric arterial ischemic stroke (AIS) is a severe condition, with long-lasting devastating consequences on motor and cognitive abilities, academic and social inclusion, and global life projects. Awareness about initial symptoms, implementation of pediatric stroke code protocols using MRI first and only and adapted management in the acute phase, individually tailored recanalization treatment strategies, and multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs with specific goal-centered actions are the key elements to improve pediatric AIS management and outcomes. The main cause of pediatric AIS is focal cerebral arteriopathy, a condition with unilateral focal stenosis and time-limited course requiring specific management. Sickle cell disease and moyamoya angiopathy patients need adapted screening and therapeutics.
