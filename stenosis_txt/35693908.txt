Title: Innovative Guide Extension Catheter Trapping Technique to Retrieve a Lost Stent From a Coronary Artery.

Abstract: A stent that was being implanted in the left circumflex artery, to treat an iatrogenic dissection, became dislodged at the ostial left circumflex artery on a previously deployed stent implanted for the treatment of a distal left main bifurcation stenosis. We describe here a novel technique to retrieve the device safely. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
