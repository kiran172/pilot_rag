Title: Effect of Mitral Regurgitation on Systemic Coagulation Activity in Rheumatic Heart Disease as Assessed by D-dimer Levels.

Abstract: Introduction Atrial fibrillation and mitral stenosis, especially in combination, increase the risk of left atrial thrombus formation and systemic embolization. However, whether severe mitral regurgitation (MR) improves systemic hypercoagulable state in these patients is unclear. remains unclear. The study aims to study the impact of severe MR on systemic coagulation by the use of D-dimer levels. Methods It was a prospective, cross-sectional study done on 400 subjects consisting of 350 cases and 50 controls. The cases were divided into seven groups on basis of valvular pathology, rhythm, and presence of a clot. The D-dimer level was compared in all the subgroups. Result The mean age of the study population was 32.32±7.30 years with a 48% male population. The highest level of D-dimer was found in patients with thrombus (1.71 ± 1.74 µg/ml). Patients with mitral stenosis had significantly higher plasma D-dimer levels than the control group (p <0.001) while regardless of rhythm, patients with MR had a D-dimer level similar to the control group in sinus rhythm. Conclusion Severe MR reduces plasma D-dimer levels to control levels reflecting the protective effect against thrombus formation and systemic embolization.
