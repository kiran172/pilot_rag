Title: Perioperative Stroke.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review overviews perioperative stroke as it pertains to specific surgical procedures.
RECENT FINDINGS: As awareness of perioperative stroke increases, so does the opportunity to potentially improve outcomes for these patients by early stroke recognition and intervention. Perioperative stroke is defined to be any stroke that occurs within 30Â days of the initial surgical procedure. The incidence of perioperative stroke varies and is dependent on the specific type of surgery performed. This chapter overviews the risks, mechanisms, and acute evaluation and management of perioperative stroke in four surgical populations: cardiac surgery, carotid endarterectomy, neurosurgery, and non-cardiac/non-carotid/non-neurological surgeries.
