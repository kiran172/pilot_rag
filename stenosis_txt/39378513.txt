Title: Does the Combined Arteritis Damage Score (CARDS) in the Diagnosis of Takayasu Arteritis Predict Prognosis and Need for Biologic Therapy?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to investigate the prognostic value of the combined arteritis damage score (CARDS) in Takayasu arteritis (TAK) patients to predict the need for biologic treatment at diagnosis and the possible contribution of wall thickness (WT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blind evaluation of MRA/CTA at the time of diagnosis was performed by a reader rheumatologist (RR) and an interventional radiologist (RIR). The CARDS damage score for 21 arterial regions was assessed as normal, mild or moderate/severe stenosis, occclusion or aneursym/dilatation. Additionally, WT was scored for all regions as present or absent. A modified CARDS (mCARDS) was calculated as the sum of CARDS and the number of WT areas.
RESULTS: According to follow-up treatment, 10 patients with non-biologic treatment (non-BT) (F/M:8/2, median age 37.5 years) and 15 patients with biologic treatment (BT) (F/M:13/2, median age 30 years) were included. Indian Takatasu Arteritis Score (ITAS), CRP, and ESR levels were similar in both groups. CARDS (1.4 (0-7.2) vs 4.5 (.6-19), P: .003), WT (1.5 (0-8) vs 7 (1-21), P &lt; .001), and mCARDS (4 (0-14.2) vs 11.4 (1.6-40), P &lt; .001) scores were significantly higher in the BT group compared to nonBT group. Cohen's kappa coefficient between RR and RIR for WT was .99 with 99.6% aggrement, and CARDS was .98 with 99.6% agreement. The AUC values for CARDS, WT, and mCARDS scores were .748 (.605-.892), .837 (.723-.950), and .847 (.735-.958), respectively, and P value was &lt;.0001.
CONCLUSIONS: The prediction of prognosis and biologic treatment need at TAK diagnosis using non-invasive angiographic images can improve outcomes and prompt closer follow-up. The combination of CARDS and WT as mCARDS achieved the highest sensitivity and specificity, and all scores appear useful for predicting prognosis.
