Title: A rare case of follicular dendritic sarcoma of the vagina.

Abstract: Follicular dendritic sarcoma of the vagina is an exceptionally rare malignancy. Here, we present a reproductive-aged female with no pertinent past medical history who initially presented with a protruding vaginal mass. Pathology from initial excision was consistent with follicular dendritic sarcoma of the vagina. This was ultimately treated with wide radical resection of the mass leading to iatrogenic vaginal stenosis.
