Title: Construction and validation of a scale for assessing arteriovenous fistulas.

Abstract: AIM: This methodological study was conducted to develop a reliable instrument for the assessment of the arteriovenous fistula in patients under hemodialysis therapy. The purpose of the scale is to evaluate risk of developing arteriovenous fistula complications in patients receiving hemodialysis treatment.
METHODS: An item pool was created in accordance with data obtained from our literature review and expert opinions. Validity of the scale was evaluated using construct and content validity analyses. Cronbach's alpha coefficient, test-retest, and split-half reliability were used to assess reliability.
RESULTS: The final 3-point Likert-type Arteriovenous Fistula Assessment Scale developed in this study consists of 18 items in three subdimensions: arteriovenous fistula flow, stenosis and ischemia, and needle entry site. The scale-level Content Validity Ratio was 0.90. Explanatory factor analysis revealed a three-factor structure with factor loadings of 0.622-0.800, 0.361-0.891, and 0.431-0.954, respectively, explaining 55.51% of the total variance. The Cronbach's alpha values for the subdimensions were 0.72, 0.71, and 0.83, respectively, and 0.82 for the scale overall.
CONCLUSION: The Arteriovenous Fistula Assessment Scale is a valid and reliable instrument that can be used to monitor arteriovenous fistulas in hemodialysis patients.
