Title: Delayed Aortic Dissection after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) offers functional improvement for high-risk patients with aortic stenosis. Vascular complications after TAVI are known to occur frequently. Among them, aortic dissection is a rare but life-threatening vascular complication. We present a case of delayed aortic dissection following a successful TAVI.
