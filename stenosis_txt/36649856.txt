Title: Chronic Hydrocephalus and Tethered Cord Masquerading as Postconcussive Syndrome.

Abstract: We present a rare case of chronic hydrocephalus and tethered cord syndrome in a high-functioning asymptomatic college student. Her presentation was triggered by a fall, at which time, she developed subacute symptoms consistent with progressive increased intracranial pressure. After endoscopic third ventriculostomy for hydrocephalus, the patient presented with progressive bilateral lower extremity and sphincter symptoms, leading to spinal imaging and diagnosis of tethered cord syndrome with fatty filum. The patient was treated with tethered cord release and had a favorable long-term outcome. This case highlights the innocuous onset of 2 congenital diagnoses in adulthood seemingly associated with a mild traumatic injury. Furthermore, it shows classic imaging findings associated with chronic increased intracranial pressure, aqueductal stenosis, and tethered cord syndrome (preoperative and postoperative appearances), which serve an important educational role given the relate rarity of these coexisting diseases in adults.
