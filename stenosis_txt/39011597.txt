Title: Retrospective evaluation of three types of expanded polytetrafluoroethylene grafts for upper limb vascular access.

Abstract: Currently, three expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) prosthetic graft types are most commonly used for patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who require long-term vascular access for hemodialysis. However, studies comparing the three ePTFE grafts are limited. This study compared the clinical efficacy and postoperative complications of three ePTFE prosthetic graft types used for upper limb arteriovenous graft (AVG) surgery among patients with ESKD. Patients with ESKD requiring upper limb AVG surgery admitted to our center between January 2016 and September 2019 were enrolled. Overall, 282 patients who completed the 2-year follow-up were included and classified into the following three groups according to the ePTFE graft type: the GPVG group with the PROPATEN® graft, the GAVG group with the straight-type GORE® ACUSEAL, and the BVVG group with the VENAFLO® II. The patency rate and incidence of access-related complications were analyzed and compared between groups. The patients were followed up postoperatively, and data were collected at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months postoperatively. Respective to these follow-up time points, in the GPVG group, the primary patency rates were 74.29%, 65.71%, 51.43%, and 42.86%; the assisted primary patency rates were 85.71%, 74.29%, 60.00%, and 48.57%; and the secondary patency rates were 85.71%, 80.00%, 71.43%, and 60.00%. In the GAVG group, the primary patency rates were 73.03%, 53.93%, 59.42%, and 38.20%; the assisted primary patency rates were 83.15%, 68.54%, 59.55%, and 53.93%; and the secondary patency rates were 85.39%, 77.53%, 68.54%, and 62.92%, respectively. In the BVVG group, the primary patency rates were 67.24%, 53.45%, 41.38%, and 29.31%; the assisted primary patency rates were 84.48%, 67.24%, 55.17%, and 44.83%; and the secondary patency rates were 86.21%, 81.03%, 68.97%, and 60.34%, respectively. The differences in patency rates across the three grafts were not statistically significant. Overall, 18, 4, and 12 patients in the GPVG, GAVG, and BVVG groups, respectively, experienced seroma. Among the three grafts, GORE® ACUSEAL had the shortest anastomosis hemostatic time. The first cannulation times for the three grafts were GPVG at 16 (±8.2), GAVG at 4 (±4.9), and BVVG at 18 (±12.7) days. No significant difference was found in the postoperative swelling rate between the GPVG group and the other two groups. Furthermore, no statistically significant differences were found across the three graft types regarding postoperative vascular access stenosis and thrombosis, ischemic steal syndrome, pseudoaneurysm, or infection. In conclusion, no statistically significant differences in the postoperative primary, assisted primary, or secondary graft patency rates were observed among the three groups. A shorter anastomosis hemostatic time, first cannulation time, and seroma occurrence were observed with the ACUSEAL® graft than with its counterparts. The incidence of upper extremity swelling postoperatively was greater with the PROPATEN® graft than with the other grafts. No statistically significant differences were observed among the three grafts regarding the remaining complications.
