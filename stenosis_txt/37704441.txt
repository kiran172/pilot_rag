Title: High-Sensitivity C-reactive Protein and Intracranial Arterial Stenosis Predicted Recurrent Stroke and Dependence or Death in Minor Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack.

Abstract: AIMS: Inflammation is associated with vascular events. We aimed to investigate the relationship between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels with and without intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS) and the prognosis of patients with minor stroke or transient ischemic attack.
METHODS: We used data from the Clopidogrel in High-Risk Patients with Acute Nondisabling Cerebrovascular Events trial (derivation cohort) and the Third China National Stroke Registry (validation cohort). Patients were divided into four groups according to the dichotomy of hsCRP level and ICAS status. The primary outcome was new ischemic stroke within 90 days, and the secondary outcome was dependence or death (Modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6) at 90 days. The associations between hsCRP level with and without ICAS and risk of outcomes were analyzed using multivariate Cox regression and logistic regression models.
RESULTS: In the derivation cohort, compared with patients with nonelevated hsCRP levels and no ICAS, those with both elevated hsCRP levels and ICAS had increased risk of recurrent stroke (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 2.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-5.34; p=0.008) and dependence or death (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 7.58; 95% CI, 1.30-44.13; p=0.02). Consistent relationships of elevated hsCRP levels and presence of ICAS with recurrent stroke (adjusted HR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.13-2.45; p=0.009) and dependence or death (adjusted OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.23-2.84; p=0.003) were observed in the validation cohort.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant presence of increased hsCRP levels and ICAS was associated with increased risk of stroke recurrence and dependence or death in patients with minor ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack.
