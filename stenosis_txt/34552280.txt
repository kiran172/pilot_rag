Title: Feasibility of patency capsule and colon capsule endoscopy in patients with suspected gastrointestinal stenosis: a prospective study.

Abstract: Patency capsule (PC) can evaluate the patency of gastrointestinal (GI) tract. We hypothesized preceding patient selection using PC would improve the successful rate of colon capsule endoscopy (CCE). Therefore, a prospective single-arm study using PC followed by CCE was conducted with a control group of CCE alone. Patients with suspected or known GI stenosis scheduled for CCE were enrolled. CCE was performed only when the PC was excreted out of the body within 33 hours of ingestion. Primary endpoint was the rate of observation of the entire GI tract within the duration of examination. The secondary endpoints were complications and CCE findings. Twenty-three patients (17 men) were enrolled. The mean age was 50.5Â±19.8 years. Suspected stenotic sites were 8, 5, and 10 in the small, large, and small and large bowel, respectively. Sixteen, 12, and 10 patients had abdominal pain, active inflammatory bowel disease, and history of surgery for suspected stenosis, respectively. Patency of GI tract was confirmed in 96% (22/23) of the patients by administered PC. Of the 22 patients who underwent CCE, the entire GI tract was observed in 86% (19/22). No complications were observed. The median transit times in the small bowel and colon were 99 (21-682) and 160 (5-328) minutes, respectively. CCE findings revealed ulcers, erosions, and diverticula in 5, 9, and 4 patients, respectively. In conclusion, CCE with PC might be a safer and useful modality to observe the large colon for patients with suspected GI stenosis.
