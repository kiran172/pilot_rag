Title: Cave-in decompression technique in percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy for ossification occupation in lumbar spinal canal: A retrospective analysis of 23 cases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Percutaneous endoscopic transforaminal discectomy (PETD) for the treatment of ossification occupation of the lumbar spinal canal is technically demanding. The purpose of this study was to describe an endoscopic cave-in decompression technique in PETD for ossification occupation of the lumbar spinal canal and to report the clinical results.
METHODS: From May 2018 to June 2020, 23 consecutive cases, diagnosed in our institution as ventral ossification in the lumbar spinal canal and treated with PETD, were evaluated. The endoscopic cave-in decompression technique was performed. We analyzed the clinical outcomes on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Perioperative data and complications rate were also recorded.
RESULTS: Mean follow-up was 15.7±2.8months. Mean preoperative VAS score for low-back pain was 5.65±1.43, and decreased to 0.57±0.5 at final follow-up. Mean preoperative VAS score for leg pain was 5.48±1.38, and decreased to 0.56±0.5 at final follow-up. Mean preoperative ODI score decreased from 33.04±5.28 preoperatively to 8.7±2.54 at last follow-up. One patient experienced transient postoperative hypoesthesia, and one developed a mild transient decline in muscle strength; both recovered progressively. Postoperative CT and MRI showed that the ossification was effectively removed and the nerve root and dural mater was completely decompressed in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The endoscopic cave-in decompression technique in PETD is a safe and effective treatment method for selected patients with ossification occupation of the lumbar spinal canal.
