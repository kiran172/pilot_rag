Title: [Chinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of venous reflux disorders of head and neck].

Abstract: Recently, due to the development of medical imaging technology, diseases related to the venous reflux disorders of head and neck have gradually attracted attention. Cerebral Venous Disease Branch of the Chinese Stroke Association developed "Chinese expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of venous reflux disorders of head and neck" after repeated discussions covering recent domestic and international advances. The consensus combines the available medical evidence and clinical practice experience, describes three most common types of venous reflux disorders of head and neck, including cerebral venous thrombosis, venous sinus stenosis and internal jugular vein stenosis, systematically summarizes the etiology and risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis and evaluation, treatment and prognosis, and puts forward 71 recommendations, thereby providing the reference for relevant clinicians and researchers.
