Title: Peak Aortic Valve Jet Velocity is an Independent Predictor of Mortality of Dialysis Patients Undergoing Open Surgery for Chronic Limb Threatening Ischemia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the impact of peak aortic jet velocity (Vmax) on the prognosis of patients undergoing open surgery for chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI).
METHODS: Between April 2015 and March 2022, 352 patients underwent infrainguinal open surgery for CLTI. Patients who met the following exclusion criteria were excluded: subsequent infrainguinal surgeries in the registered period, no record of Vmax, history of aortic valve intervention, and Vmax ≥3.0 m/s (moderate or severe aortic valve stenosis). The remaining patients were dichotomized into 2 groups based on their Vmax values. The Youden index calculated from the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was set as the cutoff value. The 2-year overall survival (OS), calculated using the Kaplan-Meier's method, was compared between the 2 groups. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was performed using perioperative factors including Vmax to identify independent predictors separately for dialysis and nondialysis patients and the quantitative relationship between Vmax and OS.
RESULTS: One hundred and ninety-one patients, including 100 dialysis and 91 nondialysis patients, were included in the analysis. The Youden index was 1.7 m/s. The 2-year OS rates of the group with Vmax >1.7 m/s and with Vmax ≤1.7 m/s were 49% and 76% (P = 0.007), respectively, in the dialysis cohort, while they were 71% and 78% (P = 0.680) in the nondialysis cohort, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified Vmax and ejection fraction as independent predictors in the dialysis cohort and the Barthel Index at admission in the nondialysis cohort. There was a stepwise increase in the risk of death in patients with Vmax of ≥1.5 m/s and a significantly higher risk of death in dialysis patients with Vmax >2.5 m/s.
CONCLUSIONS: Vmax was a significant independent predictor of all-cause death within 2 years after open surgery for CLTI in dialysis patients but not in patients managed without dialysis.
