Title: Impact of right ventriculotomy on cardiac function after pulmonary valve sparing repair of tetralogy of Fallot and double outlet right ventricle with pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary valve-sparing repair of tetralogy of Fallot and double outlet right ventricle with pulmonary stenosis has the advantage of reduced incidence of late pulmonary valve regurgitation and better-preserved cardiac function. However, a right ventriculotomy is sometimes necessary in order to adequately relieve subvalvular pulmonary stenosis. We aimed to compare postoperative cardiac function and patients' symptoms between pulmonary valve-sparing repair with and without right ventriculotomy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from electronic medical records of Ramathibodi Hospital from 1st January 2013 to 31st October 2023. Patients diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot and double outlet right ventricle with pulmonary stenosis who underwent pulmonary valve-sparing repair were included. Patients who underwent other types of repairs and whose medical record data were significantly missing were excluded. Demographic data, operative, and postoperative details were collected and reviewed.
RESULTS: There were 49 patients included in our study with 10 patients undergoing pulmonary valve-sparing repair with and the other 39 without right ventriculotomy. Before-discharge echocardiographic parameters were generally similar between both groups (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion = 0.9 versus 0.89 cm, P = 0.737; pressure gradient across pulmonary valve across pulmonary valve = 24 versus 19 mmHg, P = 0.275; left ventricular end-systolic volume index = 17.84 versus 19.19 ml/m2, P = 0.437; left ventricular end-diastolic volume index = 63.79 versus 61.13 ml/m2, P = 0.436). Patients' symptoms were also not statistically different. There was no early and late death up to the end date of our study.
CONCLUSIONS: Right ventriculotomy in pulmonary valve-sparing repair did not result in worse postoperative cardiac function and symptoms. This suggested that the previously thought-to-be hazardous incision could be strongly considered if mandated.
