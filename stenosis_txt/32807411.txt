Title: Predictors of atrial fibrillation detection and features of recurrent strokes in patients after cryptogenic stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Use of implantable cardiac monitors (ICMs) has increased diagnosis of atrial fibrillation (AF) in cryptogenic stroke (CS) patients. Identifying AF predictors may enhance the yield of AF detection. Recurrent strokes after CS are not well described. We aimed to assess the predictors for AF detection and the characteristics of recurrent strokes in patients after CS.
METHODS: We reviewed electronic medical records of CS patients who were admitted between February 2014 and September 2017 and underwent ICM placement with minimum one-year follow-up. Patient demographics, stroke characteristics, pre-defined risk factors as well as recurrent strokes were compared between patients with and without AF detection.
RESULTS: 389 patients with median follow-up of 548 days were studied. AF was detected in 102 patients (26.2%). Age (per decade increase, OR 2.10, CI 1.64-2.68, with vs. without AF) and left atrium diameter (per 5 mm increase, OR 1.91, CI 1.33-2.74) were identified as AF predictors. Intracranial large vessel stenosis >50% irrelevant to the index strokes was associated with AF detection within 30 days (OR 0.24, CI 0.09-0.69, >30 vs. <30 days). Recurrent strokes occurred in 14% patients with median follow-up about 2.5 years. Topography of these strokes resembled embolic pattern and was comparable between patients with and without AF. Among recurrent strokes in patients with AF, the median time to AF detection was much shorter (90 vs. 251 days), and the median time to first stroke recurrence was much longer (422 vs. 76 days) in patients whose strokes recurred after AF detection than those before AF detection.
CONCLUSIONS: Older age and enlarged left atrium are predictors for AF detection in CS patients. Intracranial atherosclerosis is more prevalent in patients with early AF detection within 30 days. Recurrent strokes follow the embolic pattern, and early AF detection could delay the stroke recurrence.
