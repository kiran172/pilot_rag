Title: Complete transcatheter versus complete surgical management for combined aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease: A false dichotomy?

Abstract: Coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis often occur concomitantly owing to their shared risk factor profile. While standard management of these patients has been through surgical methods including surgical aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting, recent studies have investigated the potential role of complete transcatheter management (i.e., transcatheter aortic valve implantation and percutaneous coronary intervention) for these patients. In this editorial, we discuss the growing body of evidence suggesting long-term risks of transcatheter interventions despite their short-term benefits and also look to the future of hybrid approaches for multifaceted structural heart pathologies.
