Title: Imaging of the Mitral Valve.

Abstract: Echocardiographic imaging is the foundation for the evaluation of mitral valve dysfunction. Both transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography provide insight into the anatomy, pathology, and classification mitral valve dysfunction. Echocardiography also provides a multi-parametric approach with semi-quantitative and quantitative parameters to assess the severity of mitral regurgitation and mitral stenosis. Transesophageal imaging is essential in the assessment of patients considered for surgical or transcatheter interventional strategies to treat mitral valve dysfunction. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) and cardiac MRI are useful adjunctive imaging techniques in mitral valve disease with CT providing detailed procedural specificity and MRI providing detailed ventricular and regurgitant flow analysis.
