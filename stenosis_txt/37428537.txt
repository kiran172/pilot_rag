Title: Cardiac surgery simulation: step-by-step Nicks procedure in a preclinical model.

Abstract: We demonstrate the Nicks operation, one of the posterior aortic root enlargement procedures, on a preclinical model (porcine heart). The goal of this operation is to facilitate the implementation of a suitably sized aortic prosthetic valve. The procedure is performed by making a longitudinal incision through the non-coronary sinus without entering the fibrous body between the aortic valve and the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve and inserting a patch to enlarge the annulus.
