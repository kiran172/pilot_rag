Title: A Rare Case Report of C1 Posterior Arch and C2 Laminae Hypertrophy Causing Cervical Myelopathy.

Abstract: Cervical canal stenosis, localized to upper cervical spine, is very rare which can be developmental or acquired. Hypertrophic osteoarthritis accompanied by dens hypertrophy, hypertrophy of the osodontoideum, ossification of the transverse atlantal ligament, aplasia or developmental defect of the posterior arches of Atlas, and unilateral lateral mass hypertrophy are some of the rare reported conditions causing cervical myelopathy. Localized upper cervical canal stenosis due to hypertrophied C1 posterior arch and C2 laminae hypertrophy as an isolated cause of cervical myelopathy has not been reported earlier to our knowledge. We report a case of cervical myelopathy in a 52-year-old gentleman due to the hypertrophied posterior arch of atlas and laminae of axis. C2 laminectomy along with removal of the posterior arch of Atlas and decompression is the treatment. No adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy is needed. The knowledge of such an entity will avoid surprises in the diagnosis and facilitates the management.
