Title: Plasma levels of PRO-C3, a type III collagen synthesis marker, are associated with arterial stiffness and increased risk of cardiovascular death.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The N-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PRO-C3) assay measures a pro-peptide released during type III collagen synthesis, an important feature of arterial stiffening and atherogenesis. There is a clinical need for improved non-invasive, cheap and easily accessible methods for evaluating individuals at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In this study, we investigate the potential of using circulating levels of PRO-C3 to mark the degree of vascular stenosis and risk of cardiovascular events.
METHODS: Baseline plasma levels of PRO-C3 were measured by ELISA in subjects belonging to the SUrrogate markers for Micro- and Macro-vascular hard endpoints for Innovative diabetes Tools (SUMMIT) cohort (N = 1354). Associations between PRO-C3 levels with vascular characteristics, namely stiffness and stenosis, and risk of future cardiovascular events were explored. Subjects were followed up after a median of 35 months (interquartile range 34-36 months), with recorded outcomes cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: We found a correlation between PRO-C3 levels and pulse wave velocity (rho 0.13, p = 0.000009), a measurement of arterial stiffness. Higher PRO-C3 levels were also associated with elevated blood pressure (rho 0.07, p = 0.014), as well as risk of cardiovascular mortality over a three-year follow-up period (OR 1.56, confidence interval 1.008-2.43, p = 0.046).
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated circulating PRO-C3 levels are associated with arterial stiffness and future cardiovascular death, in the SUMMIT cohort, suggesting a potential value of PRO-C3 as a novel marker for declining vascular health.
