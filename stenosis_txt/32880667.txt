Title: From Other Journals: A Review of Recent Articles in Pediatric Cardiology.

Abstract: In this review, we provide a brief description of recently published articles addressing topics relevant to pediatric cardiologists. Our hope is to provide a summary of the latest articles published recently in other journals in our field. The articles address (1) pulmonary valve repair in patients with tetralogy of Fallot and in patients with congenital pulmonary stenosis which seems to be a promising technique in selected patients, (2) the use of Losartan in patients with Marfan syndrome mostly in addition to beta blockers may result in a lower aortic root dilation rate and better clinical outcomes, (3) a summary of the characteristics of adults with congenital heart disease in the USA showed a wide variation in prevalence, associated morbidities, health care utilization and insurance type in different locations in the USA, (4) a large single center study confirmed that right ventricular morphology is associated with worse outcomes after the Fontan operation and that atrioventricular valve regurgitation is an important predictor of worse outcomes and precedes ventricular dysfunction post Fontan operation, (5) a large study describing the multi system inflammatory syndrome in children temporarily related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA showing that ventricular dysfunction is the most common cardiac manifestation (6) the reality of "limping to transplantation" showing that patients with one or more modifiable risk factors including mechanical ventilation, kidney or liver dysfunction are at significant increase risk post cardiac transplantation.
