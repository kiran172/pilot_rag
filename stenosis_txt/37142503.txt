Title: Diagnostic value of new biliary biopsy cannulae for malignant bile duct strictures via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography pathway.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) plays a major role in the diagnosis of malignant biliary strictures. ERCP fluoroscopy-guided biliary biopsy is more sensitive than brushing, but it is more difficult to perform and less successful. Therefore, a new technique of biliary biopsy using a new biliary biopsy cannula via the ERCP route was developed in our center with the aim of improving the diagnosis rate of malignant biliary strictures.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study that included 42 patients who underwent ERCP-guided biliary brushing and biliary biopsy for biliary strictures using a new biliary biopsy cannula in our department from January 2019 to May 2022. The final diagnosis was determined after brushing, biliary biopsy under the new biliary biopsy cannula or adequate follow-up. Diagnostic rates were calculated and analyzed for relevant factors.
RESULTS: The satisfactory rates of pathological specimens of 42 patients who underwent bile duct biopsy with bile duct brush and new bile duct biopsy cannula were 57.14% and 95.24% respectively. Cholangiocarcinoma was diagnosed in 45.23% and 83.30% of the samples by biliary brush examination and biliary biopsy using the new biliary biopsy cannula, respectively (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The ERCP route using a new biliary biopsy cannula for biliary biopsy technique can improve pathology positivity and benefit ratio. It provides a new approach in the diagnosis of malignant stenosis in the bile duct.
