Title: Thoracolumbar stenosis and neurologic symptoms: Quantitative MRI in achondroplasia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Whole-spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, to identify structural abnormalities associated with the development of symptomatic spinal stenosis in achondroplasia.
METHODS: Forty-two subjects with achondroplasia were grouped into four age-related categories. Congenital spinal deformities (vertebral body and disc height, interpedicular distance), acquired spinal degenerative changes, thoracic kyphotic (TK) angle, thoracolumbar kyphotic (TLK) angle, spinal canal widths were evaluated by MRI.
RESULTS: Patients in the first three groups were asymptomatic and younger (group 1: 4.4 ± 0.78 years; group 2: 8.18 ± 0.60 years; group 3: 10.95 ± 0.93 years) than the symptomatic group (group 4: 23 ± 1.30 years). Patients showed height of vertebral bodies, whole canal width, and average lumbar interpedicular distance reduced. Discs degeneration was more pronounced in the lumbar region and in symptomatic adult patients. TK and TLK angles showed a positive correlation with age (p &lt; .05, r = .42; p &lt; .05, r = .41), whereas thoracic and thoracolumbar canal width had a negative correlation (p &lt; .05, r = -.69; p &lt; .05, r = -.58). A negative correlation between lumbar discs degeneration and canal width was found only at L1-L3 level (p &lt; .05, r = -.35). At L1-L3, the canal width cutoff value of .59 allowed the differentiation between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients (area under the curve of .966, p &lt; .0001).
CONCLUSION: In achondroplasia, the spinal canal narrowing, due to accelerated degenerative changes, is a predisposing factor of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis. Lumbar canal MRI is a helpful tool to detect the risk of the development of neurological symptoms; in adult patients, a stenosis higher than 60% of upper lumbar canal could be a critical value for the onset of neurological symptoms.
