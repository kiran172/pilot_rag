Title: [The use of platelet-rich plasma in the treatment of cicatricial stenosis of the larynx and cervical trachea].

Abstract: Despite the technical achievements of recent years in medicine, the problem of frequent recurrent stricture formation of the lumen of larynx and cervical trachea remains urgent. The etiology and pathogenesis of development of scar stenosis of the larynx and trachea were considered, and the analysis of the drugs' use for topical therapy in the comprehensive treatment of this pathology was conducted in the presented review. Special attention was paid to plasma enriched with platelets, its use in otorhinolaryngology, in particular in the treatment of laryngeal diseases. Positive and negative sides of the adjuvant therapy use have been identified. The search for means helping to prevent recurrent stricture formation of laryngeal lumen and cervical trachea determines the interest of the considered problem.
