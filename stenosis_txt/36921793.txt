Title: Does Modified Rankin Score (mRS) Matter? The Impact of Stroke Severity on Carotid Artery Endarterectomy (CEA) Outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery endarterectomy (CEA) is recommended to reduce stroke risk in patients following nondisabling ischemic stroke (modified Rankin Score mRS<3). We reviewed CEA outcomes in patients after more devastating strokes (mRS≥3).
METHODS: An observational cohort study was performed, and data were collected from 1013 CEA cases over 15 years. Patient demographics, comorbidities and postoperative outcomes were compared between preoperative mRS<3 (Group 1) and mRS≥3 (Group 2). Statistical significance was determined by P < 0.05.
RESULTS: Ninety-one (9%) patients were mRS ≥3. There was no significant difference between age, gender, and operated side. Group 2 had significantly higher rates of diabetes and frailty. There was no significant difference in anesthetic type. Group 2 spent longer in High Dependency. Return to theater and postoperative complications were similar. Incidence of perioperative stroke, mortality, and readmission rates were not significant at 30 days postoperation between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a higher mRS have more preoperative comorbidities but short-term perioperative complication rate is not significantly different. Patient selection should be undertaken with care.
