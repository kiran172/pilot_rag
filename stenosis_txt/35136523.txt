Title: Congenital Central Overinflation with Mainstem Bronchial Stenosis: Pre- and Postnatal Imaging and Outcome-Case Report and Brief Review of Literature.

Abstract: Congenital overinflation of lung is underdiagnosed prenatally as the imaging features of the same are not well described. We describe a very rare case of central variety of congenital overinflation, secondary to right mainstem bronchial stenosis, not previously described in our knowledge, which presented as an enlarged homogenous echogenic/hyperintense lung with cardio-mediastinal shift and was misdiagnosed as congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM). We reviewed imaging features helpful in prenatal diagnosis of this condition on ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging and discussed an approach for differential diagnosis. The congenital central overinflation may be considered in prenatal detected echogenic lung lesions with the absence of cysts or systemic arterial supply and presence of hypervascularity or dilated bronchi within the lesion.
