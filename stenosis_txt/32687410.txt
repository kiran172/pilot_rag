Title: Case Report of Acute Airway Obstruction Caused by Transglottic Squamous Carcinoma (Stage IV) During the Coronavirus Pandemic Cured by ECMO-Assisted Tracheostomy.

Abstract: Acute airway obstruction caused by invasive laryngeal cancer can make surgeons reluctant to perform a high-risk tracheostomy, which is life-saving for such patients. In the setting of the current COVID19 pandemic, we present a case of severe transglottic stenosis due to stage IV laryngeal carcinoma, in which gaseous exchange was facilitated by venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation prior to emergent tracheostomy. The VV technique can ensure adequate oxygenation and CO<sub>2</sub> removal. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation provided sufficient time for surgical planning and preparation. It reduced the formation of aerosol, lowered the risk associated with life-saving tracheostomy, and protected the patient from ischemia.
