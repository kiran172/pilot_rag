Title: Crossed raised arm position improves the flow of contrast medium in torso contrast-enhanced computed Tomography.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This retrospective cohort study examined the effects of the crossed raised arm (CRA) position in contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) on contrast medium influx and image quality relative to the conventional position.
METHODS: Contrast medium influx into the collateral veins on CECT images was evaluated in 92 participants. The CT values of the pulmonary artery, descending aorta, and spleen were obtained in both positions and compared. Anatomical changes in the diameters and area of the subclavian vein and costoclavicular distance were also analyzed.
RESULTS: Contras 27 and 6 patients in the conventional and CRA positions, respectively. The influx risk ratio in the CRA position versus that in the conventional position was 0.22 (95% confidence interval, 0.10-0.51). Elevations in the median CT value of the pulmonary artery, descending aorta, and spleen in the CRA position were 7.0% (p < .001), 7.4% (p < .001), and 9.8% (p < .001), respectively. Enlargements in the major and minor diameters of the subclavian vein, subclavian vein area, and costoclavicular distance in the CRA position versus those in the conventional position were 19.3% (p < .001), 28.1% (p < .001), 53.6%, and 30.0% (p < .001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The CRA position effectively prevented contrast medium influx into the collateral veins due to SVS and increased CT values in the target organs in CECT. The diameters and area of the subclavian vein and costoclavicular distance were enlarged at the thoracic outlet, which improved the flow of the contrast medium into the targeted organs.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The CRA position can contribute to obtaining better CECT images during common clinical assessments at no additional cost.
