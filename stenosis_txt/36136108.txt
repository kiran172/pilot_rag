Title: Plaque modification and stabilization after drug-coated balloon angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic lesions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: A drug-coated balloon (DCB) has potential applications in the treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). We aimed to evaluate changes of vessel wall features of ICAD lesions after DCB treatment by using vessel wall MRI (VWMRI).
METHODS: We retrospectively included patients with symptomatic ICAD who underwent DCB angioplasty alone. The incidences of stenosis of the lumen area, vessel wall thickening, hyperintense plaques, and prominent wall enhancement were compared between the baseline and follow-up VWMRI.
RESULTS: There were 29 ICAD lesions from 29 patients, of which 22 were stenosis and 7 were occlusion. The median interval between DCB treatment and follow-up VWMRI was 4.1 [3.3, 6.7] months. After DCB treatment, follow-up VWMRI showed a significant decrease in the stenosis degree of the lumen area (83% [71%, 96%] vs 15% [3%, 41%], p < 0.001). Thirty-eight percent (11/29) of the patients observed normal appearance of the target vessel wall on follow-up VWMRI. In the stenosis group, the prevalence of hyperintense plaques decreased from 66.7% (14/21) at baseline to 23.8% (5/21) at follow-up, and prominent wall enhancement decreased from 66.7% (14/21) at baseline to 19.0%(4/21) at follow-up. The incidence of hyperintense plaques (p = 0.028) and vessel wall thickening (p = 0.018) tended to decrease with follow-up time. Although not significant (p = 0.106), a similar trend was observed between the incidence of prominent wall enhancement and follow-up time.
CONCLUSION: Vascular healing with plaque modification and stabilization occurred following DCB treatment of ICAD lesions.
KEY POINTS: • A drug-coated balloon (DCB) has potential applications in the treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). • Vascular healing with plaque modification and stabilization occurred following DCB treatment of ICAD lesions.
