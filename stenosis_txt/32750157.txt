Title: Hemodynamics inside the neo- and native sinus after TAVR: Effects of implant depth and cardiac output on flow field and coronary flow.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a widely used therapy for aortic valve diseases. With TAVR, flow hemodynamics may change leading to areas of flow stagnation prone to thrombosis risk. The neo-sinus, created by introducing a prosthesis inside the diseased native valve, may prompt leaflet thrombosis due to areas of flow stasis. This study attempted to understand the effect of different prosthesis implant depths on the flow field within the neo- and native sinus and on the coronary perfusion. Experiments were performed inside an in vitro pulse duplicator producing physiological conditions according to ISO 5840-1:2015 standard. Flow fields were obtained for two cardiac outputs (CO) using particle image velocimetry (PIV). Washout was calculated as a measure of flow stasis. The two main results are: a lower implant position and a lower CO/frequency led to better native sinus washout, but worsened neo-sinus washout. In contrast, a higher implant position led to higher coronary flow (for higher CO/frequency). No significant effect of implant depth on coronary flow was observed for lower CO/frequency. In summary, a higher implant position using this self-expanding prosthesis is associated with reduced neo-sinus flow stasis. Hereby, washout of the native sinus, as well as coronary flow, are dependent on cardiac output.
