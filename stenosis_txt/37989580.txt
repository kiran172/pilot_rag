Title: Vessel wall MRI characteristics associated with intraprocedural stent thrombosis during angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Few studies have so far explored plaque characteristics on high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (HR-VWI) associated with intraprocedural stent thrombosis (IPST) during angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). We aimed to investigate the plaque features on HR-VWI associated with IPST during stenting for ICAS.
METHODS: This study recruited 77 patients with ICAS who underwent intracranial stenting using the Gateway-Wingspan system, and were performed with enhanced pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted HR-VWI on a 3.0T MRI scanner before angioplasty. During stenting for ICAS, eight patients (male: 100%, age mean ± standard deviation (SD): 58.7±2.47) developed IPST within 30 minutes after stenting. To ensure comparability, 16 patients who had undergone intracranial stenting but did not develop IPST were matched as controls for this study. Univariable and binary logistic models were used to explore the plaque characteristics on HR-VWI associated with IPST.
RESULTS: Patients who developed IPST had less plaque diffusion (37.50% vs 81.25%, p=0.036), a more severe degree of area stenosis (median 96.30% vs 81.65%, p<0.01), and a higher plaque enhancement index (median 37.99 vs 13.12, p<0.01) compared with those who did not. After multivariate adjustment, IPST was independently associated with a more severe degree of area stenosis (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.20, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.43, p=0.044) and a higher plaque enhancement index (adjusted OR 1.17, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.36, p=0.036).
CONCLUSION: Intraprocedural stent thrombosis during intracranial angioplasty for patients with ICAS may be independently associated with a higher plaque enhancement index and a more severe degree of area stenosis on HR-VWI.
