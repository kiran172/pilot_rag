Title: Management of vascular and nonvascular complications following pancreas transplantation with interventional radiology.

Abstract: Pancreas transplantation exposes to high rates of complications, either vascular (thrombosis, stenosis, pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous fistula) or nonvascular (fluid collection, graft rejection). With advances in percutaneous and endovascular techniques, interventional radiologists are increasingly involved in the management of these complications. In this article, we review the anatomical considerations relevant to pancreas transplantation, the techniques used for image-guided interventions for vascular and nonvascular complications, and the expected outcomes of these interventions.
