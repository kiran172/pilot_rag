Title: Perceval sutureless valve migration treated by valve-in-valve with a CoreValve Evolut Pro.

Abstract: In the last years, the use of sutureless devices in frail patients with severe aortic stenosis has increased thanks to their "easier and faster" technique of implantation in comparison to conventional surgery. Results from metanalysis show comparable outcomes in comparison to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in terms of mortality, stroke incidence, and rate of pace-maker implantation. The incidence of para-valvular leak (PVL) is even lower for sutureless devices than for TAVR. The few cases described are generally due to incomplete decalcification or incorrect valve sizing and consequent stent distortion. To our knowledge this is the first case describing PVL with massive aortic regurgitation due to early partial embolization of a Perceval valve and its successfully treatment with valve-in-valve by using a self-expanding TAVR device.
