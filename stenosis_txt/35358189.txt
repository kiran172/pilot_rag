Title: Assessing serum levels of SM22α as a new biomarker for patients with aortic aneurysm/dissection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic aneurysm/dissection (AAD) is now encountered more often because of the increasing prevalence of atherosclerosis and hypertension in the population. Despite many therapeutic improvements, in particular timely and successful surgery, in-hospital mortality rates are still higher. Timely identification of patients at high risk will help improve the overall prognosis of AAD. Since early clinical and radiological signs are nonspecific, there is an urgent need for accurate biomarkers. Smooth muscle 22α (SM22α) is a potential marker for AAD because of its abundant expression in vascular smooth muscle, which is involved in development of AAD.
METHODS: We prepared three different mouse models, including abdominal aortic aneurysm, neointimal hyperplasia and atherosclerosis. SM22α levels were assessed in serum and vascular tissue of the mice. Next, the relationships between serum SM22α level and vascular lesion were studied in mice. Finally, serum from 41 patients with AAD, 107 carotid artery stenosis (CAS) patients and 40 healthy volunteers were tested for SM22α. Serum levels of SM22α were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: Compared with the controls, serum SM22α levels were reduced in the models of aortic aneurysm, neointimal formation and atherosclerosis, and elevated in mice with ruptured aneurysm. Serum SM22α level was negatively correlated with apoptosis rate of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), ratio of intima/ media (I/M) area and plaque size. Patients with AAD had significantly higher serum SM22α levels than patients with only CAS, or normal controls.
CONCLUSION: Serum SM22α could be a potential predictive marker for AAD, and regulation of VSMC is a possible mechanism for the effects of SM22α.
