Title: Biportal endoscopic transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion using a large cage for degenerative spondylolisthesis with stenosis.

Abstract: Recently, biportal endoscopic transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) has been used to treat lumbar degenerative diseases, such as lumbar instability and spondylolisthesis. Biportal endoscopic TLIF may have the advantages of endoscopic spine approaches and minimally invasive lumbar fusion surgeries. In this biportal endoscopic TLIF, large cages similar to oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) cages have been used. Biportal endoscopic TLIF using a large cage can be successfully performed in the lower lumbar area. The author presents the surgical technique of biportal endoscopic TLIF using a large cage.
