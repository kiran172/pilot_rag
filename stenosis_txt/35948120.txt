Title: Appropriateness of Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement for Severe Aortic Stenosis Is Increasing.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The adoption of transcatheter aortic valve replacement led to the development of appropriate use criteria (AUC) for transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for aortic stenosis in 2017. This study hypothesized that appropriateness of SAVR improved after publication of AUC.
METHODS: All patients undergoing isolated SAVR for severe aortic stenosis in a regional cardiac surgical quality collaborative were evaluated using data from the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database (2011-2021). After excluding endocarditis and emergency cases, appropriateness of SAVR (rarely appropriate, may be appropriate, or appropriate) was assigned to patients by using established criteria. The relationship of appropriateness with publication of AUC was assessed, as was variation in appropriateness over time and by center.
RESULTS: Of 3035 patients across 17 centers, 106 (3.5%) underwent SAVR for an indication identified as rarely appropriate or may be appropriate. Patients who underwent SAVR for rarely or may be appropriate indications were significantly more likely to experience operative mortality (5.7% vs 1.6%, P = .001) as well as major morbidity (21.7% vs 10.5%, P < .001). Performance of rarely or may be appropriate SAVR significantly decreased over time (slope -0.51%/year, P trend < .001), and it was decreased after the release of the AUC (before release, 3.83% vs after release, 2.06%; P = .036). Substantial interhospital variation in appropriateness was observed (range of may be or rarely appropriate SAVR, 0%-10%).
CONCLUSIONS: The majority of isolated SAVR for aortic stenosis was appropriate according to the 2017 AUC. Appropriateness improved after publication of AUC, and this improvement was associated with a significant reduction of major morbidity and mortality.
