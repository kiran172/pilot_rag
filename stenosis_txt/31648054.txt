Title: Susceptibility of Cervical Spinal Stenosis to Hypoxic-Ischemic Cord Injury.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The adult spinal cord is typically resistant to hypoxic-ischemic injury because of collateral blood supply; however, congenital or acquired stenosis may result in baseline maximal vasodilation, such as superimposed hemodynamic stresses, that cannot be accommodated, leaving the spinal cord vulnerable to ischemic injury. We present a rare case of spinal cord hypoxic-ischemic injury in an adult with underlying cervical spinal stenosis.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 37-year-old man with a history of morbid obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea presented after developing progressive weakness in the extremities. Preoperative computed tomography myelography demonstrated ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament and severe spinal canal narrowing. Approximately 1 week after posterior decompression, the patient experienced spinal hypoxic-ischemic injury. Imaging revealed cord expansion and abnormal T2 signal intensity. Axial diffusion tensor images of the brain revealed delayed ischemic leukoencephalopathy with restricted diffusion in the cerebral cortex and deep white matter; this led to the decision to withdraw care, and the patient died.
CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that vascular dysregulation due to cervical stenosis made the cord parenchyma vulnerable to hypoxic and/or hypoperfusion stresses.
