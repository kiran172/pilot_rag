Title: Exploring the role of pericardial miRNAs and exosomes in modulating cardiac fibrosis.

Abstract: The potential of the pericardial space as a therapeutic delivery tool for cardiac fibrosis and heart failure (HF) treatment has yet to be elucidated. Recently, miRNAs and exosomes have been discovered to be present in human pericardial fluid (PF). Novel studies have shown characteristic human PF miRNA compositions associated with cardiac diseases and higher miRNA expressions in PF compared to peripheral blood. Five key studies found differentially expressed miRNAs in HF, angina pectoris, aortic stenosis, ventricular tachycardia, and congenital heart diseases with either atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm. As miRNA-based therapeutics for cardiac fibrosis and HF showed promising results in several in vivo studies for multiple miRNAs, we hypothesize a potential role of miRNA-based therapeutics delivered through the pericardial cavity. This is underlined by the favorable results of the first phase 1b clinical trial in this emerging field. Presenting the first human miRNA antisense drug trial, inhibition of miR-132 by intravenous administration of a novel antisense oligonucleotide, CDR132L, established efficacy in reducing miR-132 in plasma samples in a dose-dependent manner. We screened the literature, provided an overview of the miRNAs and exosomes present in PF, and drew a connection to those miRNAs previously elucidated in cardiac fibrosis and HF. Further, we speculate about clinical implications and potential delivery methods.
