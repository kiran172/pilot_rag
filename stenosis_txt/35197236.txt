Title: Percutaneous closure of an iatrogenic ventricular septal defect associated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: An 81-year-old man who had dyspnea was admitted to our hospital with a diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis. A transcatheter aortic valve implantation was successfully performed with a 29 mm Edwards Sapien XT valve using a transfemoral access. After the procedure, the echocardiography showed a restrictive ventricular septal defect (VSD) in the membranous septum. As the patient had no symptoms, it was decided to follow him up conservatively. However, he was readmitted within three weeks with symptoms suggestive of biventricular failure. A control echocardiography revealed a membranous VSD, 8 mm in size, right chambers dilatation with moderate tricuspid regurgitation, and systolic pulmonary artery pressure of 60 mm Hg. The previously deployed aortic valve was normal in function. The decision to perform a percutaneous VSD closure was made. The defect was then closed with a 10 mm muscular VSD occluder. During and after the procedure, there was no dysfunction in the bioprosthetic aortic valve. At the one-year follow-up, the patient was still asymptomatic.
