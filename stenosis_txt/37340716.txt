Title: Acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction as the first manifestation of Takayasu arteritis in a 16-year-old female patient: a case report and literature review.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is now recognized worldwide and is a disease that mainly affects the aorta and its main branches. TA rarely involves the small or medium-sized vessels. Certain vascular lesions, such as arterial stenosis, occlusion, and aneurysm are common with TA. However, patients with new-onset TA who present with left main trunk acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction are extremely rare. We report a 16-year-old female patient with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction due to severe stenosis of the left main coronary artery that was caused by TA. She was eventually diagnosed with TA and underwent successful coronary artery stenting combined with glucocorticoids and folate reductase inhibitor therapy. Over the 1-year follow-up, she experienced two episodes of chest pain and was admitted to the hospital. During the second hospitalization, coronary angiography (CAG) revealed 90% stenosis of the original left main trunk (LM) stent. Following percutaneous coronary angiography (PTCA), drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty was performed. Fortunately, a clear diagnosis of TA was made, and treatment was initiated with an interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor inhibitor. Early diagnosis and therapy for TA are emphasized.
