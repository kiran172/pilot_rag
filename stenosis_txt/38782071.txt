Title: Long-term outcomes in patients with bicuspid valve stenosis and aortic dilation undergoing transcatheter valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To date, whether ascending aorta dilation (AAD) should be considered a contraindication for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains a topic of debate..
OBJECTIVE: The study investigated the clinical outcome of TAVR in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (BAV-AS) complicated by AAD.
METHODS: We included patients with BAV-AS who underwent TAVR between 2012 and 2019. We collected patient perioperative clinical data., tracked clinical outcomes for over four years post-TAVR, and obtained echocardiography images one year postoperatively. The Kaplan-Meier method was employed for analyzing both unadjusted and adjusted survival data, which was compared using the log-rank test. COX regression and nomograms were used to assess the impact of AAD on post-TAVR clinical outcomes in patients with aortic stenosis (AS), with all-cause mortality as the primary clinical endpoint.
RESULTS: A total of 111 BAV patients were included in this study. Long-term follow-up showed an increased mortality risk in patients with BAV-AAD (adjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis: P = .02/0.001). Cox correlation analysis indicated that age (OR = 1.137; P = .034), AAD (OR = 3.51; P = .038), and postoperative left ventricular pressure (LVSP) (OR: 0.959; P = .044) were predictive factors for mortality more than four years after TAVR in patients with BAV. The area under the curve of the Nomogram predicting long-term survival for the training set of patients based on the above metrics was 0.845 (95% CI: 0.696-0.994). Short-term cardiac ultrasound follow-up showed a more rapid rate of AA expansion (0.29 [0-0.34] vs. -1 [-3.3-1] mm/month, P = .001) and a smaller proportion of AA diameter reduction (7.1% vs. 53.7%, P = .001) in patients who died.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BAV-AAD-AS treated with TAVR have an increased risk of long-term mortality, and clinical prediction models, including AAD age and postoperative LVSP, may predict long-term patient survival.
CONDENSED ABSTRACT: The study investigated the clinical outcome of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients with bicuspid aortic valve stenosis (BAV-AS) complicated by ascending aorta dilation (AAD). Patients with BAV-AAD-AS treated with TAVR have an increased risk of long-term mortality. AAD, age and postoperative LVSP, may predict long-term patient survival. Short-term cardiac ultrasound follow-up showed a more rapid rate of AA expansion and a smaller proportion of AA diameter reduction in patients who died. A high postoperative AAD expansion rate may indicate an adverse clinical outcome. Surgery regimens for tolerable BAV-AADs and can be considered as a treatment option.
