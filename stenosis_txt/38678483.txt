Title: A case of Kommerell diverticulum in adolescence presented with dysphagia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Kommerell diverticulum (KD) with right aortic arch and aberrant left subclavian artery (ALSCA) is a rare congenital aortic anomaly. To improve organ compression symptoms and avoid rupture of aneurysms in adulthood (19 years old-), surgical treatment is considered the only curative option. However, in childhood (-18 years old), several problems regarding approach and technique selection have been reported. Surgical treatment for KD in infancy (birth-2 years old) has been reported recently, but rarely in adolescence (13-19 years old). We herein report a case of KD in which the patient underwent graft replacement during adolescence.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 13-year-old boy was admitted to our hospital presenting with dysphagia and body weight loss. Esophagography showed upper esophageal stenosis caused by extrinsic compression. Contrast-enhanced computer tomography showed saccular aneurysm formation of KD with right aortic arch (RAA) and ALSCA. Elective surgery including KD resection and graft replacement of the descending aorta was performed via right thoracotomy under partial extracorporeal circulation. The ALSCA was reconstructed by graft interposition. No postoperative complication was observed. Follow-up esophagography showed no residual stenosis.
CONCLUSION: We experienced a case of KD with dysphagia and weight loss in adolescence, which was successfully treated with surgery. Graft replacement could be an effective treatment option, facilitating recovery even during the growth period.
