Title: Anesthesia for Resection and Reconstruction of the Trachea and Carina.

Abstract: Airway surgery poses a host of unique challenges to both the surgical and anesthesiology teams. Accordingly, there are a variety of surgical, anesthetic, and airway management options to be strategically considered. Management can be challenging during multidisciplinary preoperative planning, during the surgical procedure itself, and during recovery. In this review, emphasis is placed on anesthesia challenges for patients undergoing major tracheal or carinal surgery with specific considerations related to perioperative management.
