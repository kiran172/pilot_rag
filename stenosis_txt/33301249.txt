Title: Fast-track recovery for perforated duodenal ulcer.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the outcomes of fast-track recovery in patients with perforated duodenal ulcer (PDU).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 138 patients with PDU who underwent surgical treatment for the period from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019. Patients were divided into 3 groups: main group, control group 1 (CG-1) and control group 2 (CG-2). The main group (fast-track group, FT-group) included 51 patients who underwent laparoscopic suturing of PDU followed by enhanced recovery (fast-track). CG-1 comprised 44 patients who underwent open suturing of PDU and conventional perioperative treatment. CG-2 consisted of 43 patients who underwent laparoscopic suturing and conventional perioperative treatment. Complications were assessed using Clavien-Dindo grading system.
RESULTS: In the FT group, postoperative complications were observed in 2 patients (3.92%). Anemia of mixed genesis (Clavien-Dindo grade II) was diagnosed in 1 patient and left-sided lower lobe pneumonia in another one (grade II). There were no deaths. Mean length of hospital-stay was 3.86 days. In the 1st control group, the largest number of complications was observed (n=12, 27.27%) including 9 extra-abdominal complications (pulmonary disorders (II) - 7 patients (15.9%); sepsis (IVB) - 1 (2.27%), delirium (IVA) - 1 patient (2.27%), postoperative wound seroma (IIIA) - 1 (2.27%) patient). Intra-abdominal complications consisted of compensated pyloroduodenal stenosis (II) in 1 (2.27%) case, recurrent bleeding from acute gastric and duodenal ulcers (IIIB) in 1 (2.27%) patient. Mortality rate was 4.54% (n=2) in this group (progressive multiple organ failure). Mean length of hospital-stay was 7.56 days. In the 2nd control group, postoperative complications included extra-abdominal (pulmonary disorders (II) - pneumonia in 4 (9.3%) cases, spontaneous pneumothorax (IIIA) in 1 (2.32%) case) and intra-abdominal events (duodenitis (II) in 1 (2.32%) patient and compensated pyloroduodenal stenosis (II) in another 1 (2.32%) patient). There were no lethal outcomes in this group. Mean length of hospital-stay was 6.7 days.
CONCLUSION: Treatment outcomes in patients with perforated duodenal ulcer confirmed an effectiveness of laparoscopic suturing and complete abdominal sanitation. These measures create the prerequisites for fast track recovery in urgent surgical practice. FT-protocol of inpatient management is followed by reduced hospital-stay and less incidence of postoperative complications. Moreover, this approach promotes early and safe discharge of patients.
