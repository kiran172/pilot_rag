Title: A novel application of Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange via the oral route in morbidly obese patient during monitored anesthesia care - A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transnasal Humidified Rapid Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange (THRIVE) is used to improve oxygenation, with the added benefit of a smaller increase in CO<sub>2</sub> if self-respiration is maintained with THRIVE. Despite these advantages, the use of THRIVE through a nasal cannula is limited in situations such as epistaxis or a basal skull fracture.
CASE: We successful used THRIVE, through the oral route under general anesthesia with spontaneous breathing in a morbidly obese patient (weight, 148 kg; height, 183 cm; body mass index, 44.2 kg/m2) who received transnasal steroid injections due to subglottic stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: THRIVE through the oral route may be an effective novel option, although further studies are needed.
