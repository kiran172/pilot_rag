Title: Impact of malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein on clinical outcomes after fractional flow reserve-guided deferral of revascularization.

Abstract: Cardiovascular events can occur after deferred revascularization, and malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) has been suggested to be an atherogenic marker. We investigated the relationship between serum MDA-LDL levels and clinical outcomes in patients with fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided deferral of revascularization. Among 3084 patients undergoing coronary angiography, we retrospectively analyzed 127 patients with intermediate stenosis and deferred revascularization based on FFR > 0.80. Median follow-up interval was 30.4 months, and serum MDA-LDL was measured prior to the measurement of FFR. We evaluated the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven deferred lesion revascularization, and any revascularization. MACEs occurred in 18 (14.2%) patients. The MACE group presented with significantly higher MDA-LDL levels than the non-MACE group (134.9 ± 33.3 U/L vs. 95.6 ± 32.2 U/L, P < 0.001). In analysis of the receiver operating characteristics curve for the prediction of MACEs, MDA-LDL presented a significantly larger area under the curve than low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C; 0.810 vs. 0.687, P = 0.042). Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated a significant relationship between MACEs and MDA-LDL (per 10 U/L, HR 1.20; P = 0.004), as did the multivariate model (per 10 U/L, HR 1.17; P = 0.019). When compared according to the median LDL-C (98 mg/dL), the MACE group had significantly higher MDA-LDL in both the high (147.2 ± 27.3 U/L vs. 113.9 ± 31.2 U/L, P = 0.001) and low (103.2 ± 27.3 U/L vs. 80.2 ± 24.0 U/L, P = 0.045) LDL-C groups. Serum MDA-LDL levels were associated with cardiac events in patients with deferral of revascularization based on FFR.
