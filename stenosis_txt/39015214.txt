Title: Uncommon cause of radiculopathy: A case of symptomatic Tarlov cyst in an elderly female and literature review.

Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Tarlov cysts are uncommon causes of sacral radiculopathy, with particular predilection to second and third sacral roots, requiring timely diagnosis with lumbosacral MRI, and surgical management if symptomatic.
ABSTRACT: Tarlov cysts or Type II meningeal cysts, are CSF-filled sacs located in the extradural space of the sacral spinal canal, commonly originating at the dorsal root ganglion. While they were first documented by Tarlov in 1938, their etiology remains uncertain, with theories suggesting trauma-induced bleeding or congenital abnormalities. These cysts, estimated to affect between 1% and 9% of the adult population, typically manifest as incidental findings but may lead to symptoms such as radiculopathies, sacral pain, and weakness in related sacral muscles. We present a case of a 63-year-old female presenting with recurrent left buttock pain and radiating leg discomfort. Physical examination revealed tenderness in the left buttock region, positive straight leg raise test, and minimal sensory deficits in the S1-S2 dermatomes. A provisional diagnosis of radiculopathy was made, prompting further evaluation with MRI, revealing a Tarlov cyst and absence of lumbar spinal canal stenosis or neural foraminal compromise. The patient declined intervention and was managed conservatively. This case highlights the diagnostic challenges and therapeutic considerations in managing symptomatic Tarlov cysts, emphasizing the importance of tailored treatment strategies.
