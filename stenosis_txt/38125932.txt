Title: Reversible Bilateral Transverse Sinus Occlusion Treated by Lumboperitoneal Shunt in Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension: A Case Report.

Abstract: We report a patient with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with bilateral transverse sinus occlusion treated by a lumboperitoneal shunt. A 45-year-old woman presented with visual disturbance and chronic headache. Magnetic resonance (MR) venography and three-dimensional computed tomography angiography (3D-CTA) showed occlusion of both transverse sinuses. After the surgery, MR venography and 3D-CTA showed no blockages in both transverse sinuses. This phenomenon reveals that obstruction of the bilateral transverse sinus is a consequence of intracranial hypertension, not just a single cause. Since many patients have an obstruction or stenosis of the venous sinus, there are some reports of endovascular treatment. Sinus reconstruction is usually effective, but it is not effective in some cases. Reversal of sinus occlusion suggests that endovascular therapy for IIH is inadequate in some cases.
