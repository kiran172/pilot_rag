Title: Risk Factors of Severe Benign Cicatricial Stricture After Definitive Chemoradiation for Localized T3 Esophageal Carcinoma.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: Severe benign cicatricial stricture (SBCS) is a major complication after definitive chemoradiation therapy (dCRT) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). This study was conducted to investigate risk factors of SBCS in patients with localized ESCC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study included 197 patients with clinical stage (cSt) II/III ESCC with T3 primary tumor, treated with dCRT between 2000 and 2011. SBCS was defined as the inability to pass a 9-mm diameter endoscope or the presence of symptoms requiring treatment.
RESULTS: Complete response was obtained in 87 patients (44%). Multivariate analysis revealed that hypoalbuminemia (hazard ratio=5.65; 95% confidence interval=1.50-21.28; p=0.010) and the inability to pass an endoscope (hazard ratio=5.90; 95% confidence interval=1.52-22.85; p=0.010) were risk factors of SBCS.
CONCLUSION: The inability to pass an endoscope and hypoalbuminemia were identified as risk factors of SBCS in patients with cSt II/III ESCC with T3 primary tumor.
