Title: Main pulmonary artery diameter related to pneumonia severity.

Abstract: The diameter (mPAD) of the main pulmonary artery (pulmonary artery trunk) is a crucial indicator for cardiovascular health and prognoses in various conditions. Its enlargement is associated with increased mortality and severity in COVID-19-related pneumonia. However, its relevance to non-COVID pneumonia remains uncertain. The aim of this study was to establish an association between mPAD and the severity of non-COVID pneumonia. Eligible participants with qualified Chest Computed Tomography scans from November 2019 to February 2023 were recruited to a cross-sectional retrospective study. They were stratified into pneumonia and non-pneumonia cohorts. Exclusion criteria included pulmonary hypertension, polytrauma, lung neoplasia, or a history of pulmonary stenosis repair. The mPAD was measured in both groups, and medical records were reviewed to identify comorbidities. Pulmonary CT data were classified by pattern and severity, and the mPAD was measured perpendicularly to the long axis of the artery at the point of bifurcation on an axial slice. Analysis of 380 CT scans (52.6% men, 47.4% women; mean age 52.88 ± 17.58) revealed a significant difference in mPAD between pneumonia and non-pneumonia cases (mean difference: 1.19 mm, 95% CI [0.46, 1.92], p = 0.001). Age correlated positively with mPAD (r = 0.231, 95% CI [0.028, 0.069], p < 0.0001), and this correlation persisted after adjusting for confounders (r = 0.220, 95% CI [0.019, 0.073], p = 0.001). Ordinal logistic regression indicated 1.28 times higher odds of severe pneumonia with a larger diameter. The study highlights associations between mPAD, pneumonia, and severity, suggesting clinical relevance. Furthermore, the mPAD should be carefully considered in defining severity criteria for adverse outcomes in pneumonia patients. Further research is needed to refine clinical criteria on the basis of these findings.
