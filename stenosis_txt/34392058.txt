Title: Possible Markers of Venous Sinus Pressure Elevation in Multiple Sclerosis: Correlations with Gender and Disease Progression.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In a previous study, multiple sclerosis (MS) was found to be associated with an increase in intracranial arterial pulsation volume and a reduction in venous sinus compliance, affecting pulsation dampening. There was a suggestion that the reduction in compliance of the sagittal sinus in MS was caused by an increase in venous pressure, secondary to transverse sinus stenosis. Some differences were noted depending on the gender of the patients, however, the original study was relatively underpowered for further sub-classification. The purpose of the current study is to enroll a larger number of patients to allow sub-classification on gender and disease type to further evaluate the markers of possible venous pressure alteration.
METHODS: 103 patients with MS were prospectively recruited from an MS clinic and compared to 50 matched non-MS patients. Using 3DT1 post contrast images, the sagittal sinus cross-sectional area was measured. The narrowest portion of the transverse sinuses was located and the cross sectional areas and wetted circumferences were measured to calculate the minimum hydraulic and effective diameters. The jugular bulb heights were measured. Voxel wise brain morphometry was performed to evaluate atrophy. Statistical analysis was performed using non-parametric methods and was assessed using α≤0.05.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, the MS patients' sagittal sinuses were 23% larger in cross-section (p<0.0001), the transverse sinuses had an average effective stenosis of 39% by area (p<0.0001) and there was a 62% increase in jugular bulb height (p=0.0001). The MS patients showed a reduction in normalized grey matter volume of 2.8% (p= 0.0001). Males with MS showed worse outcomes compared to females, with an increased EDSS and grey matter loss and had a 23% larger sagittal sinus area (p=0.02), 22% higher jugular bulb height (p=0.03) but a lower transverse sinus stenosis percentage (19% vs 48%, p<0.0001). Progressive forms of MS also had worse outcomes and had a 19% larger sagittal sinus area (p=0.04) compared to relapsing remitting MS.
CONCLUSION: In this larger cohort, worse outcomes in both males and progressive forms of MS were associated with larger sagittal sinuses. The possible cause of the altered sinus pressure in females was narrower transverse sinuses. In males, higher jugular bulbs may be associated with increased venous sinus pressure.
