Title: Carotid Restenosis Rate After Stenting for Primary Lesions Versus Restenosis After Endarterectomy With Creation of Risk Index.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is an option for carotid restenosis (CR) treatment with favorable outcomes. However, CAS has also emerged as an alternative to carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for the management of patients with primary carotid stenosis. This study aimed to report CR rates after CAS was performed in patients with primary lesions versus restenosis after CEA, to identify predictors of CR, and to report both neurological and overall outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2000 to September 2018, a total of 782 patients were divided into 2 groups: The CAS (prim) group consisted of 440 patients in whom CAS was performed for primary lesions, and the CAS (res) group consisted of 342 patients with CAS due to restenosis after CEA. Indications for CAS were symptomatic stenosis/restenosis >70% and asymptomatic stenosis/restenosis >85%. A color duplex scan (CDS) of carotid arteries was performed 6 months after CAS, after 1 year, and annually afterward. Follow-up ranged from 12 to 88 months, with a mean follow-up of 34.6±18.0 months.
RESULTS: There were no differences in terms of CR rate between the patients in the CAS (prim) and CAS (res) groups (8.7% vs 7.2%, χ2=0.691, p=0.406). The overall CR rate was 7.9%, whereas significant CR (&gt;70%) rate needing re-intervention was 5.6%, but there was no difference between patients in the CAS (prim) and CAS (res) groups (6.4% vs 4.7%, p=0.351). Six independent predictors for CR were smoking, associated previous myocardial infarction and angina pectoris, plaque morphology, spasm after CAS, the use of FilterWire or Spider Fx cerebral protection devices, and time after stenting. A carotid restenosis risk index (CRRI) was created based on these predictors and ranged from -7 (minimal risk) to +10 (maximum risk); patients with a score &gt;-4 were at increased risk for CR. There were no differences in terms of neurological and overall morbidity and mortality between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in CR rate after CAS between the patients with primary stenosis and restenosis after CEA. A CRRI score >-4 is a criterion for identifying high-risk patients for post-CAS CR that should be tested in future randomized trials.
