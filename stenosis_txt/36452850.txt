Title: Cut Neck, Department of E.N.T in a Tertiary Centre: How We Approach.

Abstract: Cut neck injury needs prolonged hospitalization, high cost care, reduced quality of life and above all death. Proper exploration is a must in preventing co-morbidities like shock, sepsis, laryngotracheal stenosis or fistula formation. Neck trauma can involve muscles, vessels, nerves, bone and hollow viscera. Though the repair of neck means planning and skill for repair of the structure, the tracheal repair needs special attention to avoid tracheal stenosis. 12 patients were included in the prospective study of 8Â months. Management plan was undertaken which were thoroughly studied and discussed with respect to two tracheoplasty cases done in ENT OT, AMCH. Apart from haemodynamic stability all patients were assessed for injury to hollow viscera and planned accordingly as this centre is an important centre for airway reconstruction. Male female ratio was 11:1. Suicidal cut neck injury was the most common cause. Two cases were of tracheal stenosis post tracheostomy. One of the case had associated neurovascular injury but with patent airway. Rest of the cases were repaired under general and/or local anaesthesia. Primary aim should be to maintain airway and to look for the extent of injury to reduce morbidity. Expertise of surgeons' skill is developing every day hence the successfulness of repair will be tested by least of morbidity. From this institute which is skilled in airway reconstruction we could comment that airway reconstruction team should be an integral part of surgeons' team.
