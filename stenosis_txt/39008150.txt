Title: Systematic review and meta-analysis of current evidences in endograft therapy vs. medical treatment for Spontaneous Isolated Superior Mesenteric Artery Dissection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endovascular stent therapy (EST) for spontaneous isolated superior mesenteric artery dissection (SISMAD) is gaining popularity, yet the treatment strategy - BMT or EST - remains debatable.
METHODS: A meta-analysis examined all randomized trials and observational studies exploring the relative merits and potential risks of EST vs. BMT in treating SISMAD patients. Key outcomes included early and long-term adverse effects, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated. A random- or fixed-effects model was selected according to a 50% heterogeneity threshold.
RESULTS: 9 observational studies involving a total of 672 SISMAD patients (303 EST), met our selection criteria. We discovered no noteworthy distinctions between the EST group and the BMT group in terms of early symptoms' alleviation, reinterventions, or all-cause mortality. However, patients receiving EST management will be hospitalized longer than those receiving BMT (EST: 13.2 ± 5.1 months vs. BMT: 7.0 ± 2.2 months, P &lt; 0.01). In the long run, EST was found to significantly contribute to a higher rate of complete remodeling (OR: 4.53, CI: 3.01 ~ 6.81, P &lt; 0.01; heterogeneity, I2 = 50%) and a lower incidence of aneurysm formation (OR: 0.19, CI: 0.06 ~ 0.6, P &lt; 0.01; heterogeneity, I2 = 0%) than BMT. However, there are no significant differences between ESTand BMTin terms of all-cause mortality, recurrent syndrome, reintervention, and SMA stenosis or occlusion.
CONCLUSION: EST can effectively prevent the formation of aneurysmal dissection and improve SISMAD remodeling. Both EST and BMT are similar in reducing long-term mortality, recurrent symptoms, severe SMA stenosis or occlusion, and the need for reintervention in patients with SISMAD.
