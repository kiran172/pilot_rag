Title: Establishment and Evaluation of a Porcine Vein Graft Disease Model.

Abstract: Venous graft disease (VGD) is the leading cause of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) failure. Large animal models of CABG-VGD are needed for the investigation of disease mechanisms and the development of therapeutic strategies. To perform the surgery, we enter the cardiac chamber through the third intercostal space and carefully dissect the internal mammary vein and immerse it in normal saline. The right main coronary artery is then treated for ischemia. The target vessel is incised, a shunt plug is placed, and the distal end of the graft vein is anastomosed. The ascending aorta is partially blocked, and the proximal end of the graft vein is anastomosed after perforation. The graft vein is checked for patency, and the proximal right coronary artery is ligated. CABG surgery is performed in minipigs to harvest the left internal mammary vein for its use as a vascular graft. Serum biochemical tests are used to evaluate the physiological status of the animals after surgery. Ultrasound examination shows that the proximal, middle, and distal end of the graft vessel are unobstructed. In the surgical model, turbulent blood flow in the graft is observed upon histological examination after the CABG surgery, and venous graft stenosis associated with intimal hyperplasia is observed in the graft. The study here provides detailed surgical procedures for the establishment of a repeatable CABG-induced VGD model.
