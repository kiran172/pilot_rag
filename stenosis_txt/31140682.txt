Title: Fracture of small Mitroflow® aortic bioprosthesis following valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement with ACURATE neo valve-From bench testing to clinical practice.

Abstract: Valve-in-valve (ViV) transcatheter procedures have emerged as a feasible, less-invasive treatment option for bioprosthetic structural valve deterioration. However, in the presence of a small bioprosthesis, a significant residual gradient after ViV procedures often occurs and has been associated with poorer clinical outcomes. We report the use of the self-expandable supra-annular ACURATE neo™ valve to treat degenerated Mitroflow (Sorin) aortic bioprosthesis with severe residual elevated gradients followed by valve fracture with a postdilation using a noncompliant balloon leading to significant reduction in residual gradients. In conclusion, the use of ACURATE neo™ valve followed by the controlled fracture of the surgical bioprosthesis frame with a noncompliant balloon is a safe and effective approach for patients with Mitroflow® failing valves and residual elevated gradient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
