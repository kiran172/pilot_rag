Title: Ultrasound shear wave elastography in pediatric stricturing small bowel Crohn disease: correlation with histology and second harmonic imaging microscopy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Preclinical animal as well as small exploratory ex vivo and in vivo human studies have suggested that bowel wall shear wave speed (SWS) measurements may be a noninvasive biomarker of intestinal damage.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationships between bowel wall stiffness, measured using ultrasound shear wave elastography (SWE), and intestinal fibrosis and smooth muscle hypertrophy as determined by (1) histology and (2) second harmonic imaging microscopy (SHIM) in surgically resected ileal strictures from pediatric Crohn disease patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nineteen pediatric Crohn disease patients with symptomatic ileal strictures underwent research ultrasound examinations before surgical resection between December 2017 and September 2020. Two-dimensional SWE was performed through the area of the most severe stenosis, with measurements obtained from the bowel wall at the 9:00, 12:00 and 3:00 o'clock locations with 0%, 10% and 20% abdominal strain. Overall right lower quadrant stiffness also was documented. Median bowel wall and overall right lower quadrant SWS measurements were correlated with bowel wall histological scores of inflammation, fibrosis and smooth muscle proliferation as well as SHIM collagen signal.
RESULTS: Diagnostic ultrasound SWE imaging was obtained from 18 participants. The median age was 16.8 years. There were negative correlations between histological mucosal active inflammation and both bowel wall SWS with 10% abdominal strain (r=-0.50, P = 0.04) and overall right lower quadrant SWS with 20% abdominal strain (r=-0.69, P = 0.002). There were positive correlations between histological muscularis propria inner layer smooth muscle hypertrophy and both median bowel wall SWS with 10% abdominal strain (r = 0.72, P = 0.002) and overall right lower quadrant SWS with 20% abdominal strain (r = 0.71, P = 0.002). There were no associations between ultrasound stiffness metrics and bowel wall SHIM collagen measurements.
CONCLUSION: Bowel wall and overall right lower quadrant ultrasound stiffness measurements correlate with mucosal active inflammation and muscularis propria smooth muscle hypertrophy in pediatric stricturing ileal Crohn disease, but not with intestinal fibrosis.
