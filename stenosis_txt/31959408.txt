Title: Presentation and management of calcific mitral valve disease.

Abstract: Little is known about the prevalence, presentation and management of calcific mitral valve disease (CMVD). We identified 167 patients (80 ± 10 years; 79% women) with significant CMVD undergoing transthoracic echocardiography at our institution in 2016. Patients presented with significant co-morbidities, 47% had moderate/severe mitral stenosis, 38% had 3+/4+ mitral regurgitation and 15% had a combination of both. Fifty-eight percent were symptomatic. Most symptomatic patients were managed conservatively and incurred higher mortality and mortality/heart failure admission rates than those managed surgically. These data highlight the importance of gaining mechanistic insights into CMVD to prevent its occurrence and avoid the need for high-risk surgery, which is seldom performed in contemporary practice.
