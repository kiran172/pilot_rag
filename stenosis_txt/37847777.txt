Title: Safety and efficacy of braided stents as stent monotherapy for the treatment of small intracranial aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The safety and efficacy of low-profile braided stent as stent monotherapy require further investigation.
OBJECTIVE: To analyze patient outcomes after treatment with braided stents used as "light" flow diverters.
MATERIAL/METHODS: Retrospective study to evaluate the occlusion rate of aneurysms treated with braided stent and remodeling of covered side branches and perforators. Several factors potentially influencing aneurysm occlusion were analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-five aneurysms in 31 patients were included. Six aneurysms (17.1%) had an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage. Braided stent was used as retreatment among 9 previously coiled aneurysms (25.7%). A total occlusion was achieved in 18 aneurysms (51.4%), entry remnant in 3 aneurysms (8.6%), incomplete filling in 6 aneurysms (17.1%) and complete filling in 8 aneurysms (22.9%). None of the aneurysms ruptured during the follow-up period. Of 32 stents deployed, we observed 3 cases (9.4%) of asymptomatic mild stenosis and 3 cases (10.7%) of narrowing of covered branches among 28 covered arteries. There were no cases of perforator infarction and no mortality or permanent morbidity associated with the treatment. Moreover, aneurysms <2.5 mm, aneurysms with a neck <1.8 mm, those with a mean aspect-ratio of 1.4, and lateral wall aneurysms had a higher frequency of adequate occlusion.
CONCLUSION: Braided stents used as stent monotherapy appear to be sufficiently effective in the treatment of very small intracranial aneurysms, despite a lower overall occlusion rate compared to a standard flow diversion strategy. However, given the low morbidity rate, this strategy may be an alternative to flow-diverter stents for small and distally located lesions.
