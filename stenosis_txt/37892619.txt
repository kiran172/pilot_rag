Title: Radial Artery Deviation and Reimplantation (RADAR) to Accelerate the Maturation of Radial-Cephalic Fistulas for Hemodialysis in Patients with End-Stage Renal Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The most common form of vascular access for hemodialysis is a native arteriovenous fistula, which connects the site of the artery to the end of the vein. The maturation process of the fistula plays a crucial role in the establishment of a functional vascular access. Radial artery stenosis is among the potential causes of maturation failure. In these cases, improving the fistula's blood flow may be difficult, as traditional surgical reanastomosis and endovascular intervention frequently fail. Radial artery deviation and reimplantation (RADAR) is a novel and effective technique for creating primary fistulas with a high patency rate. The main disadvantage of this procedure is the ligation of the radial artery and the subsequent known consequences.
METHODS: To accelerate maturation, we used RADAR as a secondary approach in three patients with radial artery stenosis and maturation failure.
RESULTS: In all patients after surgery, we observed a significant increase in fistula blood flow. Two patients used fistulas for hemodialysis after surgery. We describe the image diagnosis, procedure, and benefits of this method.
CONCLUSIONS: The RADAR technique may be successfully used as a secondary access in patients with maturation failure due to RA stenosis to accelerate fistula maturation.
