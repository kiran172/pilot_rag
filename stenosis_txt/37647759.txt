Title: Surgical management of a transverse vaginal septum: About a rare case.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The transverse vaginal septum is a rare anomaly of the müllerian ducts whose pathophysiology is linked to a defect in the resorption of the embryological tissue located between the vaginal dome and the caudal terminal part of the fused müllerian ducts.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a rare case of a permeable transverse vaginal septum in a 41-year-old patient, who consulted for cyclic pelvic pain.
DISCUSSION: The vaginal septum is a rare anomaly of the Müllerian ducts whose approximate frequency is around 1/70,000 women. The vaginal septum can be permeable or impermeable and can affect all levels of the vagina. The combination of conventional ultrasound and MRI confirms the diagnosis of these abnormalities. The treatment is surgical and must be implemented quickly. Several surgical techniques have been described, the simplest of which is the "crevice" technique.
CONCLUSION: The combination of conventional ultrasound and MRI is useful in confirming the diagnosis of these abnormalities. Surgical treatment should always be well planned. The risks of postoperative stenosis and the impact on the upper genital tract must be taken into account.
