Title: Echocardiographic L-wave as a prognostic indicator in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: This study applies L-wave measurements of mid-diastolic trans-mitral flow. Although considered to be a marker of elevated filling pressure or delayed myocardial relaxation, its clinical and prognostic value is yet to be completely elucidated. It has been shown that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) induces reverse remodeling and improves diastolic function and prognosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). Our purpose was to evaluate the prognostic value of L-wave following TAVR. We examined clinical and echocardiographic data of patients undergoing TAVR. L-Wave presence and velocity were recorded at baseline and at 1 month and 6 months following TAVR. The effect of the procedure on L-wave measurements and its impact on mortality and other clinical outcomes were analyzed. A total of 502 patients (mean age 82.58 ± 5.9) undergoing TAVR were included. Patients with baseline L-wave (n = 68, 12%) had a smaller stroke volume index by 5.7 ± 2.3 ml/m2 (p = 0.01) as compared to patients without L-wave at baseline. L-waves disappeared In 35% and 70% of patients at 1 month and at 6 months respectively. Baseline L-wave velocity was 34.8 ± 11.5 (cm/s) and decreased significantly at follow-up examinations. Patients with persistent L-wave following TAVR had higher 3-year adjusted mortality rates (HR 5.7, 95% CI 3.7-8.9, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis of survival was also statistically significant (p &lt; 0.001). TAVR induces L-wave disappearance and a decrease in L-wave velocity in patients with severe AS. L-wave persistence following TAVR is an independent risk factor for mortality.
