Title: Microembolic Signals in Arteries of the Base of the Brain after Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: Embolic strokes make up a significant proportion of acute cerebrovascular accidents. Doppler blood flow monitoring with microembolodetection allows suggesting the embolic nature of cerebral infarction. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with the presence of microembolic signals in patients with ischemic stroke. The study included 515 patients, microembolic signals were detected in 48 (9.3%) of them. According to multispiral CT angiography, significant differences in patients with and without microembolic signals were found for wall thickness of both common carotid arteries and for left internal carotid artery (p<0.05). Factor analysis revealed a variable that reflects the severity of left carotid arteries atherosclerosis, which was a significant predictor of registration of the microembolic signals (p=0.016).
