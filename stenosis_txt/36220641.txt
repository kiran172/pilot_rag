Title: Dacryoendoscopic Findings of Patients with Lacrimal Drainage Obstruction Associated with Cancer Treatment.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the diagnosis and treatment outcome of lacrimal drainage obstruction of patients who underwent systemic chemotherapy (CTx) or radioactive iodine treatment (RAI) by using dacryoendoscopy and at the same time performing dacryoendoscopy-guided silicone tube insertion (STI) to treat epiphora.
METHODS: From July 2017 to December 2020, the medical records of 11 patients (16 eyes) were diagnosed with lacrimal drainage obstruction after CTx or RAI and underwent dacryoendoscopy-guided STI were reviewed retrospectively. We tried to count the number of obstructive sites in total patients using slit-lamp examination and dacryoendoscopic findings.
RESULTS: A total of 11 patients, 16 eyes, were enrolled in this study. The onset of epiphora in the CTx group (3.0 ± 4.0 months) was significantly shorter than that in the RAI group (52.6 ± 36.5 months, p = 0.001). There were total 32 obstructive sites including 28 obstructive sites of dacryoendoscopic findings and four sites of punctual stenosis in total 16 cases. Using dacryoendoscopy, granulation findings was dominant in RAI patients (p = 0.038) and mucus finding was frequent mostly in lacrimal sac and canaliculus. In the CTx group, mucosal edema finding was dominant (p = 0.038) and fibrotic membrane finding was frequent in all levels of lacrimal drainage system. Regarding the obstructive location, lacrimal sac was the most frequently obstructed site in the two groups (p = 0.038).
CONCLUSIONS: The onset of epiphora in the CTx group was significantly earlier than in the RAI group. In the CTx group, mucosal edema finding was frequent in all levels of lacrimal drainage system. In the RAI group, granulation finding was frequent mostly in lacrimal sac and canaliculus. Since the clinical outcome was satisfactory, intervention with dacryoendoscopy-guided STI could be a treatment of choice in patients with epiphora after CTx or RAI.
