Title: Transcarotid Versus Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (from a Propensity-Matched Comparison).

Abstract: Previous reports comparing transcarotid (TC) versus transfemoral (TF) approaches for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement have had inconsistent conclusions. We compared in-hospital and 1-year clinical outcomes, changes in quality of life, and direct hospital costs for 138 TC versus 1,926 TF procedures. Propensity matching based on the Society of Thoracic Surgery Predicted Risk of Mortality was used to compare 130 patients who underwent TC with 813 patients who underwent TF. Matched TC versus TF cohorts did not differ with respect to in-hospital mortality (0.0% vs 1.4%, p = 0.380), stroke (2.3% vs 2.5%, p = 0.917), major vascular complications (0.8% vs 2.2%, p = 0.268), composite bleeding complications (4.6% vs 6.4%, p = 0.647), requirement for permanent pacemaker (14.6% vs 12.9%, p = 0.426), postoperative hospital length of stay (3.3 ± 3.4 vs 3.1 ± 3.3 days, p = 0.467), or direct hospital costs ($52,899 ± 9,560 vs $50,464 ± 10,997, p = 0.230). Similarly, at 1-year, patients who underwent TC versus patients who underwent TF did not differ with respect to all-cause mortality (7.6% vs 6.4%, p = 0.659), hospital readmission (20.0% vs 23.9%, p = 0.635), or quality of life as measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire score (84.0 ± 17.1 vs 88.4 ± 13.9, p = 0.062). Patients who underwent TC and TF did not differ with respect to in-hospital complications, length of hospital stay, and direct hospital costs, as well as 1-year mortality, readmission, and quality of life. These data add to ongoing support for the TC approach as the optimal alternative access for patients with transcatheter aortic valve replacement deferred from a transfemoral approach.
