Title: Endoscopic Ultrasonography-guided Gastrojejunostomy for Patients with Gastric Outlet Obstruction and Pyloric Metal Stent Dysfunction.

Abstract: A 52-year-old woman with a gastric outlet obstruction (GOO) caused by pyloric cancer underwent pyloric endoscopic self-expandable metal stent (SEMS) insertion. She presented with abdominal distension 40 days later. The SEMS was dysfunctional, and endoscopic ultrasound-guided gastrojejunostomy (EUS-GJ) was performed using an endoscopic nasobiliary drainage tube. A 16 mm×31 mm Niti-S ™ HOT SPAXUS™ (TaeWoong Medical, Gimpo, Korea) was inserted successfully between the stomach and the adjacent jejunum. After the procedure, the patient had a good oral intake for more than seven months. GOO is a mechanical obstructive condition caused by various benign and malignant conditions. Traditionally, surgical GJ and SEMS insertion have been used to treat GOOs. EUS-GJ is a feasible treatment option for patients with GOO and a pyloric metal stent dysfunction.
