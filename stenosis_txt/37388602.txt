Title: An Unusual Cause of Coronary Occlusion During an Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair: Reperfusion With Diagnostic Angiography Only.

Abstract: We present a unique case of a type I peri-operative myocardial infarction during an extensive abdominal aortic aneurysm repair occurring due to the occlusion of a severe stable ostial plaque stenosis by a small overlying thrombus. During coronary angiography, the thrombus was dislodged by the diagnostic catheter which restored normal flow without stent placement. We demonstrate a care approach that was carefully arrived upon through multidisciplinary management with vascular surgery and anesthesiology colleagues.
