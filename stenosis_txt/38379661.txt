Title: Late Migration of a Transcatheter Heart Valve.

Abstract: Migration or embolization of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) prosthesis is an uncommon (usually acute) complication. Associated risk factors include malpositioning, pacing miscapture, undersizing, postdilation, and bicuspid anatomy. Delayed migration is exceedingly rare with little experience reported. The presentation can be catastrophic, requiring emergency surgery. Herein, we present a case of late TAVR migration managed with repeat transfemoral TAVR.
