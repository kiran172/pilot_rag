Title: Turn-to-Shockable Rhythm Has Comparable Neurologic Outcomes to Initial Shockable Rhythm in Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest Patients Who Underwent Targeted Temperature Management.

Abstract: Shockable rhythm in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) implies better outcome and underlying coronary stenosis. We investigated the neurologic outcome and coronary lesions between initial shockable rhythm and turn-to-shockable rhythm. This multicenter, retrospective observational study included adult nontraumatic OHCA survivors with any shockable rhythm during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) who underwent targeted temperature management between January 2010 and December 2016. Patients were divided into two groups according to the first monitored rhythm: initial shockable rhythm or turn-to-shockable rhythm. The primary outcome was good neurologic outcome at discharge based on cerebral performance categories, and the secondary outcomes were survival discharge, recurrent arrest, and coronary lesions. The two groups were matched in a 1:1 ratio using propensity score (PS). Of 426 patients, 137 and 289 patients were divided into the turn-to-shockable and initial shockable rhythm groups, respectively. Overall, 224 (52.6%) patients had good neurologic outcomes. The turn-to-shockable rhythm group had less patients with good neurologic outcome (57/137 vs. 167/289; p = 0.002) and less culprit lesions in the left anterior descending and left circumflex arteries. However, survival discharge and recurrent arrest were not different between the two groups, and the turn-to-shockable rhythm had no independent association with neurologic outcome (odds ratio, 1.874; 95% confidence interval, 0.909-3.863). In the PS-matched cohort, the turn-to-shockable rhythm group had similar good neurologic outcome (47/100 vs. 35/100, p = 0.083). Survival discharge, recurrent arrest, and coronary culprit lesions were not different between the two groups. In this PS-matched study, OHCA with any shockable rhythm during CPR had similar neurologic outcome and coronary culprit lesions, irrespective of the first monitored rhythm.
