Title: Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valves and moderate aortic stenosis in heart failure: New indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) remains one of the most common valvular heart diseases, with enormous impact on patient survival. Over the past years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a reality worldwide, offering a less invasive method to treat AS. Apart from the classical indications for aortic valve disease, recent studies tried to address unanswered questions for TAVI - asymptomatic severe AS, bicuspid aortic valves and moderate AS in patients with heart failure. This review discusses the rationale of those possible indications, pitfalls and current evidence in the medical literature.
