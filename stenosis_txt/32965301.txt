Title: Stents in the femoropopliteal territory: prevalence of fractures and their consequences.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endovascular treatment for femoropopliteal arterial disease has made revascularization procedures less invasive, but the self-expanding stents used can suffer great wear in arteries with extreme mobility. To evaluate the prevalence of fractures in stents implanted in the femoropopliteal segment, to identify predisposing factors and consequences on arterial patency.
METHOD: between March and June 2019, thirty patients previously operated for femoropopliteal obstruction underwent stent X-rays in anteroposterior and lateral views to detect fractures and Doppler to analyze arterial patency.
RESULTS: we observed 12 cases with fractures (33.3%): 1 type I (2.8%), 3 type II (8.3%), 5 type III (13.9%), 3 type IV (8.3%) and no type V. According to the TASC II we had 1 in group B (8.3%), 6 in group C (50%) and 5 in group D (41.6%) p <0.004. The number of stents per limb was 3.1 (± 1.3) in cases of fracture versus 2.3 (± 1.3) in cases without fracture (p = 0.08). The extension was 274.17mm (± 100.94) in cases of fracture and 230.83mm (± 135.44) in cases without fracture (p = 0.29). On Doppler we had: 17 patients (47.2%) without stenosis, 9 patients (25%) with stenosis> 50% and 10 patients (27.8%) with occlusion (p = 0.37). There was no correlation between fracture and arterial obstruction (p = 0.33).
CONCLUSION: stent fractures are a frequent finding in the femoropopliteal area (33.3%), being more prevalent in cases of more advanced disease (C and D). There was no association between the finding of fracture and arterial obstruction.
