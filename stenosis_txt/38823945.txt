Title: ACR Appropriateness Criteria® Cerebrovascular Diseases-Stroke and Stroke-Related Conditions.

Abstract: Cerebrovascular disease encompasses a vast array of conditions. The imaging recommendations for stroke-related conditions involving noninflammatory steno-occlusive arterial and venous cerebrovascular disease including carotid stenosis, carotid dissection, intracranial large vessel occlusion, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are encompassed by this document. Additional imaging recommendations regarding complications of these conditions including intraparenchymal hemorrhage and completed ischemic strokes are also discussed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.
