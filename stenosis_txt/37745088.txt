Title: A unique case of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction with abnormal origin of left coronary system from the right coronary cusp.

Abstract: A unique case of non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctionis discussed, in which the left main coronary artery and anomalous coronary artery from the opposite sinus of Valsalva were absent. In this case, the left coronary cusp was blunted, and all three coronary arteries trifurcated from a single ostium in the right coronary cusp. The proximal part of the left anterior descending coronary artery had a trans-septal (intermuscular) course, while the left circumflex coronary artery had a retro-aortic course and severe thrombotic stenosis before the terminal portion. Due to the patient's refusal of coronary artery bypass graft, percutaneous coronary intervention was performed.
