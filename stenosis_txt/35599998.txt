Title: A case of post-operative stenosis caused by colonic ischemia after low anterior resection for rectal cancer, followed by delayed colo-anal anastomosis.

Abstract: Cases of delayed colo-anal anastomosis (DCAA) are currently reported instead of the colo-anal anastomosis with a protective loop ileostomy for rectal cancer. Post-operative colonic ischemia is considered as one of the serious complications of colorectal resection. Although indication of DCAA should be carefully selected, we experienced a case of post-operative stenosis caused by colonic ischemia after low anterior resection for rectal cancer, followed by this procedure.
