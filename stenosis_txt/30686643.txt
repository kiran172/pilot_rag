Title: Outcomes of Double-patch and Warden Techniques in Patients With Supracardiac Partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection.

Abstract: AIM: This study compared outcomes following the double-patch and Warden procedures for correcting partial anomalous connection of the right pulmonary veins to the superior vena cava.
METHODS: Eighty (80) patients, aged <18years old, and with partial anomalous connection of the right pulmonary veins to the superior vena cava were randomly assigned into double-patch method (n=40) and Warden procedure (n=40) groups. The median follow-up was 22.5 (range, 12-39) months. The primary endpoint was sinus node dysfunction at the mid-term follow-up period.
RESULTS: No early or late mortality occurred. In the early postoperative period, sinus node dysfunction was observed in 27.5% and 5% of cases after double-patch correction and the Warden procedure, respectively (risk ratio, 5.50; 95% confidence interval, 1.30-23.25; p=0.01). At follow-up, sinus node dysfunction persisted in two (5%) patients after double-patch correction. All patients had normal sinus rhythm after the Warden procedure. No early or late pacemaker implantation occurred in either group. No patients had significant pulmonary veins or superior vena cava stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The double-patch technique and Warden procedure both showed excellent early and mid-term results with no mortality and minimal morbidity. The Warden procedure was associated with less sinus node dysfunction in the early postoperative period than the double-patch technique. There was no significant between-group difference in sinus node dysfunction at the mid-term follow-up.
