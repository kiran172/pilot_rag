Title: Perspectives on Heyde's Syndrome and Calcific Aortic Valve Disease.

Abstract: Heyde's syndrome is a multisystem disorder describing the association between calcified aortic stenosis, gastrointestinal tract bleeding from arteriovenous malformations, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome. Several studies have reported an increase in prevalence of gastrointestinal arteriovenous malformation in patients with aortic stenosis and vice versa; however, the incidence of Heyde's syndrome remains controversial. In general, the syndrome is prevalent in the elderly population. The pathogenesis and management remain controversial as well. Our review, provides a unique case to highlight the diagnosis and management of Heyde's syndrome while also briefly describing the prevalence, etiology, diagnosis, and management of calcific aortic valve disease in general.
