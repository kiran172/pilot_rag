Title: Wellens Syndrome without chest pain, is it possible?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Wellens syndrome is a typical electrocardiographic and clinical pattern that correlates with a severe proximal stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD). It is associated with previous angina, no or slightly increased cardiac markers, and two ECG patterns: diphasic T wave in V2-V3 (Type A) or deep negative T waves from V1 to V4 (type B). In this paper, we described two cases with asymptomatic Wellens patterns.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe two cases of Wellens syndrome ECG pattern that we observed in our Emergency Department not accompanied by chest pain or angina equivalents.
RESULTS: Both patients presented significant stenosis of LAD at the coronary angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic patients presenting with Wellens ECG pattern should perform a coronary arteriography cause of the risk of a severe LAD stenosis. We need further studies to confirm if all "silent" Wellens syndromes deserve angiographic study.
