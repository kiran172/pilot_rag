Title: Biomedical application of materials for external auditory canal: History, challenges, and clinical prospects.

Abstract: Biomaterials play an integral role in treatment of external auditory canal (EAC) diseases. Regarding the special anatomic structure and physiological characteristics of EAC, careful selection of applicable biomaterials was essential step towards effective management of EAC conditions. The bioactive materials can provide reasonable biocompatibility, reduce risk of host pro-inflammatory response and immune rejection, and promote the healing process. In therapeutic procedure, biomaterials were employed for covering or packing the wound, protection of the damaged tissue, and maintaining of normal structures and functions of the EAC. Therefore, understanding and application of biomaterials was key to obtaining great rehabilitation in therapy of EAC diseases. In clinical practice, biomaterials were recognized as an important part in the treatment of different EAC diseases. The choice of biomaterials was distinct according to the requirements of various diseases. As a result, awareness of property regarding different biomaterials was fundamental for appropriate selection of therapeutic substances in different EAC diseases. In this review, we firstly introduced the characteristics of EAC structures and physiology, and EAC pathologies were summarized secondarily. From the viewpoint of biomaterials, the different materials applied to individual diseases were outlined in categories. Besides, the underlying future of therapeutic EAC biomaterials was discussed.
