Title: Balloon Fracture During TAVR: Effective and Repeatable Technique Not Written in the Textbook.

Abstract: An 88-year-old man was referred to transcatheter aortic valve replacement for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Edwards 26-mm Sapien bioprosthetic valve (Sapien) implantation was planned after accurate computed tomography-based procedure planning. When the valve was released, the inflation pressure decreased rapidly due to the balloon bursting. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
