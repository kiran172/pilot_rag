Title: Robotic Revision of Hepaticojejunostomy for Benign Biliary Stricture.

Abstract: Surgical revision of biliary enteric anastomoses (BEA) can be a challenging undertaking and a robotic platform may provide advantages that address many of the technical obstacles. We present our technical approach and outcomes for patients undergoing robotic revision of BEA for benign strictures. A retrospective review was performed for robot-assisted benign BEA revision at our institution. Operative details, perioperative metrics, and outcomes are reported. Four patients underwent anastomotic revision following previously failed non-operative management. There were no intraoperative complications, mean length of stay was 4-days, and all patients experienced resolution of presenting clinical signs and symptoms. No patients required reoperation and there was no mortality. Postoperative outcomes were consistent with findings reported for other interventional modalities. Based on our experience we conclude robotic intervention in this context is safe and improves the technical feasibility of this complex procedure.
