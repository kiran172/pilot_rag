Title: A heart valve dedicated for aortic regurgitation: Review of technology and early clinical experience with the transfemoral Trilogy system.

Abstract: Aortic regurgitation (AR) is associated with morbidity and premature mortality. Surgical aortic valve replacement is not an option for many patients due to an adverse surgical risk profile, whilst transcatheter aortic valve implantation with most available prostheses has demonstrated suboptimal implantation success and outcomes. The JenaValve Trilogyâ„¢ system provides an attractive solution for such patients as it utilizes clips that directly attach onto the native valve leaflets to anchor. Initially designed for transapical delivery, the current transfemoral delivery system is under investigation in the United States and approved for aortic stenosis and regurgitation in Europe. We present an expert review on the technical aspects of the Trilogy system, provide a guide for implantation, discuss the available evidence for the technology and provide illustrative case examples.
