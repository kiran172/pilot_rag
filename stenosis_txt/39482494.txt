Title: Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome and bilateral Eagle Syndrome cause recurrent reversible carotid artery stenosis and cerebral infarction.

Abstract: A middle-aged male who has experienced recurrent, reversible carotid artery stenosis and cerebral infarction over the past decade. Recurrent cerebral infarction is highly prevalent in clinical practice, with an accurate diagnosis of the cause of the disease being crucial. However, the patient is suffering from three diseases that may be involved in the recurrent cerebral infarction, including Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS), Bilateral Eagle Syndrome, and Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO). Among them, both RCVS and Bilateral Eagle Syndrome can lead to recurrent stenosis of the carotid arteries. But the coexistence of these diseases is extremely rare. The symptoms of patients are not typical, and the coexistence of all the three diseases makes it a challenging diagnostic dilemma. This article presents a diagnostic approach to differentiate these possible diseases, thereby enhancing readers' ability to diagnose such situations.
