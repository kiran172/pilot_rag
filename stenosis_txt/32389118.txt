Title: COX and PTGDS Gene Expression Levels in PGD2 Synthesis Pathway are Correlated with miR-520 in Patients with Vessel Restenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The vessel restenosis is related to the inflammatory events in subendothelial space. It is proposed that the inflammatory agents affect the prostaglandin synthesis pathway. In this study, we investigated the COX-1, COX-2, PTGDS and miRNA-520a-5p expression levels and the serum 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 metabolite values in patients with the stenosed and re-stenosed vessels. Furthermore, the associations between genes and miR-520 were evaluated in the monocyte transfection studies.
METHODS: The subjects (n=60) were included three groups; healthy subjects (control (stenosis &lt; 5%), stent no restenosis (SNR, restenosis &lt; 5%) and in-stent restenosis (ISR, restenosis &gt; 70%)). The miRNA and gene expression levels were measured by RT-qPCR technique. 15-Deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 values were measured by the ELISA technique. The miR-520 was transfected into myocytes using PEI polymer.
RESULTS: The monocyte COX-1, COX-2 and PTGDS gene expression levels and the serum 15-Deoxy- Δ12,14-PGJ2 values increased significantly in the patients. Furthermore, the miR-520 correlated conversely with the COX-1, and PTGDS gene expression levels.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that the PGD2 synthesis pathway is active in the patients and, miR- 520 may be involved in the function of this pathway.
