Title: [Cardiac amyloidosis and aortic valve stenosis].

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis in old age has become a topic of interest for cardiology and cardiac surgery after the development of transvascular and transluminal minimally invasive techniques for aortic valve implantation. The observation of amyloid deposits in surgically excised valvular material led to the diagnostics of amyloidosis of the myocardium, which was discovered in up to 20% of the patients who underwent valve implantation. Clinical signs of cardiac amyloidosis, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and ruptured distal biceps tendon should be taken into account. In addition to the electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram and magnetic resonance imaging, 99mtechnetium bone scintigraphy plays a key diagnostic role. The simultaneous occurrence of severe aortic valve stenosis and amyloidosis explains the special hemodynamic situation of a low gradient with low blood flow in high-grade valve stenosis. The interventional or surgical valve implantation improves the prognosis for these patients, similarly to aortic valve stenosis alone, followed by a specific pharmaceutical treatment depending on the type of amyloidosis.
