Title: Gangrene of the Foot After Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery.

Abstract: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is the most common surgery performed by cardiothoracic surgeons worldwide. Risks of CABG include neurological outcomes, deep vein thrombosis, renal or gastrointestinal injury, and death. Perioperatively, some patients may need intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) use to help assist with cardiac function. In this case, a 75-year-old man presented with multivessel myocardial infarction requiring IABP for cardiac assistance prior to undergoing CABG. Eighteen days after his CABG, his toes turned black at home. A CT angiogram showed aortic atherosclerosis, right tibioperoneal trunk stenosis, mild atherosclerotic right proximal anterior tibial artery stenosis, and multifocal occlusive lesions in the right and left infrapopliteal vessels. Vascular surgery performed balloon angioplasty of the right anterior tibial artery and podiatry performed a transmetatarsal amputation of the dry gangrene. The aim of this case report is to present a rare complication of CABG with peri-operative IABP use and to highlight the need for prompt diagnosis and treatment of dry gangrene.
