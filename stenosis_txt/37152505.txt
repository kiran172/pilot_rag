Title: Unusual large mass on aortic valve in an infant.

Abstract: Mass on the aortic valve is extremely rare in children, and the differential diagnosis includes vegetation, thrombus, and primary cardiac tumors. A rise in infective endocarditis in infants is seen due to increasing survival of children with congenital heart diseases and sick newborn infants with prolonged hospitalization. We report a 4-month-old infant born prematurely with early-onset sepsis requiring prolonged antibiotic treatment and valvular aortic stenosis presenting with sudden hemodynamic compromise due to aortic vegetation extending into the ascending aorta eroding through its posterior wall. The report details management of our case and a brief description of available alternative treatment strategies.
