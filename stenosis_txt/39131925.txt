Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy vs Atherectomy in the Treatment of Calcified Common Femoral Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Common femoral artery (CFA) disease is often heavily calcified and prone to low patency rates with endovascular treatment compared with surgical endarterectomy. Recent data suggest promising short-term outcomes with the adjunct use of intravascular lithotripsy; however, data on its midterm effectiveness are lacking. We compared clinically driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) between patients receiving drug-coated balloon angioplasty with adjunct intravascular lithotripsy (IVL-DCB) vs adjunct atherectomy (Ath-DCB) for treatment of CFA disease.
METHODS: In a single-center retrospective cohort study, patients receiving IVL-DCB vs Ath-DCB for symptomatic CFA disease from January 2015 to March 2020 were included. The primary outcome was cumulative CD-TLR with angiographic restenosis â‰¥50%, estimated by Kaplan-Meier analysis during 18-month follow-up and compared by log-rank test.
RESULTS: Total of 68 CFA lesions (Ath-DCB, 35; IVL-DCB, 33) were included. Patients had a mean age (standard deviation) of 72 (8) years and were predominantly male (63.3%) and White (92%). Mean baseline angiographic stenosis was 78% (11) in the Ath-DCB group and 70% (10) in the IVL-DCB group (P = .002). Technical success was 100% in both groups. One flow-limiting dissection occurred in IVL-DCB requiring stent placement, whereas 2 bailout stentings were performed in the Ath-DCB group. Cumulative Kaplan-Meier freedom from CD-TLR was 91.2% (95% CI, 81.6%-100%) in the Ath-DCB group vs 79.4% (95% CI, 64.6%-94.2%) in the IVL-DCB group (Log-rank P = .167).
CONCLUSIONS: The safety and effectiveness of IVL-DCB were comparable to those of Ath-DCB in the treatment of calcified CFA disease during the 18-month follow-up. Further studies are required to verify these findings.
