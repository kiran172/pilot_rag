Title: Revision Bariatric Procedures and Management of Complications from Bariatric Surgery.

Abstract: Bariatric surgery is effective, but may be associated with adverse events. A multi-disciplinary approach including endoscopic interventions can be effective to manage these. Endoscopists should familiarize themselves with gastrointestinal pathology which can occur after bariatric surgery, including nutritional deficiencies, acid reflux, anastomotic stenosis, gallstone disease, leaks, fistulas, and weight regain. Endoscopic interventions including anastomotic stricture dilation, control of bleeding, endoscopic ultrasound-guided approach for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, leak or fistula closure via endoscopic suturing or stent placement, and transoral outlet reduction (TORe) or revision obesity surgery endoluminal (ROSE) to address weight regain are among the endoscopic tools which have demonstrated safety and efficacy in the management of adverse events after bariatric surgery.
