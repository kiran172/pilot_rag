Title: Early First-Generation Trifecta Valve Failure: A Case Series and a Review of the Literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Trifecta valve (Abbott, St Paul, MN) has excellent hemodynamic performance with acceptable rates of freedom from structural valve degeneration. However, some recent studies have reported early Trifecta valve failure. Here, we report a case series of seven Trifecta valve failures with a review of the literature.
METHODS: Of 107 implantations of Trifecta bioprostheses between 2012 and 2014, we encountered seven Trifecta valve failures (6.5%). Failure of a 19-mm Trifecta valve occurred in 1 patient, failure of a 21-mm Trifecta valve occurred in 5 patients, and failure of a 23-mm Trifecta valve occurred in 1 patient. The mean duration of valve durability was 51 ± 16 months. The mean effective orifice area index on the first echocardiogram after Trifecta valve implantation was 0.96 ± 0.26. The mode of presentation was prosthetic valve stenosis in 3 patients and severe aortic regurgitation in 4 patients.
RESULTS: Six patients underwent redo surgical aortic valve replacement. The common pathologic findings were circumferential pannus formation with noncoronary cusp tear and leaflet calcification. The rates of preoperative end-renal stage disease and postoperative prosthesis-patient mismatch were higher in patients with Trifecta valve failure. The incidence of early Trifecta valve failure was 3.1% at 48 months and 13.1% at 72 months.
CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, early Trifecta valve failure was caused by cusp tears or leaflet calcification. Patients with end-renal stage disease and prosthesis-patient mismatch should be closely followed. Some patients with cusp tears may require urgent surgery.
