Title: In vivo exclusion of giant aortic thrombus: Transesophageal echocardiography in thoracic endovascular aortic repair: A case report: Transesophageal echocardiography in thoracic endovascular aortic repair: A case report.

Abstract: We present the case of a 53-year-old patient with a giant floating thrombus in the aortic arch associated with proximal stenosis of the left subclavian artery diagnosed by multimodal imaging. Left carotid-subclavian shunt and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) were successful. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) played a substantial role in the safety and efficacy of the endovascular procedure and should be considered as an additional guide to fluoroscopy for this type of procedure.
