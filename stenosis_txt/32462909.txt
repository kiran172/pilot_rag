Title: Osteopontin as novel biomarker for reversibility of pressure overload induced left ventricular hypertrophy.

Abstract: Aim: The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of osteopontin (OPN) as a marker for left ventricular (LV)Â hypertrophy and its reversibility after surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Patients &amp; methods: Echocardiographic data and OPN plasma levels of 149 consecutive patients undergoing SAVR were obtained preoperatively and 3 months postoperatively. OPN was measured by Quantikine Human OPN immunoassay. Results: There was a significant correlation between higher OPN plasma levels and lower LV-mass regression. In patients receiving SAVR combined with coronary artery bypass grafting, high OPN plasma levels were also an indicator for eccentric hypertrophy phenotype. Conclusion: OPN may be a useful indicator for LV hypertrophy phenotype and could have a prognostic value to estimate LV-mass regression after SAVR.
