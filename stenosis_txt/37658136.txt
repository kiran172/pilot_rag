Title: Impact of vessel morphology on CT-derived fractional-flow-reserve in non-obstructive coronary artery disease in right coronary artery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) decreases continuously from proximal to distal segments of the vessel due to the influence of various factors even in non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD). It is known that FFR<sub>CT</sub> is dependent on vessel-length, but the relationship with other vessel morphologies remains to be explained.
PURPOSE: To investigate morphological aspects of the vessels that influence FFR<sub>CT</sub> in NOCAD in the right coronary artery (RCA).
METHODS: A total of 443 patients who underwent both FFR<sub>CT</sub> and invasive coronary angiography, with &lt; 50% RCA stenosis, were evaluated. Enrolled RCA vessels were classified into two groups according to distal FFR<sub>CT</sub>: FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 (n = 60) and FFR<sub>CT</sub> &gt; 0.80 (n = 383). Vessel morphology (vessel length, lumen diameter, lumen volume, and plaque volume) and left-ventricular mass were assessed. The ratio of lumen volume and vessel length was defined as V/L ratio.
RESULTS: Whereas vessel-length was almost the same between FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 and &gt; 0.80, lumen volume and V/L ratio were significantly lower in FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80. Distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> correlated with plaque-related parameters (low-attenuation plaque, intermediate-attenuation plaque, and calcified plaque) and vessel-related parameters (proximal and distal vessel diameter, vessel length, lumen volume, and V/L ratio). Among all vessel-related parameters, V/L ratio showed the highest correlation with distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> (r = 0.61, p &lt; 0.0001). Multivariable analysis showed that calcified plaque volume was the strongest predictor of distal FFR<sub>CT</sub>, followed by V/L ratio (β-coefficient = 0.48, p = 0.03). V/L ratio was the strongest predictor of a distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 (cut-off 8.1 mm3/mm, AUC 0.88, sensitivity 90.0%, specificity 76.7%, 95% CI 0.84-0.93, p &lt; 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that V/L ratio can be a measure to predict subclinical coronary perfusion disturbance.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: A novel marker of the ratio of lumen volume to vessel length (V/L ratio) is the strongest predictor of a distal CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) and may have the potential to improve the diagnostic accuracy of FFR<sub>CT</sub>.
KEY POINTS: • Physiological FFR<sub>CT</sub> decline depends not only on vessel length but also on the lumen volume in non-obstructive coronary artery disease in the right coronary artery. • FFR<sub>CT</sub> correlates with plaque-related parameters (low-attenuation plaque, intermediate-attenuation plaque, and calcified plaque) and vessel-related parameters (proximal and distal vessel diameter, vessel length, lumen volume, and V/L ratio). • Of vessel-related parameters, V/L ratio is the strongest predictor of a distal FFR<sub>CT</sub> and an optimal cut-off value of 8.1 mm3/mm.
