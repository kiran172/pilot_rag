Title: Resection of extrahepatic bile ducts with partial hepatectomy for treating intra- and extrahepatic hepatolithiasis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of our new surgical procedures for primary intra- and extrahepatic hepatolithiasis. Hepatolithiasis is an intractable disease with frequent recurrences.
METHODS: From 1996 to 2005, 142 patients with intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic hepatolithiasis treated with the conventional surgical methods were included as the control group, while 128 consecutive patients treated with new surgical methods from 2006 to 2015 were included as the observation group. The new surgical procedures included a comprehensive intraoperative exploration of the bile ducts, focusing on the structure and function of the hilar bile duct and duodenal papilla, exploration of the affected liver, and bile culture.
RESULTS: The observation group had a significantly higher complete stone clearance rate than the control group (100% vs. 65.96%). The observation group had significantly lower incidences of cholangitis and bile duct stones, as well as a higher excellent and good long-term surgical efficacy rate (86.24% vs. 52.73%). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the control group had a higher risk for fair + poor efficacy than the observation group (HR: 8.47).
CONCLUSIONS: Our new surgical procedures are safe and can provide a good long-term efficacy for treating primary hepatolithiasis intra- and extrahepatic hepatolithiasis.
