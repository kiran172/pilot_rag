Title: Heyde's Syndrome - An Enigma.

Abstract: Heyde's syndrome (HS) is described as the association between recurrent bleeding from angiodysplasia of the gastrointestinal tract and aortic stenosis. Aortic valve replacement has been reported to stop the bleeding. In unfit patients, the options available are interventional or conservative management. We hereby report an elderly obese patient with severe comorbidity with complicated HS involving a narrow aortic root. She underwent left ventricular outlet myomectomy and aortic root replacement to promote better forward flow and prevent restenosis and recurrence of symptoms. She was discharged home symptom-free despite being on coumadin anticoagulants.
