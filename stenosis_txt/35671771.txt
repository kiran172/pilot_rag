Title: Epidemiology of Valvular Heart Disease.

Abstract: Acquired diseases of the aortic and mitral valves are the most common cause of morbidity and mortality among Valvular heart diseases. Aortic stenosis (AS) is increasing in incidence in the United States (4,43 US), driven largely by an aging demographic. Aortic valve replacement is the only effective treatment of AS and has a dramatic mortality benefit. Mitral valve regurgitation (MR) is the most common form of valvular heart disease (VHD) in the US, whereby MR is most often the result of mitral valve prolapse; rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a more common etiology of MR in underdeveloped countries. interventions for MR in the US are increasing.
