Title: Physiologic guidance for percutaneous coronary intervention: State of the evidence.

Abstract: Physiological assessment to guide the treatment of epicardial coronary stenoses has become a cornerstone of the field of interventional cardiology with an increasingly diverse range of indices available to the clinician. This review describes the evolution and physiologic basis of these functional indices, outlines the evidence base supporting each, and discusses their potential future role in efforts to further improve patient selection and outcomes in percutaneous coronary intervention.
