Title: Mucosa-Associated Lymphoid Tissue Lymphoma as a Rare Mimicker of Relapsing Polychondritis.

Abstract: Mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a low-grade B cell extranodal lymphoma characterized by clonal marginal zone lymphocyte proliferation. We report a case of MALT lymphoma with a relapsing polychondritis (RP)-like phenotype, manifesting as rapidly progressive tracheal stenosis requiring tracheotomy.
