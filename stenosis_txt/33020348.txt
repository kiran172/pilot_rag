Title: Left Ventricular Assist Device Implantation via Dual Left Thoracotomy in an Adult Patient with Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries.

Abstract: A 59-year-old man presented for possible durable ventricular assist device (VAD) implantation. He had previously been diagnosed with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, a ventricular septal defect, an atrial septal defect, pulmonary valve stenosis, and aortic valve regurgitation. In the previous 22 years, he had undergone palliative cardiac surgery 3 times. VAD implantation as a bridge to transplantation was planned. Owing to severe adhesions, mesocardia, a left ascending aorta, and moderate aortic regurgitation, we performed VAD implantation and aortic valve closure via a dual left thoracotomy and partial sternotomy.
