Title: HIV indirectly accelerates coronary artery disease by promoting the effects of risk factors: longitudinal observational study.

Abstract: Our objective was to assess whether human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infection directly or indirectly promotes the progression of clinical characteristics of coronary artery disease (CAD). 300 African Americans with asymptomatic CAD (210 male; age: 48.0 ± 7.2 years; 226 HIV-infected) who underwent coronary CT angiography at two time points (mean follow-up: 4.0 ± 2.3 years) were randomly selected from 1429 participants of a prospective epidemiological study between May 2004 and August 2015. We calculated Agatston-scores, number of coronary plaques and segment stenosis score (SSS). Linear mixed models were used to assess the effects of HIV-infection, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk, years of cocaine use on CAD. There was no significant difference in annual progression rates between HIV-infected and-uninfected regarding Agatston-scores (10.8 ± 25.1/year vs. 7.2 ± 17.8/year, p = 0.17), the number of plaques (0.2 ± 0.3/year vs. 0.3 ± 0.5/year, p = 0.11) or SSS (0.5 ± 0.8/year vs. 0.5 ± 1.3/year, p = 0.96). Multivariately, HIV-infection was not associated with Agatston-scores (8.3, CI: [- 37.2-53.7], p = 0.72), the number of coronary plaques (- 0.1, CI: [- 0.5-0.4], p = 0.73) or SSS (- 0.1, CI: [- 1.0-0.8], p = 0.84). ASCVD risk scores and years of cocaine-use significantly increased all CAD outcomes among HIV-infected individuals, but not among HIV-uninfected. Importantly, none of the HIV-medications were associated with any of the CAD outcomes. HIV-infection is not directly associated with CAD and therefore HIV-infected are not destined to have worse CAD profiles. However, HIV-infection may indirectly promote CAD progression as risk factors may have a more prominent role in the acceleration of CAD in these patients.
