Title: Atypical Presentation of Marantic Endocarditis.

Abstract: We describe a 39-year-old man referred for surgical aortic valve replacement for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Intraoperative inspection was unexpectedly consistent with marantic endocarditis. Pathology confirmed nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis. We present high-resolution intraoperative, diagnostic, and pathology images of nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis in a patient with antiphospholipid syndrome with atypical presentation.
