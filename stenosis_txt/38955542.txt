Title: Preliminary Clinical and Radiological Outcomes of the "No-Punch" Decompression Techniques for Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Spine Surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To avoid the most offending surgical instrument for dural tears, we develop a "no-punch" decompression technique for unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) spine surgery.
METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled 68 consecutive patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis segments. The treatment results were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) for low back and leg pain, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) scores, and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Radiological outcomes were evaluated using the preoperative and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: This study included 36 male and 32 female patients who received 109 segments of decompression, with an average age of 68.7 (37-90 years). The average operation time was 52.2 minutes. The average hospital stay was 3.1 days. There were no dural tears but 3 minor surgical complications, all treated conservatively. The VAS for low back and leg pain improved from 4.6 and 7.0 to 0.8 and 1.2. The JOA score improved from 16.2 to 26.8, with an improvement rate of 82.0%. The ODI improved from 50.1 to 18.7. All these improvements were statistically significant. The cross-sectional dural area improved from 61.1 to 151.3 mm2, with an average increase of 90.2 mm2 and 205.3%. 87.1% of the ipsilateral facet joints and 84.7% of the contralateral facet joints were preserved. In 61% of the decompressed segments, the ipsilateral facet joints were preserved better than the contralateral facet joints.
CONCLUSION: The UBE "no-punch" decompression technique effectively avoids the dural tears. It provides effective neural decompression, excellent facet joint preservation, and good treatment outcomes.
