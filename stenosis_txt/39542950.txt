Title: Renovascular hypertension - a primer for the radiologist.

Abstract: Renovascular hypertension (RVHT) is an important cause of secondary hypertension, accounting for approximately 75% of cases. This pictorial review describes the imaging modalities used to diagnose RVHT, including ultrasound, computed tomography angiography, and magnetic resonance angiography, provides their benefits and limitations, and explores the imaging findings, diagnostic criteria, and management of multiple causes of RVHT. Atherosclerosis is the most common cause of RVHT, particularly in older individuals, while fibromuscular dysplasia is more prevalent in younger females. Less common discussed etiologies include polyarteritis nodosa, extrinsic compression, Page kidney, dissection, renal artery (RA) thrombus, and RA aneurysms. This paper also highlights the importance of recognizing anatomical variants and rare conditions that can impact diagnosis and management. While RVHT represents a minority of hypertension cases, its potential reversibility makes accurate diagnosis crucial. Treatment approaches vary based on etiology and may include medical management, angioplasty, stenting, or surgical intervention. This review aims to enhance radiologists' understanding of RVHT, facilitating improved diagnosis and patient care.
