Title: Risk of secondary embolism events during mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke: A single-center study based on histological analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Secondary embolism (SE) is a common adverse event during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for acute intracranial large vessel occlusion, which could lead to incomplete revascularization and increased maneuvers. However, the mechanisms behind SE are still unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the risk factors of SE, with a focus on clot composition.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients with retrieved clots were reviewed. Histologic examination for thrombus included Hematoxylin and eosin, Martius Scarlet Blue, immunohistochemistry for von Willebrand factor (VWF). Patients included were assigned to SE or no SE group. The differences in histological composition and clinical characteristics were compared, and logistic regression was conducted for predictors of SE.
RESULTS: Fifty-four patients were included, of which 19 were identified as having an SE. For patients with SE, there was more history of stroke or transient cerebral ischemia (TIA) (57.9 % vs. 28.6 %, p = 0.035), more occlusion located in terminal internal carotid artery (ICA) (63.2 % vs. 25.7 %, p = 0.007), relatively more contact aspiration used as frontline strategy (68.4 % vs. 45.7 %, p = 0.110), and less eTICI2c-3 recanalization achieved (52.6 % vs. 91.4 %, p = 0.003). As for histologic composition, the clots in SE group showed a higher proportion of erythrocyte fractions (42.9 % vs. 26.8 %, p = 0.045), while the other components were comparable with the non-SE group. Multivariate analysis suggested that a history of stroke or TIA (OR 6.45, 95 %CI 1.41-29.44, p = 0.016) and ICA occlusion (OR 8.05, 95 %CI 1.80-36.10, p = 0.006) could independently predict SE.
CONCLUSION: History of TIA or stroke and occlusion in the terminal ICA were found to be independent predictors for SE. Thrombus with a higher erythrocyte fractions might be more fragile. Further studies are needed.
