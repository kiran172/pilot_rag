Title: Surgical and endovascular revascularization of chronic mesenteric ischemia.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a rare but life-threatening disease. This study reviewed outcomes in patients treated surgically for CMI by open treatment (OT) and endovascular treatment (ET), analyzing risk factors for endovascular failure.
METHODS: Clinical data for 36 patients treated for CMI from 2007 to 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The study's primary endpoint was symptom-free survival. The secondary endpoint was the primary technical success for endovascular and open surgical treatments. Risk factors for endovascular failure were identified by using univariate analysis.
RESULTS: Patients were analyzed as treated: 21 patients (58.3%) in the ET and 15 (41.6%) in the OT group. Overall, 20 patients (56%) presented with abdominal angina, 9 (25%) with rest pain, and 7 (19%) without symptoms. An ET was initially attempted in 31 patients (86.1%). The conversion rate from ET to OT was 32.3%, which resulted in a primary technical success of 67.6% in ET and 100% in OT. Six patients from the ET group (19.3%) required surgical revision due to restenosis. One-year (OT 91.6% vs. ET 96.8%; n.s.) and three-year primary patency (OT 91.6% vs. ET 80.6%; n.s.) as well as 3-year symptom-free survival did not differ between the groups (OT 62.5% vs. ET 69.4%; n.s). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 2.8% (n = 1), which was not statistically different between the groups (OT 6% vs. ET 0%; n.s.). High-grade stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery tended to be associated with higher technical failure (P = 0.06).
CONCLUSIONS: ET showed a comparable perioperative outcome with higher technical failure. OT was distinguished by excellent early and late technical success.
