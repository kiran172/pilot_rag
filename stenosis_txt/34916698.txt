Title: [Application of Rotarex mechanical thrombectomy system in acute lower limb ischemia].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Rotarex mechanical thrombectomy system in treating acute lower limb ischemia.
METHODS: From December 2017 to December 2019, the clinical data of 23 acute lower limb ischemia cases treated with Rotarex mechanical thrombectomy system were retrospectively analyzed. There were 14 males and 9 females from 53- to 84-year-old patients and the mean age was (69.1±9.1) years. Duration of symptoms was 6 hours to 14 days (median time 7 days). In the study, 8 acute thromboembolism cases and 15 acute thrombosis cases were included (In which, there was one thromboangiitis obliterans case and two in-stent restenosis cases). In 5 cases, the lesions were located above the groin; in 16 cases, the lesions were located below the groin, and in the other 2 cases, the lesions were located both above and below the groin. All the cases were treated with Rotarex mechanical thrombectomy system. When residual stenosis was greater than 50%, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was used, and stent was used only when it was necessary. Heparin was used 24 h after the procedure, and after that, antiplatelet agents were used in acute thrombosis cases, and oral anti-coagulants were used in acute thromboembolism cases. Doppler ultrasonography was taken during the follow-up.
RESULTS: In all the 23 cases, there were 22 successful cases and 1 unsuccessful case, the mean procedure time was (68.2±15.6) min. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was used in 18 cases, 7 of which were implanted stents (3 stents were implanted in iliac artery and 4 in superficial femoral artery). There were 3 procedure related complications. The first one was arterial wall injury which resulted in contrast medium extravazation, and in this case, we solved it with prolonged balloon inflation. The second one was distal embolism. We took out the thrombus with guiding catheter. The last one was acute occlusion in a stent, and thrombectomy was applied urgently, and the result was good. Mean hospital stay were (3.6±1.7) days. The ankle brachial index (ABI) increased from 0.25±0.10 to 0.85±0.16 after treatment (t=12.901, P &lt; 0.001). All the patients were followed up for 4.0-28.0 months, and the median time was 12.0 months. One patient stopped antiplatelet agents, which resulted in acute thrombosis 2 months later. Another percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy and PTA were taken. In the failed case, the patient suffered amputation above the knee 3 months later and in another case, the patient died of heart failure 8 months after the procedure. Two target lesion restenosis occurred during the follow-up. Because the patients' symptom was not sever, no procedure was taken.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy using Rotarex catheter is safe and effective in treating acute lower limb ischemia. For one side, it can restore blood flow to the affected limbs quickly, and for the other, it has the characteristics of minimally invasive and good repeatability. So it should be considered that this me-thod can be widely used for acute lower limb ischemia.
