Title: Lumbar Spine Posttherapeutic Imaging.

Abstract: Management of patients after lumbar spine surgery or interventional radiology can be complex, and postoperative imaging patterns are often poorly understood by nonspecialized radiologists. This article focuses on postoperative imaging features of the lumbar spine in five clinical settings (with corresponding interventions): vertebral osteoporotic fractures (percutaneous vertebroplasty and vertebral augmentation), lumbar disk herniation (surgical diskectomy and percutaneous interventional radiology), lumbar spinal stenosis (surgical decompression), lumbar spondylolisthesis (surgical decompression and fusion), and degenerative scoliosis (techniques of osteotomies).For each intervention, we discuss imaging indications, depending if the patient is asymptomatic or if there are suspected complications, describe normal and pathologic imaging features, and present key points.
