Title: Tracheal In Vitro Reconstruction Using a Decellularized Bio-Scaffold in Combination with a Rotating Bioreactor.

Abstract: Long-segment airway stenosis as well as their neoplastic transformation is life-threatening and still currently represent unsolved clinical problems. Indeed, despite several attempts, definitive surgical procedures are not presently available, and a suitable tracheal reconstruction or replacement remains an urgent clinical need. A possible innovative strategic solution to restore upper airway function may be represented by the creation of a bioprosthetic trachea, obtained through the combination of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.Here we describe a two-step protocol for the ex vivo generation of tracheal segments. The first step involves the application of a decellularization technique that allows for the production of a naturally derived extracellular matrix (ECM)-based bio-scaffold, that maintains the macro- and micro-architecture as well as 9 the matrix-related signals distinctive of the original tissue. In the second step chondrocytes are seeded onto decellularized trachea, using a rotating bioreactor to ensure a correct scaffold repopulation.This multi-step approach represents a powerful tool for in vitro reconstruction of a bioengineered trachea that may constitute a promising solution to restore upper airway function. In addition, the procedures here described allow for the creation of a suitable 3D platform that may find useful applications, both for toxicological studies as well as organ transplantation strategies.
