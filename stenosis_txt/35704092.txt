Title: The use of single-stapling techniques reduces anastomotic complications in minimal-invasive rectal surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Leakage of rectal anastomoses is one of the most important and feared complications in colorectal surgery. Apart from patient-specific risk factors, technical aspects may influence the occurrence of anastomotic complications. This study investigated whether using single-stapling techniques (SST) instead of the double-stapling technique (DST) for minimal-invasive rectal anastomosis is associated with a lower rate of anastomotic complications.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 272 patients who received a minimally invasive stapled rectal anastomosis (3-16 cm from the anal verge) at our institution from 2015 to 2020 was performed. In 131 patients, rectal anastomosis was created by SST (SST group), while 141 patients received a rectal anastomosis with crossing stapler lines (DST group). The impact of the anastomotic technique on patient outcomes was determined by uni- and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Overall anastomotic leakage rate was 6%. Patients with SST anastomoses had a lower leakage rate than patients with DST anastomoses (3% vs. 9% in the DST group, p = 0.045). The rate of anastomotic stenosis was lower in the SST group than in the DST group (1% vs. 6%, p = 0.037). Overall morbidity and mortality did not differ between the two groups. Multivariate analysis showed that single-stapling techniques significantly reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage (OR 3.5 [1.0-11.5], p = 0.043).
CONCLUSION: The use of SST for rectal anastomosis may help to reduce anastomotic complications. This finding should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial.
