Title: Excellent Survival With a Focus on Pulmonary Artery Reinterventions After the Arterial Switch Operation.

Abstract: Background: We sought to evaluate the outcomes in patients who underwent the arterial switch operation (ASO) over a 20-year period at a single institution. Methods: The current study is a retrospective review of 180 consecutive patients who underwent the ASO for biventricular surgical correction of dextro-transposition of the great arteries (d-TGA) between 2002 and 2022. Results: Among 180 patients, 121 had TGA-intact ventricular septum, 47 had TGA-ventricular septal defect and 12 had Taussig-Bing Anomaly (TBA). The median follow-up time was 6.7 years (interquartile range: 3.9-8.7 years). There were five early (2.8%) and one late (0.6%) mortality. Survival was 96.6% at one year and beyond. Reoperations were performed in 31 patients (17%). Taussig Bing Anomaly was found to increase the risk of reoperation by 17 times (P &lt; .0001). A total of 37 (21%) patients underwent 53 reinterventions (14 surgical procedures, 39 catheter interventions) specifically addressing pulmonary artery (PA) stenosis. Freedom from PA reintervention was 97%, 87%, 70%, and 55% at 1, 5, 10, and 15 years, respectively. By bivariable analysis, TBA (P = .003, odds ratio [OR]: 6.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.9-21.7), mild PA stenosis at discharge (P ≤ .001, OR: 6.1, 95% CI: 2.7-13.6), and moderate or severe PA stenosis at discharge (P ≤ .001, OR: 12.7, 95% CI: 5-32.2) were identified as predictors of reintervention on PA. In the last follow-up of 174 survivors, 24 patients (14%) had moderate or greater PA stenosis, two (1%) had moderate neoaortic valve regurgitation, and 168 were New York Heart Association status I. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated excellent survival and functional status following the ASO for d-TGA; however, patients remain subject to frequent reinterventions especially on the pulmonary arteries.
