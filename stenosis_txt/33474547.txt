Title: One-Year Costs Associated with Hospitalizations Due to Aortic Stenosis in Canada.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a lack of data on the burden of patients hospitalized with aortic stenosis (AS) in Canada. The primary study objective was to document the index and 1-year costs of hospitalized patients with AS in Canada. Secondary objectives were to explore results by treatment modality and Canadian provinces.
METHODS: Hospitalized patients with a most responsible diagnosis (MRD) of AS during fiscal year 2014/2015 were identified using Canadian administrative databases. Costs were calculated for the index admission and for up to 1 year. For our secondary analyses, patients were classified according to the intervention received: surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), SAVR with coronary artery bypass graft, or transfemoral or transapical transcatheter aortic valve implantation. Hospitalized AS patients who did not undergo SAVR or transcatheter aortic valve implantation were classified as the untreated group. The data were also analyzed by Canadian provinces.
RESULTS: During fiscal year 2014/15, a total of 7217 Canadians were hospitalized with an MRD of AS. The mean (standard deviation) age of our population was 74.2 (11.5) years, and 39% were female. The 1-year hospital costs associated with an MRD of AS in Canada were calculated at $393 million. Our secondary analyses suggest that patient demographics (mean age ranging from 69 to 82 years) and outcomes (median length of stay ranging from 6 to 12 days) differ among treatment modalities and Canadian provinces.
CONCLUSIONS: AS hospitalizations result in a significant cost burden in Canada. Future research is needed to better understand variation among treatment modalities and Canadian provinces.
