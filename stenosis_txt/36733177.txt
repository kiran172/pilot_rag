Title: [A Case Report of Perianal Paget's Disease Treated with Robot-Assisted Surgery for Positive Margins after Local Excision].

Abstract: The patient is a 73-year-old man who was diagnosed with perianal Paget's disease by skin biopsy. Biopsy from the dentate line did not show any tumor cells. The patient was considered to undergo sphincter-preserving local resection and subsequently underwent the procedure. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed perianal Paget's disease with a positive anorectal margin. The patient was referred to our department due to postoperative anal stenosis. On the 32nd postoperative day, a double barreled sigmoid colostomy was performed. However, considering the inability to adequately check for detect due to anorectal stenosis and the expected unfavorable anorectal function caused by sphincter- preserving re-operation, a robot-assisted abdominoperineal resection(D1)was performed 7 months after the initial surgery. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed no residual tumor cells in the resected specimen. After local excision for perianal Paget's disease, the skin of the buttock becomes scarred due to skin valve formation and skin grafting, making closure of the perineal wound difficult when performing abdominoperineal resection. In robot-assisted surgery, it is relatively easy to remove the anorectal muscles from the abdominal cavity and reach the sciatico-rectal fossa, thus reducing the size of the perineal wound.
