Title: [A woman with wheezing].

Abstract: A 26-year-old patient experiencing dyspnoea and wheezing during exercise was seen at the outpatient clinic. Asthma was considered, but treatment with salbutamol was unsuccessful. Spirometry revealed plateauing of the inspiratory and expiratory flow-volume loops. CT scan and additional flexible bronchoscopy with dilatation showed circumferential subglottic stenosis. ANA/ANCA tests were negative and biopsy revealed scar tissue with minimal inflammation. Based on these findings, we established a diagnosis of idiopathic subglottic stenosis.
