Title: The Ross Procedure in Adolescence and Beyond: Are There Still Contraindications?

Abstract: The Ross procedure is an excellent operation to treat children and adults with aortic valve disease. Compared to prosthetic aortic valve replacement, it provides important clinical benefits in terms of survival, hemodynamics, freedom from valve-related complications, and durability, especially in women of childbearing age. However, the Ross procedure is a longer and technically more challenging operation. As a result, the choice of procedure should be driven by patient anatomy and clinical characteristics. This highlights the importance of concentrating care in Ross reference centers where surgical expertise and experience are present to ensure patient safety and long-term effectiveness of the operation. This manuscript reviews the major and relative contraindications to the Ross procedure.
