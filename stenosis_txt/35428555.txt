Title: Non-cardiovascular readmissions after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: Insights from a Japanese nationwide registry of transcatheter valve therapies.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite advances in technology and technique, a certain proportion of patients experience non-cardiovascular (CV) readmissions after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, the actual burden and details of non-CV readmission remain uncertain.
METHODS: The Japan-Transcatheter Valve Therapies (J-TVT) registry is a representative nationwide registry, and mandates complete data entry, including 1-year outcomes, for patients undergoing TAVR in Japan. We analyzed the non-CV adverse events (AEs) requiring readmission after the index TAVR procedure between 2013 and 2018.
RESULTS: A total of 14,472 patients were analyzed (68.8% of women with median age of 85 years). Overall, 367 patients (2.5%) and 1050 patients (7.2%) had non-CV readmission at 30 days and 1 year, respectively. The most frequent non-CV AEs were related to respiratory (24.0%) and gastrointestinal disease (19.3%). Specifically, 79.0% of all respiratory AEs were pneumonia (infectious, interstitial, or aspiration). Of the gastrointestinal AEs, 22.1% were malignancies, and 18.5% were non-procedural-related bleeding. Age ≥90 years, male sex, body mass index &lt;20 kg/m2, New York Heart Association functional class III/IV, atrial fibrillation/flutter, malignancy, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dialysis, hemoglobin level, albumin level, creatinine level, and non-transfemoral approach were independent predictors of non-CV readmission.
CONCLUSIONS: In this analysis of the nationwide registry of patients undergoing TAVR, rate of non-CV readmission at 30 days and 1 year, particularly those related to respiratory and gastrointestinal conditions, were lower than those previously reported. However, caution is still needed when performing TAVR on patients susceptible to these conditions.
