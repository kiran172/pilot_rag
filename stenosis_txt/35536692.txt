Title: Delayed Presentation of First Rib Osteomyelitis Following Trauma.

Abstract: Rib osteomyelitis can be caused by a contiguous infection after a traumatic fracture. Post traumatic osteomyelitis can present as chronic six or more weeks after bone infection. However, this patient developed first rib osteomyelitis 17 years after trauma, following the initiation of anticoagulation therapy. 17 years ago, a 55-year-old male patient was in a motor vehicle collision. He was diagnosed with a left first rib fracture and an internal carotid dissection. He subsequently underwent a left subclavian central venous catheter placement. His rib fracture was managed nonoperatively and the carotid dissection was treated with endovascular stent placement. He now presents with symptomatic carotid stent stenosis which is treated with anti-platelet and anticoagulation therapy. He then developed a hematoma over the old rib fracture, and subsequently developed acute osteomyelitis. As seen here, a remote history of traumatic first rib fracture remains a risk factor for osteomyelitis despite the passage of time.
