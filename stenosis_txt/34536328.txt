Title: The hemodynamic spectrum of pulmonary vein stenosis from fibrosing mediastinitis.

Abstract: A 63-year-old man presented with hemoptysis and progressive dyspnea. His echocardiogram was concerning for pulmonary hypertension (PH) and CT chest showed fibrosing mediastinitis with possible cardiac involvement. Right heart catheterization revealed PH at rest and worsened with exercise. CT findings and simultaneous measurement of pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), left atrial pressure, and left ventricular pressure helped diagnose pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis as the etiology of his PH. Both upper pulmonary veins were stented, and repeat exercise hemodynamic study revealed a substantial reduction in pulmonary arterial pressure with improvement in subjective dyspnea, cardiac output reserve, mechanical efficiency, and ventilatory efficiency. Repeat right upper PCWP normalized, consistent with resolution of the PV stenosis.
