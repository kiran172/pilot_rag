Title: Transient Budd-Chiari syndrome secondary to blunt traumatic bile fistula: A case report.

Abstract: Budd-Chiari syndrome (BCS) is rarely caused by trauma. We reported a case of transient and secondary BCS post polytrauma that resulting from massive perihepatic and abdominal fluid and compressed liver, causing stenosis of the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins. This was a special BCS case related to but not directly caused by trauma. With conservative management and active surgical procedures, the patient recovered well.
