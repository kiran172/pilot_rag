Title: Headache as the sole clinical manifestation of acute myocardial infarction: one case with cardiac cephalalgia and literature review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Cardiac cephalalgia, once seen as a rare symptom of coronary artery disease, is now more recognized. It often comes with chest discomfort and autonomic dysfunction, worsened by physical activity. However, not all cases have chest symptoms or are activity induced. This report presents a case of cardiac cephalalgia and reviews 46 previous cases.
METHOD: We discuss a unique case where a patient had headache attacks without chest symptoms, autonomic dysfunction, or triggers. We reviewed English case reports of cardiac cephalalgia from 1982 to 2022 using PubMed ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed ).
RESULTS: A 69-year-old man presented with a sudden headache without triggers or typical symptoms. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed diffuse stenosis in the left anterior descending and the first diagonal branch arteries. His headache improved after percutaneous coronary intervention. Cardiac cephalalgia is usually marked by severe headaches, autonomic signs, and often affects the occipital region. Electrocardiogram (ECG) might not always show abnormalities, and chest pain is not always present. In such cases, elevated cardiac enzymes can be crucial for diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: When a headache is the sole symptom of an acute coronary event, consider moderate to severe intensity, older age at onset, occipital localization, and autonomic signs. ECG, cardiac enzymes, and coronary CTA are valuable for accurate diagnosis and treatment.
