Title: [Correlation analysis of carotid adipose tissue density and plaque stability in patients with carotid artery stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the correlation between perivascular fat density (PFD) and plaque stability in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Methods: Clinical data of 110 patients with carotid artery stenosis treated at Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School from January 2018 to December 2022 were retrospectively collected. Based on pathological results of carotid plaque specimens obtained from carotid endarterectomy (CEA), patients were categorized into stable plaque group (n=51) and vulnerable plaque group (n=59). All patients underwent preoperative carotid CT angiography (CTA) to measure PFD at the narrowest carotid artery. Preoperative levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and other hematological parameters were collected. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with plaque stability in carotid artery stenosis patients. Area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was performed to evaluate the predictive value of PFD for plaque stability. Results: The stable plaque group consisted of 43 males and 8 females with a mean age of (67.6±9.0) years, while the vulnerable plaque group comprised 48 males and 11 females with a mean age of (69.3±9.0) years. The proportions of smokers were 31.4% (16/51) and 50.8% (30/59) in the stable and vulnerable plaque groups, respectively. The proportions of patients with diabetes were 33.3% (17/51) and 52.5% (31/59), respectively. IL-6 levels were 3.46(2.67, 5.34) and 4.51(3.62, 5.51) ng/L in the stable and vulnerable groups, respectively. Mean PFD values were (-69.04±5.35) and (-63.24±6.08) HU, respectively, with maximum PFD values of (-62.90±6.98) and (-56.93±5.90) HU, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (all P&lt;0.05). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that increased mean PFD (OR=1.167, 95%CI: 1.029-1.324, P=0.016) and elevated IL-6 levels (OR=1.489, 95%CI: 1.151-1.926, P=0.002) were associated with vulnerability of carotid artery plaques. ROC curve analysis results showed that a cut-off value of -65.5 HU, the AUC for predicting plaque stability based on the mean PFD was 0.756 (95%CI: 0.667-0.844, P&lt;0.001), with sensitivity of 64.4% and specificity of 74.5%. Conclusion: Increased mean PFD at the narrowest carotid artery is associated with vulnerability of plaques in patients with carotid artery stenosis.
