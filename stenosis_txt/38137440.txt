Title: Blockade of Inflammatory Markers Attenuates Cardiac Remodeling and Fibrosis in Rats with Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Since cardiac inflammation has been considered an important mechanism involved in heart failure, an anti-inflammatory treatment could control cardiac inflammation and mitigate the worsening of cardiac remodeling. This study evaluated the effects of dexamethasone (DEX) and ramipril treatment on inflammation and cardiac fibrosis in an experimental model of heart failure induced by supravalvular aortic stenosis. Wistar rats (21d) were submitted to an aortic stenosis (AS) protocol. After 21 weeks, an echocardiogram and a maximal exercise test were performed, and after 24 weeks, rats were treated with DEX, ramipril or saline for 14d. The left ventricle (LV) was removed for histological and inflammatory marker analyses. The AS group showed exercise intolerance (-32% vs. Sham), higher relative wall thickness (+63%), collagen deposition and capillary rarefaction, followed by cardiac disfunction. Both treatments were effective in reducing cardiac inflammation, but only DEX attenuated the increased relative wall thickness (-17%) and only ramipril reduced LV fibrosis. In conclusion, both DEX and ramipril decreased cardiac inflammatory markers, which probably contributed to the reduced cardiac fibrosis and relative wall thickness; however, treated AS rats did not show any improvement in cardiac function. Despite the complex pharmacological treatment of heart failure, treatment with an anti-inflammatory could delay the patient's poor prognosis.
