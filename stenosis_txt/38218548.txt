Title: Optic nerve compression: a rare ocular manifestation of Proteus syndrome.

Abstract: Proteus syndrome is characterized by progressive, asymmetric, and distorting overgrowth that involves the skeletal, cutaneous, subcutaneous, and nervous systems. We report the case of a 10-year-old girl with Proteus syndrome and a constellation of ocular signs, including congenital glaucoma, myopia, amblyopia, strabismus, megaloglobus, epibulbar tumors, and right retinal detachment. A decrease in left eye visual acuity coupled with significant deterioration in visual evoked potential response over time prompted urgent neuroimaging, which revealed massive overgrowth of the sphenoid bone, with bilateral optic nerve compression due to optic canal stenosis. Successful removal of the roof of the optic canal along its entire course resulted in optic nerve decompression.
