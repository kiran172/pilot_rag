Title: Characterizing Dysphonia After Pediatric Open Airway Reconstruction: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pediatric laryngotracheal stenosis often requires open airway reconstruction. While these surgeries establish an airway for adequate ventilation, many patients develop subsequent dysphonia. Numerous studies have reported outcomes related to voice.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate dysphonia in pediatric patients following open airway reconstruction, focusing on acoustic parameters, perceptual voice quality, and voice-related quality of life.
METHODS: A comprehensive search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines across 6 databases identified articles involving pediatric patients who underwent open airway reconstruction and reported postoperative vocal acoustic parameters, perceptual voice quality, voice-related quality of life, or vocal mechanics. Articles were assessed for bias risk, and common outcomes were synthesized qualitatively and quantitatively using meta-analyses.
RESULTS: Among 4089 articles, 21 were included, involving 497 pediatric patients. Laryngotracheoplasty was the most common procedure followed by cricotracheal resection. The Consensus Auditory-Perceptual Evaluation of Voice (CAPE-V) scale was frequently used to assess voice quality, with a mean score of 55.6 [95% confidence intervals (CIs): 47.9-63.3]. Voice-related quality of life was measured using the pediatric Voice Handicap Index (pVHI) and Pediatric Voice-Related Quality of Life Survey, with mean scores of 35.6 (95% CI: 21.4-49.7) and 83.7 (95% CI: 74.1-93.2), respectively. The fundamental frequency was 210.5 (95% CI: 174.6-246.3). Other common findings included supraglottic phonation, anterior commissure blunting, posterior glottic diastasis, and abnormal vocal cord mobility.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients experiencing dysphonia after open airway reconstruction exhibited moderately decreased voice quality and reduced voice-related quality of life. However, there was inconsistency in study protocols and outcome measures used. Preserving voice quality during airway reconstruction is crucial to avoid negative impacts on quality of life.
