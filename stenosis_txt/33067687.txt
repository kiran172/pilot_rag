Title: Morbidity and Mortality of Large-Vessel Vasculitides.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Giant cell arteritis (GCA) and Takayasu arteritis (TAK) comprise the primary systemic large-vessel vasculitides. In these conditions, arterial stenosis, occlusion, aneurysm, and dissection can lead to severe disease-related consequences. This review focuses on disease-related manifestations of GCA and TAK, emphasizing the impact of these findings on long-term morbidity and mortality.
RECENT FINDINGS: Vision loss remains a main contributor of morbidity in GCA. Non-invasive imaging allows for recognition of aortic disease in GCA but monitoring and intervention guidelines require further development. TAK represents a severe disease of early-onset with high risk of morbidity due to aortic, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and neurologic involvement. Overall, patients with GCA have similar mortality rates to comparators but mortality is notably higher than the general population in TAK. A multidisciplinary approach of expert subspecialists is required to assist with the complex care of patients with GCA and TAK in order to appropriately surveil, identify, and address the multi-faceted co-morbidities of these diseases.
