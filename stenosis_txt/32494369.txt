Title: Implication of image guidance in endoscopic third ventriculostomy: Technical note.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) is an advanced surgical procedure and plays a major role in the management of hydrocephalus. The complications associated with this procedure are grave and unforgiving. Image guidance system (IGS) can help reduce these complications. This technical note describes the technique for utilizing image guidance in carrying out ETV with safety and efficacy.
METHODS: The authors have performed ETV on more than 75 cases. We describe a step-by-step technique for the implication of image guidance while performing ETV including the trajectory planning, coregistration, approach, and third ventricular floor perforation. For illustration, we present the case of a 54-year-old female with moderate-intensity headache and central vertigo for 2 months presented with no significant findings on examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed dilated lateral and third ventricles with normal sized fourth ventricle. A diagnosis of aqueductal stenosis was made and ETV was performed under image guidance.
RESULTS: Since 2012, we performed 78 cases of ETV with the help of image guidance. None of the patients had any episode of intraoperative hemorrhage. Two patients (2.56%) had fornix contusions.
CONCLUSION: Image guidance can help reduce complications and is becoming an essential tool in performing ETV. IGS ETV technique may benefit young neurosurgeons the most and can help them overcome the learning curve with safety.
