Title: "Piggyback Pigtails": Simplifying secondary transradial access for TAVR.

Abstract: Minimalist approaches have evolved for TAVR over the last years with impact on in-hospital stay and patient safety. As part of this concept, transradial secondary arterial access is capable of reducing vascular and bleeding complications. Yet, steering of the marker pigtail catheter in the descending aorta might by fluoroscopic imaging sometimes be challenging. In our manuscript, we present a very simple "piggyback" technique, simplifying management of transradial secondary access in transfemoral TAVR.
