Title: Successful surgical resection and reconstruction for a huge primary cardiac lymphoma filling the right heart.

Abstract: Primary cardiac lymphoma (PCL) is rare, with a frequency of 1.0%-1.6% among cardiac malignant tumors. Chemotherapy is often selected as a first-line treatment for PCL. However, when the tumor causes heart failure or life-threatening hemodynamic collapse, antecedent urgent surgery is required. We herein report a successful case of complete tumor resection and reconstruction of the right atrium and right ventricle using a bovine pericardial patch combined with tricuspid valve replacement in a patient with a huge PCL filling the right heart that manifested as tricuspid valve stenosis and subsequent heart failure.
