Title: Trends and predictors of inflation-adjusted costs in transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement in a nationally representative sample.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become an accepted alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement. We examined the trends and predictors in inflation-adjusted costs of transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: National Inpatient Sample identified patients who underwent aortic valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revisions, codes. Hospitalization costs were inflation-adjusted using the Federal Reserve's consumer price index to reflect current valuation. Outcomes of interest were unadjusted trend in annual cost for each procedure and predictors of in-patient cost. Generalized linear models with a log link function identified predictors of adjusted costs. Interaction terms determined where cost predictors were different by operation type.
RESULTS: Between 2011 and 2019, the mean annual inflation-adjusted cost of surgical aortic valve replacement increased from $62,853 to $63,743, in contrast to decreasing cost of transcatheter aortic valve replacement from $64,913 to $56,042 ($1,854 per year; P = .004). Significant independent predictors of patient-level cost included operation type (transcatheter aortic valve replacement associated with $9,625 increase; P < .001), incidence of in-hospital mortality ($28,836 increase; P < .001), elective status ($2,410 decrease; P < .001), Elixhauser Index ($995 increase; P < .001), and postoperative length of stay ($2,014 per day increase; P < .001). Compared to discharges with Medicare, discharges with private insurance and Medicaid paid $736 less (P = .004) and $1,863 less (P = .01), respectively. Increasing hospital volume was a significant predictor of decreasing patient level cost (P < .001).
CONCLUSION: Annual cost of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has decreased significantly and has been a more cost-effective modality compared to surgical aortic valve replacement since 2017. Predictors of patient-level costs allow for mindful preparation of healthcare systems for aortic valve replacement.
