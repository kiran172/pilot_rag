Title: Effects of Endovascular Stent-Assisted Angioplasty on Cellular Metabolism in the Hippocampus of Elderly Patients with Symptomatic Vertebrobasilar Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Cerebral artery stenosis is closely related to cognitive function, and angioplasty can improve the cognitive function of elderly patients with vertebrobasilar artery stenosis. The specific mechanism, however, is not clear. This study explored the effect of angioplasty on cellular metabolism in the hippocampus of elderly patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar artery stenosis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Eighteen elderly patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar artery stenosis who underwent endovascular stent-assisted angioplasty (ESAA) in our department were studied. The changes in cellular metabolism (NAA / Cr, CHO / Cr, NAA / CHO) in bilateral hippocampal areas were detected by MRS before and at 6 months and 12 months after the ESAA. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA), Hamilton Depression Self-assessment Scale (HAMD), and Hamilton Anxiety Self-assessment Scale (HAMA) were also used to evaluate the cognition, depression, and anxiety of patients at different time points of the study, and analyzed the correlation between the changes of cellular metabolism in the hippocampus and the scores of MoCA, HAMD, and HAMA. RESULTS The levels of NAA/Cr in left/right hippocampal areas were significantly higher at 6 and 12 months after the ESAA than before (1.01±0.17/1.22±0.26 vs. 1.10±0.20/1.05±0.26 vs. 0.82±0.10/0.84±0.11, respectively) (P<0.01). MoCA scores were positively correlated with the levels of NAA/Cr in the left/right hippocampal areas (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). CONCLUSIONS ESAA can improve cognitive function of patients by changing the cellular metabolism of the hippocampus in elderly patients with symptomatic vertebrobasilar artery stenosis.
