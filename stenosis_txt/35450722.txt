Title: Routine Coronary Angiography is Still the Key Test for Patients Eligible for Lung Transplantation Also for Those With No Symptoms and With High Risk of Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of our work is to find a correlation between cardiovascular risk and coronary arterial status to optimize the selection of patients for coronary angiography prior transplantation.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 48 patients in whom coronary angiography and cardiac catheterization was performed during assessment for bilateral lung transplantation at the Medical University of Gda≈Ñsk from 2018 to 2021. The coronary artery disease status was classified into 2 categories: without any stenosis and with stenosis. For each patient, the 10-year cardiovascular risk was estimated by using a Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation calculator modified for the Polish population.
RESULTS: Coronary stenosis was detected in 15 patients during angiography (31%). The group with coronary stenosis had a median SCORE risk of 8%, which is considered as high risk, and in patients without stenosis it was 5%, which is also considered a high risk. Median mean pulmonary artery pressure in patients with stenosis was the same as that in patients without stenosis (23 mm Hg).
CONCLUSIONS: CAD among lung transplant candidates cannot be predicted by risk factors, so coronary angiography is very important as a part of the evaluation process. Because pulmonary hypertension has a big impact on surveillance after transplantation, performing heart catheterization during the qualification process is crucial.
