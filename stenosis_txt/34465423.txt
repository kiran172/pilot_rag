Title: Early-Isolated V Lesion in Kidney Allograft: Acute Rejection or Ischemic Injury? A Case Report of Primary Nonfunction and Graft Loss.

Abstract: Intimal arteritis (v-lesion) is a negative prognostic factor for kidney allograft survival. Early isolated v-lesions do not always represent a pathologic marker of acute T cell- or antibody-mediated rejection. In particular, in the case of transplant negative for C4d and donor-specific antibodies, such a finding can suggest an ischemic-reperfusion injury. There is an intense debate in the literature concerning the origin of this histologic feature. In the present study, we analyze how this argument can have a clinical relevance. Here we report a case of a 61-year-old woman with end-stage renal disease due to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. The patient underwent kidney transplant from expanded criteria donor. Organs from expanded criteria donors are more prone to ischemic-reperfusion injury. Postoperative course was characterized by primary nonfunction of the graft. A first biopsy showed early isolated v-lesion in otherwise normal renal parenchymal. Simultaneously, a computed tomography scan revealed stenosis of the main renal artery. An endovascular stent was placed. Despite improved vascularization of the graft, no clinical response was observed and the patient remained anuric. A second biopsy was performed, showing T-cell mediated rejection (Banff Classification 1A). Despite pulse steroid, the patient lost the graft.
