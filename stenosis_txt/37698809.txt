Title: Application of overlap anastomosis in digestive tract reconstruction during minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy.

Abstract: This study aims to assess the feasibility of the Overlap anastomosis technique in minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy. An accompanying video presentation elucidates our surgical procedures. A retrospective review of 46 patients diagnosed with middle and lower esophageal cancer was conducted. These patients underwent minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy with Overlap anastomosis between January 2019 and December 2020. A consistent team of surgeons performed all procedures. The initial phase involved laparoscopic stomach mobilization, intra-abdominal lymphadenectomies, and preparation of the tubular stomach. Subsequently, with the patient in the left decubitus position, thoracoscopy was used to dissect the esophagus, excise the diseased segment, and conduct mediastinal lymph node dissection. The final stage encompassed the intrathoracic gastroesophageal anastomosis using the Overlap method. All surgeries were completed without converting to an open approach, achieving complete resection. There were no operative fatalities, with an average surgery duration of 259.4 min. Average statistics included intraoperative blood loss of 92.3 ml, 16.2 lymph nodes dissected, and a postoperative hospital stay of 10.3 days. Postoperative complications comprised three instances of hoarseness due to recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy, two cases of aspiration pneumonia, one occurrence of chylothorax, and one gastric emptying disorder. Anastomotic technique-related complications were minimal, with only one patient experiencing an anastomotic leak that resolved spontaneously and two patients facing anastomotic stenosis, which was subsequently alleviated. Our findings posit that the Overlap anastomosis method is safe and efficient for minimally invasive Ivor-Lewis esophagectomy, marked by a notably low rate of anastomosis-related complications. Further evaluation of its long-term implications remains necessary.
