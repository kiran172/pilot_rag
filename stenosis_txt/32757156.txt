Title: Management of colorectal anastomotic stricture with multidiameter balloon dilation: long-term results.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postoperative colorectal anastomotic strictures are quite common. As such, many techniques have been available to address such a problem, one of which is endoscopic dilation. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the long-term outcomes following endoscopic dilation using a multidiameter balloon.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients with postoperative anastomotic stenosis treated with endoscopic dilation using a multidiameter balloon at our institution, in January 2005-December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed, excluding those with tumor recurrence. Perioperative factors, complications, and recurrence rates were analyzed.
RESULTS: There were 40 patients, (22 males and 18 females, mean age 64.6 ± 10.7 years, range 33-84 years). The median follow-up period was 56 months (interquartile range 22.5-99 months). Only 1 complication occurred, micro-perforation due to guided wire injury, which was managed conservatively. Five (12.5%) patients developed restenosis and underwent repeat balloon dilation. None of the five recurrences required more aggressive management, such as redo anastomosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic multidiameter balloon dilation is a safe and effective method for treating benign colorectal anastomotic strictures.
