Title: Coronary angiography using spectral detector dual-energy CT: is it the time to assess myocardial first-pass perfusion?

Abstract: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) represents a common approach to the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected coronary artery disease. Technological development has recently allowed the integration of conventional CCTA information with spectral data. Spectral CCTA used in clinical routine may allow for improving CCTA diagnostic performance by measuring myocardial iodine distribution as a marker of first-pass perfusion, thus providing additional functional information about coronary artery disease.
