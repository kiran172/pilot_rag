Title: Small Intestinal Contrast Ultrasonography (SICUS) in Crohn's Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: The diagnosis of Crohn's Disease (CD) is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, endoscopy, and imaging data. In Small Intestine Contrast Ultrasonography (SICUS), the ingestion of a macrogol solution as an oral contrast medium may optimize image quality. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the diagnostic performance of SICUS for CD. A literature search was performed in August 2023. We selected only studies where SICUS was compared to a technique that allows the assessment of the whole gastrointestinal tract, such as an MRE, a CT scan, or a surgical evaluation. We estimated pooled weighted sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratio for positive and negative tests (PLR/NLR) of SICUS. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) were drawn, and pooled areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Five studies with 325 CD patients were included. SICUS showed a pooled sensitivity for the diagnosis of 95% (95% confidence interval CI 89-99%), a specificity = 77% (95% CI 60-90%), and the AUC was 0.94. SICUS demonstrated a pooled sensitivity for strictures of 78% (95% CI 63-88%) and a specificity = 96% (95% CI 85-99%), with AUC = 0.93. For abscesses, SICUS demonstrated a pooled sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 59-100%) and a specificity of 90% (95% CI 74-98%). Fistulae were detected with a pooled sensitivity of 77% (95% CI 46-95%) and a specificity of 92% (95% CI 75-99%). SICUS demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance compared to the gold standard despite some clinical scenarios (stenosis/fistulae) showing suboptimal diagnostic effectiveness.
