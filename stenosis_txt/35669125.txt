Title: A Case of Symptomatic Myocardial Bridge Treated with Calcium Channel Blocker.

Abstract: Myocardial bridge (MB) is a congenital coronary anomaly in which a portion of the coronary artery courses intramyocardium instead of the normal trajectory on the epicardial surface. We report a case study with a 44-year-old man from Faryab Province in Afghanistan who presented chest pain and dizziness while suffering a common cold. After full investigation, the patient underwent coronary angiography which showed a myocardial bridge at the middle portion of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) with a significant stenosis causing ischemia. We treated the patient with a calcium channel blocker as initial treatment. The patient tolerated the medication well and remained asymptomatic during two years follow-up.
