Title: Challenges in the Management of Laryngo-Tracheo-Bronchial Stenosis Secondary to Tuberculosis.

Abstract: Laryngo-tracheo-bronchial tuberculosis may be primary or secondary to pulmonary tuberculosis. It causes stenosis of the airway, leading to life threatening airway obstruction. We herein describe the challenges in managing a case of laryngo-tracheo-bronchial stenosis in a 22-year-old patient who presented with stridor post antituberculous therapy secondary to a malacic airway.
