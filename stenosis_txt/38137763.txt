Title: Prognostic Relevance of Global Myocardial Work Index in Patients with Moderate Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A reduced global myocardial work index (GWI) ≤ 1951 mmHg% is associated with increased mortality in patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS). However, parameters predicting the outcome in patients with moderate AS are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of the GWI in patients with moderate AS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this prospective study, 103 patients with moderate AS (mean age 72 ± 10 years; male: 69%) underwent standardized transthoracic echocardiography. The primary endpoint was survival without an aortic valve replacement (AVR). After a median follow-up of 30 ± 5 months, 37 patients (36%) were referred for an AVR. Survival without an AVR was 96% at 12 months and 80% at 30 months (&gt;1951 mmHg%) versus 96% and 68% (≤1951 mmHg%). A GWI ≤ 1951 mmHg% did not predict the need for an AVR (hazard ratio 1.31 (95% CI, 0.63-2.72), p = 0.49). Furthermore, there was no significant correlation between the mean GWI (1644 ± 448 mmHg%) and mean aortic valve pressure gradient (24.2 mmHg ± 6.2, p = 0.615) or effective aortic orifice area (1.24 cm2 ± 0.11, p = 0.678). There was no difference between the AVR and non-AVR groups in the occurrence of clinical symptoms.
CONCLUSION: In contrast to patients with severe AS, a GWI ≤ 1951 mmHg% did not predict the need for an AVR. Further research is needed to improve the risk stratification in patients with moderate AS.
