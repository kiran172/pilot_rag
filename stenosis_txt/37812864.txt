Title: Echocardiographic and Clinical Outcomes in Symptomatic Patients With Less Than Severe Aortic Stenosis After Supra-Annular Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Optimal timing for aortic valve replacement in symptomatic patients with less than severe aortic stenosis (AS) is not well defined. There is limited information on the benefit of valve replacement in these patients. Symptomatic patients with less than severe AS, defined as a mean aortic gradient ≥20 and &lt;40 mm Hg, peak aortic velocity &gt;3 and &lt;4 m/s, and aortic valve area &gt;1.0 and &lt;1.5 cm2, enrolled in the Society for Thoracic Surgery/American College of Cardiology Transcatheter Valve Therapy Registry and who underwent attempted supra-annular, self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) were reviewed. Site-reported valve hemodynamics, clinical events, and quality of life metrics were analyzed at 30 days and 1 year after the procedure. A total of 1,067 patients with attempted TAVR (mean age 78.4 ± 8.4 years; Society for Thoracic Surgery score 4.7 ± 3.4%) were found to have symptoms but less than severe AS. From baseline to postprocedure, mean gradient decreased (29.9 ± 4.9 vs 8.4 ± 4.8 mm Hg, p &lt;0.001), and aortic valve area increased (1.2 ± 0.1 vs 2.2 ± 0.7 cm2, p &lt;0.001). Clinical events included 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality (1.5% and 9.6%), stroke (2.2% and 3.3%), and new pacemaker implantation (18.1% and 20.9%). There were statistically significant improvements in the New York Heart Association functional class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire at 30 days and 1 year. In conclusion, patients with symptomatic but less than severe AS who underwent supra-annular, self-expanding TAVR experienced improved valve hemodynamics and quality of life measures 1 year after the procedure. Randomized studies of TAVR versus a control arm in symptomatic patients with less than severe AS are ongoing.
