Title: Correlation Between Risk Factors, Degree of Vascular Restenosis, and Inflammatory Factors After Interventional Treatment for Stroke: A Two-Center Retrospective Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation between risk factors, degree of vascular restenosis, and inflammatory factors after interventional treatment for stroke.
METHODS: The clinical data of 96 stroke patients who received interventional therapy in our hospital from April 2020 to June 2021 were selected for retrospective study, and the postoperative follow-up was 1 year. Univariate and multivariate regression were used to analyze identified factors associated with interventional stroke efficacy. At the same time, the value of inflammatory factor levels in predicting vascular restenosis after interventional stroke was analyzed.
RESULTS: According to our findings, several risk factors, including body mass index ≥ 25.51 kg/m 2 , smoking, drinking, hypertension, and diabetes, were identified as contributors to poor postoperative efficacy following stroke intervention ( P <0.05). Furthermore, a notable association was observed between the severity of vascular stenosis ( P <0.001) and the levels of interleukin 6, interleukin 2, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein. The combined assessment of these serum inflammatory factors exhibited excellent predictive capability for postoperative vascular restenosis and stenosis severity, yielding a sensitivity of 84.30%, a specificity of 81.20%, and an area under the curve of 0.882.
CONCLUSIONS: Obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption, hypertension, and diabetes have been found to be associated with suboptimal outcomes following interventional treatment for stroke. The assessment of preoperative levels of inflammatory factors holds promise in predicting the likelihood of postoperative restenosis to a certain degree.
