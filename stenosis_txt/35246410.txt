Title: Percutaneous Treatment for Venous Stenosis Caused by a Vascular Closure Device.

Abstract: Vascular closure devices (VCDs) are widely used as an alternative to manual compression of femoral puncture sites. In this report, we present a 73-year-old man who developed symptomatic venous stenosis related to VCD after pulmonary vein isolation. We performed percutaneous treatment with balloon angioplasty. This case suggests that balloon angioplasty with proper safety measures can be an option for treating venous stenosis related to VCDs.
