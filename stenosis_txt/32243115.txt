Title: The deltopectoral flap in the management of tracheostomal stenosis post laryngectomy and radiotherapy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheostomal stenosis is a distressing complication with a high incidence rate post laryngectomy. We aimed to assess the deltopectoral flap (DPF) for tracheostomal stenosis correction in irradiated patients.
METHODS: Six patients with tracheostomal stenosis, 3 of whom developed restenosis after prior use of local flaps, were managed using a DPF to reconstruct the defect following a vertical incision release of the stenotic band down to the inferior tracheal cartilaginous ring. Healing absence of restenosis, alleviation of the symptoms of difficulty in breathing and clearance of secretions were considered a successful composite endpoint.
RESULTS: Over a median follow-up period of 11 months all patients maintained patency, and symptoms of difficulty in breathing and clearing of secretions were alleviated.
CONCLUSION: The deltopectoral flap is a rapid, reliable flap for the management of tracheostomal stenosis in irradiated patients. It brings well-vascularised tissue into the site of reconstruction and, in the short term, stomal patency and symptom relief were achieved.
