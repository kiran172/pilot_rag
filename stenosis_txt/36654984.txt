Title: Catastrophic Fibromuscular Dysplasia Presenting with Concomitant Bilateral Renal Infarction, Vertebral Artery Dissection, and Mesenteric Ischaemia.

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-atherosclerotic, non-inflammatory disorder of the arterial wall muscular layer which can lead to arterial stenosis, occlusion, and dissection. Clinical presentations of FMD vary depending on the arterial territories involved, often leading to diagnostic challenges. This case report describes an exceptionally unusual presentation of FMD, not previously described, affecting a previously fit and well 37-year-old female presenting with bilateral renal infarction, sequential vertebral artery dissections, mesenteric ischaemia, and the requirement for continued renal replacement. This report highlights how unusual presentations of FMD can mask the underlying diagnosis. Early consideration of FMD in a differential diagnosis can guide an effective management strategy, including appropriate imaging and multi-speciality involvement.
