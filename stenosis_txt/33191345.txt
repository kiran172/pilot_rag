Title: Determinants of Periprocedural Myocardial Infarction in Current Elective Percutaneous Coronary Interventions.

Abstract: Periprocedural myocardial infarction (PMI) is closely associated with long-term cardiovascular events. The factors associated with PMI are not fully understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate the determinants of PMI in contemporary elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Overall, 731 elective PCI was divided into the PMI (n = 27) and non-PMI (n = 704) groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to find factors associated with PMI. In the univariate analysis, PMI was associated with complex lesion characteristics, such as the lesion length, lesion angle, calcification, and Medina classification. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the lesion length (per 10-mm increase: odds ratio (OR), 1.477; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.161‒1.879; P = 0.002), lesion angle ≥ 45° (versus lesion angle < 45°: OR, 4.244; 95% CI, 1.187‒15.171; P = 0.026), and Medina classification (0,1,1) / (1,1,1) (versus other lesions: OR, 14.843; 95% CI, 6.235‒35.334; P < 0.001) were significantly associated with PMI. Of the 24 lesions with lesion angle ≥ 45° in the PMI group, 14 had final TIMI flow grade ≤ 2 in side branches and 9 had transient slow flow in main branches/transient ST elevation during PCI. Of the 87 lesions with Medina classification (1,1,1) / (0,1,1), 19 had final TIMI grade ≤ 2 in side branches. In conclusion, the lesion length, lesion angle ≥ 45°, and Medina classification (0,1,1) / (1,1,1) were significantly associated with PMI in contemporary elective PCI. Preventing flow limitation in both side branches and main vessels in elective PCI for the diffuse long, angulated, or true bifurcation lesions is important.
