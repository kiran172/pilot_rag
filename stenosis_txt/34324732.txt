Title: Efficacy of double-balloon enteroscopy-assisted endoscopic balloon dilatation combined with stent deployment for hepaticojejunostomy anastomotic stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hepaticojejunostomy anastomotic stricture (HJAS) is a significant complication of biliary reconstruction surgery. Endoscopic management of HJAS using double-balloon enteroscopy has expanded; however, retrospective reports in this setting are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic balloon dilatation combined with stent deployment for HJAS.
METHODS: This was a single-arm prospective clinical trial involving 40 patients with treatment-naïve HJAS enrolled between March 2016 and August 2019 at four endoscopy units in Japan. For HJAS, plastic stents combined with balloon dilatation were placed for 6 months after initial stenting. The primary outcome was HJ anastomosis patency 12 months after stent removal.
RESULTS: The technical success rate was 97.5% (39/40). The failed case required percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage using the rendezvous technique. All cases achieved successful endoscopic treatment. During the treatment period, four of 40 patients (10%) ended the study protocol due to unrelated causes and were excluded from the primary analysis. Among the 36 patients, clinical success was achieved in 34 (94.4%) patients. The remaining two patients achieved HJAS resolution after an additional 3 months. All 36 patients achieved HJAS resolution. Adverse events were observed in two patients (5.0%) who developed moderate cholangitis. During a median follow-up of 21.3 months, HJAS recurrence was observed in 8.3% (3/36) with a median time to recurrence of 4.3 months and HJ anastomosis patency at 12 months was 94.4%.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic balloon dilatation combined with plastic stent deployment for 6 months was a safe and effective strategy for HJAS. (Clinical Trial Registry no. UMIN000020613).
