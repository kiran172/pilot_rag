Title: Long-term outcomes of transapical-transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Transapical-transcatheter aortic valve replacement is one of the main interventions indicated for patients where access via peripheral vessels is challenging. However, there have been no reports on the long-term outcomes of this intervention. Here, we report the long-term outcomes of this intervention.
METHODS: Among 178 patients who underwent transapical-transcatheter aortic valve replacement between October 2009 and July 2023, 173 patients who underwent this intervention for native aortic stenosis were included in this study, and early and long-term results were evaluated.
RESULTS: The mean age was 82.4 ± 6.4 years, 52.6% were women, mean body area was 1.46 ± 0.17 m2, and the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality was 11.2 ± 9.9%. In-hospital mortality was observed in three patients (1.7%). Mean follow-up duration was 4.3 ± 2.8 years, and the survival rates at 1-, 3-, 5-, and 8-years were 84.9%, 67.1%, 47.0%, and 22.1%, respectively. Freedom from cardiovascular mortality at 1, 3, 5, and 8-years was 92.9%, 86.1%, 75.8%, and 53.5%, respectively. The freedom from disabling stroke rates at 1, 3, 5, and 8-years were 95.0%, 92.4%, 92.4%, and 90.8%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that male (Hazard Ratio 1.85, 95%Confidence Interval 1.27-2.70, p = 0.0012) and hemodialysis (Hazard Ratio 1.64, 95%Confidence Interval 1.00-2.67, p = 0.049) were significant poor prognosis factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term outcomes of transapical-transcatheter aortic valve replacement were satisfactory. Despite the variety of available approaches, the role of transapical-transcatheter aortic valve replacement, which has low vascular impact, has not been completely lost.
