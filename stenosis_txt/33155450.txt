Title: [Exploration of urethral strictures : place of urethrocystography].

Abstract: Stricture of the male urethra is a frequent and regularly iatrogenic pathology in industrialized countries. The urologist's surgical arsenal is wide and the choice of an operative technique is made at the end of an assessment where urethrocystography is the main radiological examination. The conditions to achieve the examination, its different stages, the normal aspects and anatomical variants as well as the limitations to its interpretation, should therefore be known by the urologist and the radiologist, in order to assess correctly this pathology.
