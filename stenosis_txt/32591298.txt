Title: High-Risk Airway Management in the Emergency Department: Diseases and Approaches, Part II.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Successful airway management is critical to the practice of emergency medicine. Thus, emergency physicians must be ready to optimize and prepare for airway management in critically ill patients with a wide range of physiologic challenges. Challenges in airway management commonly encountered in the emergency department are discussed using a pearl and pitfall discussion in this second part of a 2-part series.
OBJECTIVE: This narrative review presents an evidence-based approach to airway and patient management during endotracheal intubation in challenging cases commonly encountered in the emergency department.
DISCUSSION: Adverse events during emergent airway management are common with postintubation cardiac arrest, reported in as many as 1 in 25 intubations. Many of these adverse events can be avoided by proper identification and understanding the underlying physiology, preparation, and postintubation management. Those with high-risk features including trauma, elevated intracranial pressure, upper gastrointestinal bleed, cardiac tamponade, aortic stenosis, morbid obesity, and pregnancy must be managed with airway expertise.
CONCLUSIONS: This narrative review discusses the pearls and pitfalls of commonly encountered physiologic high-risk intubations with a focus on the emergency clinician.
