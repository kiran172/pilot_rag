Title: Intraoperative Transesophageal Echocardiography for Coronary Artery Assessment.

Abstract: Background: In surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR), coronary arteries are routinely assessed by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) to prevent undesirable complications. This study evaluated the capabilities and pitfalls of TEE assessment. Methods and Results: Of 147 consecutive SAVR patients undergoing aortic stenosis, the TEE records for 130 patients, in which the procedures were conducted by a single examiner, were analyzed retrospectively regarding data acquisition and the accuracy of detecting an anomalous origin, high or low takeoff, ostial diameter, and short left main truncus (LMT). The left and right coronary arteries could be visualized in every patient. A left coronary ostium &gt;5 mm was found in 33 patients (25.4%). TEE revealed an anomalous origin in 2 patients (1.5%) that had not been diagnosed, but missed it in another patient. High takeoff was noted in 11 patients (8.3%), often associated with aortic disease necessitating aortic repair. In one such patient, occlusion of the right coronary artery was detected, necessitating coronary revascularization. Short LMT was found in 15 patients (11.8%) but misdiagnosed due to artifact in 1. During selective cardioplegia, malperfusion of the left anterior descending artery due to deep cannula placement was detected. Conclusions: TEE provides fairly accurate assessment in SAVR, including detection of undiagnosed pathologies or pitfalls related to coronary arteries, although misdiagnosis due to artifacts should be kept in mind.
