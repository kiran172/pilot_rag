Title: Modified Gant procedure for treatment of internal rectal prolapse in elderly women.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although rectal prolapse is not a life-threatening condition, it can cause defecation disorders, anal incontinence, sensory abnormalities, and other problems that can seriously affect quality of life.
AIM: To study the efficacy of the modified Gant procedure for elderly women with internal rectal prolapse.
METHODS: Sixty-three elderly female patients with internal rectal prolapse underwent the modified Gant procedure. The preoperative and postoperative anal symptoms, Patient Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL), Wexner incontinence score, incontinence quality of life score, and complications (massive hemorrhage, infection, anorectal stenosis, and anorectal fistula) were compared.
RESULTS: The improvement rates of postoperative symptoms were defecation disorders (84.5%), anal distention (69.6%), defecation sensation (81.4%), frequent defecation (88.7%), and anal incontinence (42.9%) (P &lt; 0.05). All dimensions and total scores of the PAC-QOL after the procedure were lower than those before the operation (P &lt; 0.05). The postoperative anal incontinence score and Wexner score were significantly lower than those before the procedure (P &lt; 0.05). The quality of life and total scores of postoperative anal incontinence were significantly higher than those before the procedure (P &lt; 0.05). There were no serious complications and no deaths.
CONCLUSION: The modified Gant procedure has significant advantages in the treatment of elderly women with internal rectal prolapse.
