Title: Effect of Reconstructive Procedures of the Extracranial Segment of the Carotid Arteries on Damage to the Blood-Brain Barrier.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endarterectomy and angioplasty of the internal carotid artery are surgical measures for the prevention of ischemic stroke. Perioperative complications are caused by concomitant embolism and reperfusion syndrome leading to damage of the blood-brain barrier.
METHODS: The study included 88 patients divided into two groups, depending on the surgical technique used: internal carotid artery endarterectomy (CEA), 66 patients, and percutaneous carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS), 22 patients. Blood was drawn 24 h before surgery, as well as 8, 24, and 48 h post-surgery. The assessment of damage to the blood-brain barrier was based on the evaluation of the concentration of claudin-1 and occludin, aquaporin-4, the measurements of the activity of metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9), and the assessment of central nervous system damage, measured by changes in the blood S100Î² protein concentration.
RESULTS: A significant increase in the concentration of the blood-brain barrier damage markers and increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity were found in patient blood. The degree of damage to the blood-brain barrier was higher in the CEA group.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors' own research has indicated that revascularization of the internal carotid artery may lead to damage to the central nervous system secondary to damage to the blood-brain barrier.
