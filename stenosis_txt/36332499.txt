Title: Predictors of 1-Year Mortality in Men Versus Women Undergoing Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Although gender-related disparities in intermediate-term outcomes have been reported after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), disparate predictors of mortality in men and women who underwent TAVI have not been well studied. This prospective institutional registry study included 297 consecutive patients (153 men, 144 women) who underwent transfemoral TAVI from December 2015 to June 2018 at an academic tertiary medical center. Baseline and clinical characteristics, procedural data, and clinical outcomes at 1 year were recorded. Mortality rates at 1 year were 11.1% and 20.3% in women and men, respectively (p = 0.033). Risk-adjusted mortality was significantly higher in men who underwent TAVI than in women (odds ratio [OR] 2.45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24 to 4.87, p = 0.010). Gender-specific risk-adjusted predictors of 1-year mortality post-TAVI included the presence of atrial fibrillation (OR 4.20, 95% CI 1.31 to 13.46, p = 0.016) and peripheral artery disease (OR 4.64, 95% CI 1.04 to 20.71, p = 0.044) in women and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.13 to 8.72, p = 0.029), higher serum creatinine (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.15 to 2.15, p = 0.004), and lower body mass index (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.97, p = 0.008) in men. In this prospective institutional registry of adults who underwent TAVI, risk-adjusted 1-year mortality is significantly lower in women, and disparate predictors of risk-adjusted 1-year mortality exist in men and women.
