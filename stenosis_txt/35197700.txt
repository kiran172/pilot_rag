Title: Modified snodgrass hypospadias repair using the lembert suturing technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical repair of hypospadias deformity is a challenging and complex issue. However, the technique of Snodgrass and its modifications attend promising functional and cosmetic results.
PURPOSE: To assess the Lembert suturing technique effectiveness as a modification of the Snodgrass technique in lowering an urethrocutanous fistula rate.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty boys with mid-shaft and distal hypospadias were repaired using the modified Snodgrass technique utilizing the interrupted Lembert suturing technique in neourethroplasty. Patients with previous failed operations or severe chordee were excluded from the study.
RESULTS: None of the patients develops UCF apart from one who developed complete wound dehiscence following severe wound infection. Mild meatal stenosis is seen in two patients, and one patient experienced a small area of superficial skin sloughing.
