Title: First transaortic transcatheter aortic valve implantation with Acurate Neo: case report and technical recommendations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In more than 90%, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is performed via transfemoral access. Alternative access routes are necessary for patients with unfavourable femoral arteries.
CASE SUMMARY: We report of a 68-year-old female with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in whom surgical aortic valve replacement was prohibited due to her severe co-morbidities. Both femoral arteries and both subclavian arteries were unsuitable for TAVI access. Surgical aortic valve replacement and transapical TAVI were deferred due to extremely high operative risk and very low originating left coronary artery of 7â€…mm from the annulus. Hence, we decided to implant a self-expanding TAVI device with a low risk of coronary obstruction (Acurate Neo 2 prosthesis) via transaortic approach, which to our knowledge is the first case worldwide.
CONCLUSION: The present case demonstrates the feasibility of implanting the Acurate Neo 2 system via transaortic approach when certain key points are respected. Transaortic TAVI with the Acurate Neo 2 offers a minimally invasive treatment of high operative risk patients with low originating coronary arteries.
