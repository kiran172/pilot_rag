Title: Utility of cervical dynamic magnetic resonance imaging for evaluating patients with cervical myelopathy: a retrospective study.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective observational study.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the utility of cervical dynamic magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) in the assessment of cervical canal stenosis.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Cervical spondylotic myelopathy has been intricately linked to both static and dynamic narrowing of the cervical spinal canal. Traditional MRI with the neck in a neutral position fails to identify the dynamic changes and may lead to misdiagnosis. Cervical dMRI is a promising tool for evaluating cervical myelopathy, enabling clinicians to assess spinal cord compression, segmental instability, and alterations in range of motion, often missed on conventional imaging.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 369 patients with symptoms of cervical myelopathy assessed using cervical dMRI. After assessing the subaxial cervical spine at each disc level (C3-T1), significant changes in the degree of central canal stenosis were determined. The appearance and extent of hyperintense lesions on T2-weighted sequences were also noted.
RESULTS: Overall, 653/1,845 (35.39%) disc levels showed an increase in stenosis grade on extension MRI, with 168/653 (25.72%) and 180/653 (27.56%) disc levels changing from grades 0/1 to grades 2 and 3, respectively. Moreover, 120/369 (32.52%) patients showed a mean increase of 1.55Â±0.75 levels of compression on extension MRI when compared to neutral MRI. A fresh-appearing hyperintense lesion was observed in 79 (4.28%) disc levels on flexion MRI, which was not visualized on neutral MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical dMRI may help surgeons plan for surgery, discuss the prognosis with the patient, and safeguard themselves from medico-legal issues arising from improper or missed diagnosis and treatment.
