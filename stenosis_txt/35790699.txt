Title: Worsened Fibrostenotic Outcomes in Eosinophilic Esophagitis Patients Due to COVID-19-Related Endoscopy Cancellations.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Indirect consequences of COVID-19 in eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) are not known.
AIM: To determine the impact of COVID-19-related endoscopy cancellations on outcomes in EoE patients.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we assessed whether adult EoE patients who had routine endoscopy scheduled from mid-March 2020 to May 2020 (pandemic start) were canceled or proceeded, and if canceled, ultimately returned. We extracted clinical, endoscopic, and histologic data for their pre-COVID procedure as well as the next procedure performed, if a patient returned. Outcomes included histologic response (< 15 eos/hpf) and endoscopic severity. Those with delayed care were compared to those who returned as scheduled.
RESULTS: Of 102 patients identified, 75 had procedures canceled, and 20 (27%) never returned. For the 55 who were canceled but returned, mean time between procedures was 1.1 ± 0.7 years with a delay of 0.5 ± 0.3 years. While treatment rates were similar between the pre- and delayed post-COVID EGD, more patients required a dilation after their return (71% vs 58%; p = 0.05) and their esophageal diameter had significantly decreased (16.8 mm to 15.0 mm; p < 0.001). Of 17 individuals who did not have stricture, narrowing, or dilation pre-pandemic, during their next endoscopy 5 (29%) had a stricture, 1 (6%) had a narrowing, and 7 (41%) required dilation.
CONCLUSION: Of EoE patients with canceled endoscopies during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, > 25% never returned for care, which is a previously unmeasured impact of the pandemic. Those who returned had > 1 year between procedures with progression of fibrotic features and need for esophageal dilation.
