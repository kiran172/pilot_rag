Title: Accurate location and minimally invasive treatment of lumbar lateral recess stenosis with combined SNRB and PTED.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To establish a management strategy for multi-segment lumbar lateral recess stenosis.
METHODS: A retrospective study was performed in patients in whom suspected responsible nerve roots underwent sequential selective nerve root block (SNRB). Based on pain remission rate after blocking, the contribution of nerve root compression to symptoms was classified as absolutely (≥70%) or relatively (30-70%) responsible or non-responsible (<30%). Conservative treatment was continued if visual analogue scale (VAS) at 3 days after blocking a single nerve root or VAS at 3 days after blocking multiple nerve roots was ≥50%; otherwise, percutaneous transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) was performed. Pain and functional scores were evaluated on day 3, 6 months and 1 year after SNRB or PTED.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven of 80 patients had a single absolutely responsible root, 20 had 2 responsible roots, and 3 had 3 responsible roots. Among them, 41, 10, and 1 patient underwent PTED, respectively. Both the PTED and conservative groups improved significantly in VAS remission rate and functional scores compared with admission. Moreover, the PTED group had a better VAS remission rate compared with the conservative group.
CONCLUSION: A combination of SNRB with PTED was effective for diagnosing and treating multi-segment lumbar lateral recess stenosis.
