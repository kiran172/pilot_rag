Title: Tracheobronchopathia Osteochondroplastica: A Rare, Underrecognized Entity.

Abstract: Tracheobronchopathia Osteochondroplastica (TO) is an extremely rare condition characterized by the presence of nodules made of bone and cartilage within the submucosa of the tracheobronchial wall. These protuberant nodules inside the trachea and bronchi can lead to airway obstruction, resulting in patients who experience recurrent respiratory systems and infections. The exact etiology is unknown. The mean age of diagnosis is in the 5th - 6th decades of life. TO is often confused with other diagnoses, especially asthma. We report a 41-year-old female who presented with intermittent exertional dyspnea for 10 years. Workups, including pulmonary function test, CT chest, and most importantly, flexible bronchoscopy, aided in the appropriate diagnosis. The unique feature observed during bronchoscopy is the sparing of the posterior wall of the trachea and bronchi.
