Title: [Skiing Accident with Temporary Tetraparesis].

Abstract: Skiing Accident with Temporary Tetraparesis Abstract. Summary: We present the case of a 74-year-old patient who initially suffered transient tetraplegia after a skiing accident. On presentation to the general practitioner, pyramidal tract signs as well as disturbances of fine motor function in both hands could be observed. MRI examinations of the cervical spine revealed high-grade spinal stenosis at level C5 with myelon compression. Surgical decompression of the spial cord, followed by fusion of the corresponding cervical vertebral bodies, was performed. After surgery and three weeks of neurological rehabilitation, the patient feels well and has recovered except for still existing hypesthesia of the fingertips.
