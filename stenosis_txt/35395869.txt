Title: Impact of wait times on late postprocedural mortality after successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Wait times are associated with mortality on waiting list for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Whether longer wait times are associated with long term mortality after successful TAVR remains unassessed. Consecutive patients successfully treated with elective TAVR in our center between January 2013 and August 2019 were included. The primary end point was one-year all-cause mortality. TAVR wait times were defined as the interval from referral date for valve replacement to the date of TAVR procedure. A total of 383 patients were included with a mean wait time of 144.2 ± 83.87 days. Death occurred in 55 patients (14.4%) at one year. Increased wait times were independently associated with a relative increase of 1-year mortality by 2% per week after referral (Adjusted Hazard Ratio 1.02 [1.002-1.04]; p = 0.02) for TAVR. Chronic kidney disease, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤ 30%, access site and STS score were other independent correlates of 1-year mortality. Our study shows that wait times are relatively long in routine practice and associated with increased 1-year mortality after successful TAVR. Such findings underscore the need of strategies to minimize delays in access to TAVR.
