Title: Diagnostic value of computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging to detect coexisting microvascular dysfunction in patients with obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Computed tomography myocardial perfusion (CT-MP) has reported usefulness in assessing hemodynamically significant epicardial coronary artery lesions. However, the diagnostic ability of the absolute coronary flow using CT-MP to detect coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) remains elusive. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess the diagnostic value of CT-MP in evaluating coexisting CMD in patients with functionally significant epicardial coronary stenosis and to analyze the predictive factors of lesions with CMD.
METHODS: Sixty-eight patients with chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) and de novo single functionally significant stenosis [fractional flow reserve (FFR) ≤0.80] were studied. CMD was defined as an index of microcirculatory resistance ≥25. We compare clinical background and CT-MP findings between patients with and without CMD (CMD, n=29; non-CMD, n=39). CT-MP, and quantitative and qualitative plaque assessments were included in computed tomography angiography assessment. Logistic regression analysis was performed to predict CMD.
RESULTS: FFR, invasive wire-derived coronary flow reserve (CFR<sub>wire</sub>) and index of microcirculatory resistance were 0.68 [interquartile range (IQR), 0.59-0.74], 1.71 (IQR, 1.24-2.88), and 22.6 (IQR, 15.1-34.5), respectively. The rest and hyperemic-myocardial blood flow (MBF) and CT-MP-derived CFR (CFR<sub>CT-MP</sub>) were 0.83 (0.64-1.03) mL/min/g, 2.14 (1.30-2.92) mL/min/g, and 2.19 (1.44-3.37), respectively. In the territories with CMD, hyperemic-MBF was significantly lower than in those without [1.68 (IQR, 0.84-2.44) vs. 2.31 (IQR, 1.67-3.34) mL/min/g, P=0.015] and the prevalence of CFR<sub>CT-MP</sub> &lt;2.0 was higher in the lesions with CMD than in those without (62.1% vs. 28.2%, P=0.011), while FFR values were similar. Fibrofatty and necrotic core component volume was greater in the vessels with CMD than in those without [31.8 (IQR, 19.0-48.9) vs. 25.1 (IQR, 17.2-32.1) mm3, P=0.045]. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that hyperemic-MBF and fibrofatty and necrotic core component volume were independent predictors of CMD territories [odds ratio (OR) =0.583; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.355-0.958; P=0.033 and OR =1.040; 95% CI: 1.010-1.070; P=0.011].
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative assessment of absolute coronary flow using pre-percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) CT-MP, and comprehensive plaque analysis using computed tomography angiography may help detect coexisting subtended microvascular dysfunction in territories with functionally significant epicardial coronary lesions. Further studies are required to elucidate the clinical significance of coexisting CMD in patients with CCS undergoing PCI.
