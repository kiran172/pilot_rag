Title: Size of Self-Expandable Transcatheter Heart Valve and Mid-Term Adverse Events After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: The hemodynamic performance of self-expandable valves (SEVs) is a preferable choice for small aortic annuli in transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, no data are, so far, available regarding the relation between the size of SEVs and clinical outcomes. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of prosthesis size on adverse events after TAVR using SEVs. We retrospectively analyzed 1,400 patients (23-mm SEV: 13.6%) who underwent TAVR using SEVs at 12 centers. The impact of SEV size on all-cause death and heart failure (HF) after TAVR was evaluated by multivariate Cox regression and propensity score (PS) matching analysis. During the follow-up period (median 511 days), 201 all-cause deaths and 87 HF rehospitalizations were observed. The incidence of all-cause death was comparable between small- (23-mm SEV) and larger-sized (26- or 29-mm SEV) (16.8% vs 13.9%, log-rank p = 0.29). The size of SEV was not associated with a higher incidence of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79 to 1.86 in Cox regression; HR 1.31, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.23 in PS matching) and HF after TAVR (subdistribution HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.72 in Cox regression; subdistribution HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.30 in PS matching). The multivariate model including postprocedural prosthesis-patient mismatch showed consistent results. In conclusion, small SEVs had comparable midterm clinical outcomes to larger-sized SEVs, even if the prosthesis-patient mismatch was observed after TAVR.
