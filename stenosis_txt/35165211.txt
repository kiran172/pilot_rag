Title: Surgical management of complex neonatal airway abnormalities.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The neonatal airway is subject to a variety of developmental abnormalities with a wide range of complexity. Symptomatic pathologies present in a spectrum ranging from simple noisy breathing or poor feeding to frank respiratory distress. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion, characterization of noisy breathing, and identification of obstructive symptoms such as increased work of breathing, retractions, and difficulty feeding. Surgical management is directed by the pathology.
RECENT FINDINGS: The past several years have seen an expansion of surgical innovation as endoscopic and open techniques have evolved. We reviewed articles related to neonatal and infant airway diagnoses since 2020 with the goal of providing a current review and update of developing techniques. Specifically, we discuss some of the exciting trends in surgical management of vocal fold paralysis, laryngeal clefts, subglottic stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia as well as the role of ex utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT procedures).
SUMMARY: An underlying theme in evolving surgical management is the exciting advancements in technology, including 3-D printing, and expansion of minimally invasive endoscopic techniques. Though some of these developments are in the initial stages of utilization, they may be potential sources to transform surgical management in the future.
