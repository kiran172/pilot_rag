Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation for Failed Surgical Aortic Bioprostheses Using a Self-Expanding Device (from the Prospective VIVA Post Market Study).

Abstract: Patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis are often treated with a surgical valve replacement. Surgical bioprosthetic valves degenerate over time and therefore may necessitate a redo surgery. This analysis reports the 2-year clinical outcomes of the Valve-in-Valve study, which evaluated transcatheter aortic valve implantation using the CoreValve and Evolut R devices in patients with degenerated surgical aortic bioprostheses at high risk for surgery. The prospective Valve-in-Valve study enrolled 202 eligible patients with failing surgical aortic bioprostheses due to stenosis, regurgitation, or a combination of both. The Evolut R bioprosthesis was used in 90.5% of valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve implantation cases. Two-year all-cause and cardiovascular mortality rates were 16.5% and 11.1%, respectively. Other clinical events included stroke (7.9%), disabling stroke (1.7%), and new pacemaker implantation (10.1%). The 2-year all-cause mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with discharge mean gradients ≥20 mmHg vs. those with lower mean gradients (21.0% vs 7.6%, p = 0.025). Discharge mean gradients ≥20 mm Hg were associated with smaller surgical bioprostheses (OR, 7.2 [95% CI 2.3 to 22.1]. In patients with failing surgical aortic bioprostheses, valve-in-valve treatment using a supra-annular self-expanding bioprosthesis provides significant functional improvements with acceptable rates of complications, especially if a postprocedural mean gradient of <20 mmHg can be achieved.
