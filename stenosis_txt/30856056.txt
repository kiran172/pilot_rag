Title: TAVR-related echocardiographic assessment - status quo, challenges and perspectives.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an emerging and a well-established procedure for high-risk and inoperable patients worldwide. Recent studies revealed furthermore that TAVR is equal or even superior to surgical valve replacement in intermediate risk patients. Therefore, a successful procedure is not only dependent on precise preprocedural patient selection but also on careful intraprocedural multimodal imaging guidance and adequate postprocedural follow-up. Up to date, 2D/3D transthoracic and/or transoesophageal echocardiography is an easy and goal-oriented tool for periprocedural TAVR-assessment regarding annulus measurements, cardiac function and concomitant valve diseases. Further procedural success is directly related to prevention of severe early and late complications. Thus, a careful intra- and postprocedural echocardiographic guidance is crucial to evaluate prosthetic function, position and its haemodynamic implication and changes in the integrity of the left ventricle during intra- and postprocedural management. We explored the role of echocardiography for pre-, intra- and postprocedural TAVR-assessment, illustrated by cases and possible algorithms, in a comprehensive literature review. Furthermore, we describe the role of fusion imaging, that is, real-time fusion of transoesophageal echocardiography and fluoroscopy (EchoNavigator Release SystemÂ® I and II) during TAVR.
