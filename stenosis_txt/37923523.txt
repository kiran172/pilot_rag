Title: Effect of Abdominal Compression on Total Single-Balloon Enteroscopy Rate: A Randomized Controlled Trial.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether abdominal compression significantly increased the total enteroscopy rate in single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE).
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent SBE at 2 hospitals were prospectively included between June 1, 2020, and September 30, 2021. They were randomly divided into an abdominal compression group and a non-abdominal compression group with use of sealed envelopes generated by a computer. Total enteroscopy rates were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: The study included 200 patients. The total enteroscopy rates were 73% and 16% in the abdominal compression and non-abdominal compression groups, respectively (relative risk, 13.55; 95% CI, 6.79 to 27.00; P<.001). The total enteroscopy rate was higher in the 70 patients who were identified to have undergone no previous abdominal surgery or small intestinal stenosis than in the 32 patients who had undergone such procedures in the abdominal compression group (84% vs 47%; relative risk, 6.08; 95% CI, 2.36 to 15.67; P<.001). Relevant positive findings were not significantly different between the groups (58% vs 45%; P=.07). Binary logistic regression analysis found abdominal compression to be associated with a better total enteroscopy rate (odds ratio, 16.68; 95% CI, 7.92 to 35.15; P<.001), and the presence of previous abdominal surgery or small intestinal stenosis was associated with difficulty in completing the total enteroscopy procedure (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.58; P<.01).
CONCLUSION: Abdominal compression significantly increased the total enteroscopy rate in SBE. Complete total enteroscopy may be challenging in patients with a history of abdominal surgery or small intestinal stenosis.
