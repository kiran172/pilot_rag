Title: Reversal of the reversed 'Robin Hood syndrome' after superficial temporal-Middle cerebral artery bypass for severe intracranial stenosis.

Abstract: Background: Intracranial arterial stenosis is a common cause of ischemic stroke. Recent attempts with intracranial stenting and superficial temporal-middle cerebral artery (STA-MCA) bypass failed to show benefit. Perhaps, better strategies are needed for selecting suitable patients. Acetazolamide-challenged single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) can demonstrate reversed Robin Hood syndrome (RRHS) due to intracranial steal phenomenon and identify high-risk patients.Methods: We describe the clinical and SPECT findings of RRHS.Results: In our patient with severe and symptomatic severe stenosis of the right MCA, STA-MCA bypass resulted in complete resolution of RRHS.Conclusion: STA-MCA bypass surgery should be considered a possible option in patients with severe stenosis of intracranial internal carotid artery or MCA in carefully selected patients.
