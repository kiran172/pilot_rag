Title: Clinical outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement stratified by left ventricular ejection fraction: A single centre pilot study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To define baseline echocardiographic, electrocardiographic (ECG) and computed tomographic (CT) findings of patients with heart failure undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and analyze their overall procedural outcomes.
METHODS: Between 2018 and 2021, patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who performed transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in Sabah Al Ahmad Cardiac Centre, Al Amiri Hospital were identified. A retrospective review of patients' parameters including pre-, intra-, and post-procedural data was conducted. Patients were grouped in 2 subgroups according to their EF: EF <40% (HFrEF) and EF ≥ 40%. The data included patients' baseline characteristics, electrocardiographic and echocardiographic details along with pre-procedural CT assessment of aortic valve dimensions. Primary outcomes including post-operative disturbances, pacemaker implantation and in-hospital mortality following TAVR were additionally analyzed.
RESULTS: A total of 61 patients with severe AS underwent TAVR. The mean age was 73.5 ± 9, and 21 (34%) of the patients were males. The mean ejection fraction (EF) was 55.5 ± 9.7%. Of 61 patients, 12 (20%) were identified as heart failure with reduced EF (<40%). These patients were younger, more often males, and were more likely to have coronary artery disease (75% versus 53.1%). Left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction was documented in 75% and 58.3% of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) respectively. Post TAVR conduction disturbances, with the commonest being LBBB was observed in 41.7%. Permanent pacemaker was implanted in 3 of patients with HFrEF (25%). There were no significant differences between the two groups with regards to in hospital mortality (p = 0.618).
CONCLUSION: Severe AS with EF <40% constitute a remarkable proportion of patients undergoing TAVR. Preliminary results of post-operative conduction disturbances and in hospital mortality in HFrEF patients were concluded to not differ from patients with LVEF ≥40%.
