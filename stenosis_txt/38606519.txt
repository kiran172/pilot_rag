Title: What are the short- and long-term abdominal consequences of an omentectomy? A systematic review.

Abstract: This review provides an overview regarding the abdominal effects of an omentectomy, with or without extra-peritoneal reconstructions. In general, reported complication rates were low. Short-term complications involved ileus, bowel stenosis, abdominal abscess and sepsis (range 0.0%-23%). Donor-site hernia was mainly reported as long-term complication (up to 32%) and negligible gastrointestinal complications were observed. However, the level of evidence and methodological quality are quite low with a maximum of 8.5 years follow-up.
