Title: Successful percutaneous treatment of late outflow graft failure of the left ventricular assist device: a long-term follow-up.

Abstract: Continuous flow left ventricular assist device (LVAD) outflow graft stenosis constitutes a severe complication. Treatment options include surgical pump exchange, transcatheter procedures, or systemic thrombolysis. We present a case of a spontaneous mechanical twisting of the outflow graft at two distinct points, which was treated by a two-step percutaneous stent implantation. Self-expanding stents were used during the first procedure. We also ensured distal bilateral percutaneous neuroprotection against cerebrovascular embolism. During the second, previously unpredicted procedure, we used balloon-expandable bare-metal stents to overcome the torque of the graft, because of their higher radial force. It was assumed that the external, self-expanding layer of the stent might protect the graft from the bare-metal stents. The effects of the treatment were monitored both clinically and through computed tomography angiography. The check-up 12Â months later revealed nothing of note. Interventional transcatheter procedures are a safe treatment option for outflow graft stenosis, with good long-term effects. Both self-expanding and balloon-expandable stents can be used for transcatheter intervention. Both the incidence of the graft twisting and the radial force of the implanted stent seem to be critical and robust predictors of the long-term result of percutaneous therapy.
