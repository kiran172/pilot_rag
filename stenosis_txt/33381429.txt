Title: T1 mapping and feature tracking imaging of left ventricular extracellular remodeling in severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) extracellular remodeling is a critical process in aortic stenosis (AS), which is related to functional abnormalities. Data regarding the use of combined T1 mapping and feature tracking (FT) to assess LV extracellular remodeling in severe AS are scarce. This study aimed to investigate the ability of T1-derived and FT-derived parameters to identify and assess the changes in process of LV extracellular remodeling in patients with severe AS.
METHODS: A total of 49 patients with severe AS and 20 healthy volunteers were prospectively recruited. Modified look-locker inversion-recovery T1 mapping and FT imaging were performed in all participants using 3.0-T cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. The degree of myocardial fibrosis was quantified using Masson trichrome stain in biopsy specimens obtained intraoperatively from 13 patients and expressed as collagen volume fraction (CVF). Patients were divided into subgroups according to preserved LV ejection fraction (LVEF) (LVEF ≥50%) or reduced LVEF (LVEF <50%).
RESULTS: Regarding the diffuse fibrosis burden, extracellular volume (ECV) was statistically insignificant between patients with preserved LVEF) and controls (28.0%±3.3% vs. 26.5%±2.3%, P&gt;0.05). ECV in the reduced LVEF group (n=20) was significantly higher than that in the preserved LVEF group (n=29) (30.4%±3.9% vs. 28.0%±3.3%, P&lt;0.05). Regarding the myocardial strain, global longitudinal strain (GLS) showed increasing impairment from the control group to the preserved LVEF AS group to the reduced LVEF AS group (-23.4%±3.3% vs. -18.6%±3.8% vs. -11.2%±4.8%, P&lt;0.05). A significant correlation was found between ECV and CVF (r=0.64, P=0.020), whereas the correlation between GLS and CVF was insignificant. Significant correlations were observed between GLS and LV mass index (r=0.72, P=0.006) and LVEF (r=0.82, P&lt;0.001). However, no correlations were found between ECV and LV mass index (P=0.172) and between ECV and LVEF (P=0.339). Discrimination of patients with preserved LVEF from controls, GLS yielded the best diagnostic performance as defined by the area of under the curve (-0.83), and GLS, ECV, and post-T1 were significant discriminators after regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: In the process of LV extracellular remodeling in severe AS, ECV is the structural marker of extracellular fibrosis burden, and GLS is the functional marker before the fibrosis burden intensifies.
