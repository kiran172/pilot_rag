Title: Left Atrial Hypertension and Respiratory Failure Requiring Venoarterial ECMO After Transcatheter Pulmonary Valve Replacement.

Abstract: A 33-year-old woman with aortic valve stenosis status-post Ross at age 6 years developed symptomatic right heart failure from right ventricle to pulmonary artery conduit stenosis. Conduit rehabilitation and transcatheter pulmonary valve replacement resulted in acute left atrial hypertension and respiratory failure requiring venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and atrial septal defect creation as a bridge to recovery.
