Title: Risk Factors Associated With de Quervain Tenosynovitis in Postpartum Women.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: De Quervain (DQ) disease is caused by stenosis of the first dorsal compartment containing the abductor pollicis longus and extensor pollicis brevis. This condition affects women 6 times more than men and is also commonly reported in pregnant and lactating women. The natural course of the disease and associated risk factors are not well understood. In this study, we described the gestational risk factors associated with postpartum DQ.
METHODS: Sixty-three postpartum women with DQ were included in final study population. Medical records were reviewed for patient characteristics, including age, comorbidities, and body mass index (BMI), and gestational information, including length of pregnancy, gestation number, single or twin birth, and weight at birth. Odds ratio (OR) for developing DQ tenosynovitis were calculated with the control group of 630 postpartum women without DQ who gave birth between 2012 and 2020 in the same district.
RESULTS: Length of pregnancy (>40 weeks, OR = 5.81 [3.29-10.28]), first childbirth (OR = 2.23 [1.32-3.77]), and weight (BMI > 25, OR = 2.08 [1.14-3.81]) were all statistically significant risk factors associated with developing DQ. Number of fetuses > 1 (OR = 0.98 [0.29-3.33]) and birth weight more than 3.5 kg (OR = 0.60 [0.30-1.21]) were not associated with higher risk of DQ.
CONCLUSIONS: Gestational risk factors associated with developing postpartum DQ include first pregnancy and long pregnancy of more than 40 weeks. Interestingly, child's birthweight and number of fetuses, both factors that might increase load on the first dorsal compartment while holding the child, were not shown to increase the risk of postpartum DQ.
