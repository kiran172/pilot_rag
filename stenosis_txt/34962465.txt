Title: Pulmonary Artery Sling with Tracheal Stenosis Combined with A Large Ventricular Septal Defect in A Two-Month-Old Boy: A Case Report.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery sling (PAS) is a rare congenital cardiovascular abnormality. In typical PAS patients, the left pulmonary artery (LPA) arises from the right pulmonary artery and passes between the trachea and esophagus, which possibly causes tracheal stenosis and some respiratory symptoms. PAS typically associates with other cardiovascular anomalies, which may cause difficulties to the treatment of patients. This report described a rare case of a two-month-old boy with PAS, VSD, and tracheal stenosis simultaneously and underwent procedures without tracheoplasty.
