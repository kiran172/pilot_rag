Title: Correlation between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and coronary atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Various non-invasive methods have been studied for assessing the severity of fatty liver disease and coronary atherosclero-sis. However, the correlation between hepatic steatosis and coronary atherosclerosis has not been fully studied, either globally or specifically in Vietnam. This study investigated the association between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and coronary atherosclerosis using coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA).
METHODS: An analytical cross-sectional study was performed, including 223 patients treated by the Cardiology Department, the Emergency Interventional Cardiology Departments, and the Internal Cardiology Clinic of Thong Nhat Hospital.
RESULTS: In our cohort of 223 patients, the NAFLD was detected in 66% of the population, the mean coronary artery stenosis (CAS) was 44.54% ± 20.23%, and the mean coronary artery calcium score (CACS) was 3569.05 ± 425.99, as assessed using the Agatston method. The proportion of patients with significant atherosclerotic plaque (CAS 50%) >was 32%, whereas the remaining 68% had insignificant stenosis. Among our study population, 16% had no coronary artery calcification, 38% had mild calcification, and 46% had moderate to severe calcification. In the group of NAFLD patients, 33.3% had significant atherosclerotic plaque, which was not significantly different from the rate in individuals without NAFLD (p = 0.51). Mild coronary artery calcification was detected in 37.4% of NAFLD patients, and moderate to severe calcification was detected in 48.3% (p = 0.45).
CONCLUSIONS: NAFLD was not found to be strongly associated with coronary atherosclerosis in this study. More studies with larger sample sizes remain necessary to verify whether any correlation exists.
