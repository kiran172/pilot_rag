Title: [Observation of the efficacy of autologous mucosal transplantation to prevent esophageal stricture after near-circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection for early esophageal cancer].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the efficacy of autologous mucosal transplantation to prevent esophageal stricture after near-circumferential endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early esophageal cancer. Methods: The case data of 33 patients, who underwent near-circumferential ESD for early esophageal cancer and were followed up regularly in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from April 2017 to July 2022, were analyzed retrospectively, including 14 males and 19 females, aged (66.4Â±7.4) (47-77) years. According to the different treatment methods, they were divided into 4 groups: group A (6 cases) were treated with autologous mucosa transplantation and fully covered metal stent implantation, combined with oral, intravenous and local injection of hormone; Group B (8 cases) were treated with autologous mucosa transplantation and fully covered metal stent implantation; Group C (11 cases) were treated with fully covered metal stent implantation combined with oral or intravenous hormone; Group D (8 cases) were treated with fully covered metal stent implantation. After the operation, the growth of the transplanted mucosa, esophageal stricture and surgical complications were observed by endoscopy, so as to understand the efficacy of automucosa transplantation in preventing esophageal stricture after near-circumferential ESD for early esophageal cancer. Results: The gastroscopic operation was successful in 33 patients. The times of expansion in groups B, C and D were more than that in group A, and the times of expansion [M(Q<sub>1</sub>,Q<sub>3</sub>)] in group A were 0(0, 1.8) times, while the times of expansion in group B, C and D were 5.5(4.3, 6.8), 4.0(4.0, 7.0) and 5.5(3.5, 10.8) times, respectively, with statistical significance (all P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in times of expansion among groups B, C and D (all P&gt;0.05). The stent placement time [M(Q<sub>1</sub>,Q<sub>3</sub>)] in group B [7.5(6.3, 8.8) days] was shorter than that in group A [64.5(41.5, 75.5) days] (P=0.006). There was no significant difference in stent placement time between group C [38.0(28.0, 50.0) days] and group D [31.5(27.3, 66.3) days] and group A (both P&gt;0.05). The stent placement time in group C was longer than that in group B (P&lt;0.05).There was no significant difference in stent placement time between group B, C and D (all P&gt;0.05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of complications among the groups (all P&gt;0.05). Conclusions: Autologous mucosal transplantation is safe and effective in preventing stenosis after near-circumferential ESD for early esophageal cancer. The effect of autologous mucosal transplantation combined with fully covered metal stent placement, systemic and local steroid application in preventing esophageal stricture after near-circumferential ESD for early esophageal cancer is better than that of single application.
