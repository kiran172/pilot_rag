Title: Pott's disease with extensive cold abscess in the abdominal cavity which was misinterpreted as malignancy.

Abstract: Pott's disease is a distinctive presentation of tuberculosis that occurs in approximately 5% of extrapulmonary cases that progressively developed a voluminous paravertebral abscess. While the disease is marked only by the occurrence of inflammatory symptoms and low-grade pain, the advanced mimics other infections and malignancies. Therefore, early recognition is important for proper treatment preventing deformity of the residual spinal and permanent neurological deficit. We present a 20-years-old woman who experienced low back pain for 2 years and presented with a right-side lump in the abdomen. CT and MRI were performed in this case. CT image showed bone destruction and extensive abscess formation, while on an MRI there was epidural granulation and compacted cauda equina resulting in severe central canal stenosis. To clarify the diagnosis, a chest radiograph and Mantoux test were performed and the patient was confirmed positive for lung tuberculosis. After antituberculosis drug treatment, (Isoniazid, Rifampicin, Pyrazinamide, and Ethambutol) initial phase, the patient had difficulty walking.
