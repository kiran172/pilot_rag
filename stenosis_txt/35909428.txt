Title: Lutembacher syndrome presenting as heart failure in a young Nigerian at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex (OAUTHC), Ile-Ife: a case report.

Abstract: Lutembacher syndrome (LS) is a rare syndrome comprising a combination of atrial septal defect (ASD) and mitral stenosis. We present the case of a 28-year-old man, who presented with progressively worsening dyspnea of 2 months associated with orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, bilateral leg swelling and productive cough. Chest X-ray revealed plethoric lung fields with prominent pulmonary conus and cardiomegaly. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed a large ostium secundum ASD with left to right shunt, mild mitral stenosis, severe mitral and tricuspid regurgitations and pulmonary hypertension. A diagnosis of Lutembacher syndrome in heart failure with pulmonary hypertension was made. The patient was managed conservatively, but declined surgery primarily because of financial reasons. This rare case of LS presenting with heart failure and complicated by pulmonary hypertension is the first reported case in our centre and our region. The patient's inability to afford the cost of definitive care posed a significant problem in his management.
