Title: Case report: Intensive statin and PCSK-9 inhibitor combo reduces plaque volume and stenosis in ischemic stroke patient.

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic ischemic stroke dramatically impacts the quality of life among the elderly. Statins therapy has been proven to be effective in plaque stabilization and alleviation in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic ischemic stroke. According to recent studies, these effects may be directly related to lipid levels rather than specific lipid-lowering drugs. Anti-proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (PCSK-9 inhibitor) are newer effective lipid-lowering drugs increasingly prescribed to patients at high cardiovascular risk to lower LDL cholesterol. Studies have provided evidence that PCSK9 inhibitor combined with statin therapy can lead to a decrease in the plaque volume measured by intravascular ultrasound in coronary heart disease patients. But the efficacy of combination of the two drugs in symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis has been unknown. Here we provide a case which was reported to suggest that a combination of Evolocumab and intensive statin therapy might reverse or alleviate symptomatic intracranial artery stenosis.
