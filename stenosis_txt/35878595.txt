Title: Changes in Pulmonary Function Test Results and Respiratory Symptoms before and after Airway Stent Removal.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway stenting is a useful form of palliation for patients with airway stenosis/fistulas; the stent can be removed after addressing the cause of the airway disorder. Patients with airway stents often complain of coughing and difficulty with expectoration, so the use of such stents can negatively affect pulmonary function and worsen symptoms.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms before and after stent removal.
METHODS: Patients who would later undergo simple airway stent removal were prospectively recruited in two institutions. All stents were removed using both rigid and flexible bronchoscopes with patients under general anesthesia. Pulmonary function tests were performed before stent removal and at 1 and 4 weeks after stent removal. All patients self-reported their respiratory symptoms using a 100-mm visual analog scale (VAS).
RESULTS: Of the 31 patients enrolled, 28 (23 with malignant stenoses, 3 with benign stenoses, and 2 with fistulas [21 silicone and 7 metallic stents]) were included in analyses. Pulmonary function measurements before stent removal and at 1 and 4 weeks after stent removal were as follows: vital capacity, 3.00, 3.04, and 3.08 L (p = 0.387); forced expiratory volume in 1 s, 1.96, 1.96, and 2.12 L (p = 0.034); and peak expiratory flow, 3.60, 4.28, and 5.06 L/s, respectively (p < 0.001). Symptoms (cough, sputum production, difficulty with expectoration, and dyspnea) evaluated using the VAS improved significantly after stent removal. No complications were encountered during removal.
CONCLUSION: Removal of unnecessary airway stents improves pulmonary function and respiratory symptoms. Any stent that is no longer functioning should be removed.
