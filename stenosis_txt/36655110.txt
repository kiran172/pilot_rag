Title: Stilbene-based derivatives as potential inhibitors of trimethylamine (TMA)-lyase affect gut microbiota in coronary heart disease.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is defined by atherosclerosis, which may result in stenosis or blockage of the arterial cavity, leading to ischemic cardiac diseases such as angina and myocardial infarction (MI). Accumulating evidence indicates that the gut microbiota play a critical role in the initiation and progression of CHD. The gut microbial metabolite trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) is intimately linked to the pathophysiology of CHD. The hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases (FMOs) convert trimethylamine (TMA) to TMAO. As a result, it is critical to prevent TMA generation. Stilbenes could reduce cardiovascular disease mortality. Twelve stilbenes with inhibitory activity against TMA-lyase were compiled and evaluated in this study. Docking results showed Resveratroloside had the highest Vina score, indicating that it was the most active and might be employed as a lead molecule for further structural modification.
