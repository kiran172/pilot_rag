Title: Evaluation of Plasma Asprosin Concentration in Patients with Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The goal of this study is to investigate the association between diagnosis and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) and Asprosin level.
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with CAD who underwent conventional coronary angiography for the first time were included in the present study. The patients were divided into four groups, each consisting of 20 individuals, as medical group, single coronary lesion group, double coronary lesion group, and multiple coronary lesions group. Serum Asprosin values and Gensini scores of the groups were compared in terms of compliance.
RESULTS: In this study, Asprosin values were found to be significantly higher in the multiple coronary lesions group than in the medical, single coronary, and double coronary lesion groups (P<0.05). In the double coronary lesion group, Asprosin values were significantly higher (P<0.05) than the in the medical and single coronary lesion groups. It was also found that Asprosin values did not differ at significant levels in the medical and single coronary lesion groups (P>0.05). It was determined that the increases in Asprosin values and Gensini scores were compatible with each other.
CONCLUSION: The present study showed that the increases in serum Asprosin levels, along with the increases in the number of coronary arteries with critical stenosis, might be a marker in diagnosing and determining the severity of CAD.
