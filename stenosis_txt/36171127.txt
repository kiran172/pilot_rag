Title: Emergency Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in a Surgical Aortic Bioprosthetic Valve for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Caused by Sudden Progression of Structural Valve Deterioration.

Abstract: Bioprosthetic aortic valves have limited durability. We herein report sudden progression of structural valve deterioration (SVD) and a successful case of emergency transcatheter aortic valve (TAV) implantation for acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) caused by SVD. A 79-year-old man who had undergone a Bentall operation 11 years prior was diagnosed with ADHF due to suddenly progressive SVD. Emergency TAV implantation in the surgical bioprosthetic valve was selected based on the surgical risk. Ours and previous case reports suggest that SVD can progress suddenly, even after months of stability, and that emergency TAV implantation is effective.
