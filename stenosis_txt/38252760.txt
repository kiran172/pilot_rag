Title: Randomized Secondary Prevention Trials in Participants With Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis.

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis is a prevalent cause of ischemic stroke worldwide. Its association with silent cerebral infarcts and its contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia emphasize the critical need for disease prevention and effective management strategies. Despite extensive research on secondary stroke prevention treatment over the past several decades, intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis continues to exhibit a notably higher recurrent stroke rate compared with other causes. This review focuses on randomized secondary prevention trials involving antithrombotic therapy, endovascular treatment, open surgical therapy, and remote ischemic conditioning. It aims to provide an insightful overview of the major findings from each trial and their implications for future research efforts.
