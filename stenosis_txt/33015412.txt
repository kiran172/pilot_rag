Title: Interaction of Autotaxin With Lipoprotein(a) in Patients With Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Our objectives were to determine whether autotaxin (ATX) is transported by lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] in human plasma and if could be used as a biomarker of calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). We first found that ATX activity was higher in Lp(a) compared to low-density lipoprotein fractions in isolated fractions of 10 healthy participants. We developed a specific assay to measure ATX-Lp(a) in 88 patients with CAVS and 144 controls without CAVS. In a multivariable model corrected for CAVS risk factors, ATX-Lp(a) was associated with CAVS (p = 0.003). We concluded that ATX is preferentially transported by Lp(a) and might represent a novel biomarker for CAVS.
