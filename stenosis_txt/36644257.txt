Title: Venous Stenting for Postthrombotic Iliocaval Venous Obstructive Disease: Clinical Efficacy and Mid-term Outcomes.

Abstract: Postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) can cause both venous outflow obstruction and deep venous reflux, and results in severe symptoms of chronic venous disease. Venous stenting in the chronic iliocaval venous obstruction has been shown to be a safe and efficacious procedure. The long-term studies have shown the high patency rate, the good symptom relief, and the low recurrence rate of healed venous ulcerations. Although venous stenting has become a widely accepted treatment option in PTS with chronic venous occlusion or severe stenosis, it is not yet covered by insurance in Japan, and is being performed at limited facilities using off-label arterial stents. In this study, we performed venous stenting in 30 patients with the moderate and severe PTS. All patients showed significant improvement in their venous scores postoperatively, the Villalta score changed from a median of 16 before treatment to a median of 7 after treatment. Likewise, the Venous Clinical Severity Score and the Venous Disability Score dropped from a median of 13, 2.4 before treatment to 6, 1.2 after treatment, respectively. The primary patency and the secondary patency at 40 months were 93% and 96%, respectively. We report the excellent results and discuss current issues and future perspective in Japan.
