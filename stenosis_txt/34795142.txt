Title: [Ross-Konnno Procedure for the Patient of Intractable Subaortic Stenosis after Operation of Double Outlet Right Ventricle with Coarctation of the Aorta and Subaortic Stenosis:Report of a Case].

Abstract: Recurrent left ventricular outflow obstruction (LVOTO) after intraventricular rerouting (IVR) with ventricular septal defect (VSD) enlargement and aortic arch repair for double-outlet right ventricle (DORV), non-committed VSD and coarctation of the aorta was successfully performed by a Ross-Konno procedure at 1 year 6 months as the second reoperation. Ross-Konno procedure could be an effective option in treatment of recurrent LVOTO after IVR for DORV.
