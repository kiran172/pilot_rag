Title: Whole blood viscosity in patients with aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Whole blood viscosity (WBV) may promote endothelial shear stress, inflammation, and can accelerate the atherosclerotic process. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between WBV and aortic stenosis. The study included 209 participants of whom 49 patients had severe aortic stenosis, 98 patients had mild-to-moderate aortic stenosis and 62 patients served as control. WBV values were significantly higher for high shear rate (HSR) (P = 0.001) and for low shear rate (LSR) (P = 0.002) in severe aortic stenosis group. HSR and LSR were correlated with mean systolic transaortic gradient (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively). WBV for both LSR and HSR were found to be independent predictors for the aortic stenosis severity (P = 0.034 and P = 0.049, respectively). We found a significant relationship between WBV and aortic stenosis.
