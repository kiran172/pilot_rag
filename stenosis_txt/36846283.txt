Title: The Role of Self-Expandable Metallic Stents in the Treatment of Malignant Strictures in all Segments of the Gastrointestinal Tract.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Management of malignant gastrointestinal (GI) obstruction presents a significant challenge. Most patients are in a profoundly decompensated state due to underlying malignancy and are not ideal candidates for invasive surgical procedures. Self-expandable metallic stents (SEMSs) are used to provide permanent or temporary patency in all endoscopically accessible stenosis of the GI tract. In this study, it is aimed to analyse the characteristics and the efficacy of patients with malignant stenosis treated with SEMS, in all segments of the GI tract.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 60 patients who underwent SEMS replacement, between 10 March 2014 and 16 December 2020, to treat malignant-related strictures in the GI tract at the Gastroenterology Department of the Health Sciences University Umraniye Training and Research Hospital. The data of the patients, hospital data processing database and electronic endoscopic database records were retrospectively scanned and recorded. The general characteristics of the patients and the treatment-related features were analysed.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients who were placed SEMS was 69.7 ± 13.7 years. Uncovered (15%, n: 9), fully covered (13.3%, n: 8), or partially covered (71.6%, n: 43) SEMS were successfully placed in all patients. Clinical success in patients with SEMS was 85.7% in the esophagus, 100% in the small intestine and 90.9% in the stomach and colon. About 11.4% migration, 14.2% pain, 11.4% overgrowth and 5.7% ingrowth were detected in patients who had SEMS placed in the oesophagus. Pain was detected in 9.1% and ingrowth in 18.2% of patients who had SEMS placed in the stomach. Pain was detected in 18.2% of the patients who had SEMS placed in the colon and migration was found in 9.1%.
CONCLUSION: SEMS implant is a minimally invasive effective method in the palliative treatment of malignant strictures of the GI tract.
