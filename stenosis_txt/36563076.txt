Title: [Triple stenosis of brachio-basilic arteriovenous fistula: percutaneous transluminal angioplasty utility, case report and literature review].

Abstract: The major haemodialysis arteriovenous fistula (AVF) complication is stenotic disease. It is represented by a reduction of the arterial or venous caliper forming the AVF. Most frequently it is located in the juxta- anastomotic region of the venous segment. There are a lot of mechanisms responsible for the stenosis formation; some are correlated by the shear stress in the wall of venous tract with a lot of biochemical mechanisms, others are associated with the repetition of venipuncture during haemodialisys treatment. It is recommended that each dialysis center activate an AVF monitoring program capable of identifying and treating stenosis. We describe a clinical case of a young woman with a multiple stenosis disease of a brachio-basilical transposed AVF.
