Title: Gastric Perforation Encountered during Duodenal Stent Insertion.

Abstract: Gastric outlet obstruction is a major symptom in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic intervention is often challenging in severe strictures because the guidewire cannot pass beyond the stricture. Sometimes, the air itself cannot pass beyond the stricture, which can result in a severely distended stomach. Such a stomach is vulnerable to excessive air insertion or mechanical stress during endoscopic procedures, and endoscopists may encounter a higher rate of complications. Gastric perforation is rare but could be fatal. However, endoscopic management can show a favorable result if the perforation is noticed early. The authors report a case of the perforation of a gastric tear during duodenal stent insertion in a patient with a gastric outlet obstruction.
