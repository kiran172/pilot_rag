Title: Imaging Modalities Employed in the TAVR Procedure With a Focus on CTA: What the Radiologist Needs to Know.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Aortic stenosis (AS) is one of the most common valvular heart disease. Symptomatic AS is associated with a high mortality rate which prompts fast intervention. The introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has drastically improved the outcome of high surgical risk for mortality patients with severe AS. However, this procedure requires the employment of multimodality imaging in the pre-procedural planning, intra-procedural optimization, and post-procedural follow-up stages. This also requires an accurate understanding of the indications, measurements, strength, and limitations of each imaging modality during the different TAVR stages.
CONCLUSION: In this review, we aim to outline to radiologists the evidence-based approach and indications of different imaging modalities through the pre, peri, and post TAVR stages.
