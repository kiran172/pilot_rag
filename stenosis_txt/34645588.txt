Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a patient with premature coronary artery disease and calcific aortic stenosis complicated by heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.

Abstract: We describe a case of a 59-year-old man with severe heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and elevated lipoprotein(a) presenting with severe aortic stenosis, treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). His history also includes premature coronary artery disease requiring coronary artery bypass surgery at age 48 and a stroke at age 55. His pre-treatment lipid values include an LDL-Cholesterol (LDL-C) of 458 mg/dL, total cholesterol of 588 mg/dL, and lipoprotein (a) level of 351 nmol/L. Since his FH diagnosis, he has received several lipid-lowering agents including statins, bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid derivatives, and PCSK9 inhibitors. This case reflects the association of FH and elevated lipoprotein(a) with aortic stenosis and TAVR as a viable and effective treatment.
