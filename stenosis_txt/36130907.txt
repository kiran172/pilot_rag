Title: Successful management of unstable angina in a ravulizumab-treated patient with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria.

Abstract: Ravulizumab is an anti-C5 antibody approved for treating paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). In August 2019, a 77-year-old Japanese man with PNH, who had been on ravulizumab treatment for 2 years, was hospitalized for chest discomfort and malaise. Electrocardiography identified a right bundle block, and elevated serum troponin I and d-dimer suggested ischemic heart disease. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery, and intracoronary stenting relieved his chest discomfort. The final diagnosis was unstable angina unrelated to ravulizumab, and the patient's ravulizumab treatment was uninterrupted with no significant complications of PNH. This case report highlights the importance of continuing complement inhibition therapy during acute coronary events.
