Title: Cholesteatoma: Canalplasty for External Auditory Stenosis in a Pediatric Patient.

Abstract: External auditory canal (EAC) stenosis is the narrowing of the external auditory meatus to less than 4 mm. Severe stenosis of the EACÂ may inhibit the ability to conduct sound and may lead to the formation of a cholesteatoma. While most cases of EAC stenosis may be managed nonoperatively, the significant impact that the associated symptoms can have on patients may require surgical intervention. Progression of the cholesteatoma can erode the bony ossicles, may encase the facial nerve, and impact infection risk causing chronic otorrhea, and further worsening patient quality of life. We present the case of a pediatric patient who presented due to chronic left-sided hearing loss. Further examination and imaging demonstrated near-total obstruction of the left EAC secondary to a soft tissue mass and evidence of bony hypertrophy. Following a canalplasty, the patient now has returned to baseline hearing and has no associated complications. Canalplasty remains a safe, effective surgical intervention for EAC stenosis complicated by cholesteatoma.
