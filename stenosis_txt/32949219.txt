Title: Balloon aortic valvuloplasty for urgent treatment of severe aortic stenosis during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: a case report.

Abstract: An 86-year-old man affected by severe aortic stenosis (AS) was referred to our institution owing to decompensated heart failure. Three months before, the patient was scheduled for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), which was postponed owing to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Owing to COVID-19 suspicion, he underwent nasopharyngeal swab and was temporarily isolated. However, the rapid deterioration of clinical and haemodynamic conditions prompted us to perform balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) as bridge to TAVI. The patient's haemodynamics improved; and the next day, the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for COVID-19 was negative. At Day 5, he underwent TAVI procedure. Subsequent clinical course was uneventful. During COVID-19 pandemic, the deferral of TAVI procedure should be assessed on a case-by-case basis to avoid delay in patients at high risk for adverse events. BAV may be an option when TAVI is temporarily contraindicated such as in AS patients suspected for COVID-19.
