Title: Intracoronary thrombolysis and stentless primary percutaneous coronary intervention in an ectatic right coronary artery with large thrombus burden.

Abstract: A 58-year-old man was admitted to our center with an inferior ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. A coronary angiogram showed an ectatic right coronary artery (RCA) occluded at mid vessel by a significant clot burden quantified by micro-computed tomography. Guide catheter-directed intracoronary thrombolysis with low-dose tenekteplase resulted in regaining RCA flow, when numerous efforts of manual and 'mother-child' thrombectomy had failed to achieve. A stentless strategy was followed with final thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 3 flow and angiographically insignificant stenosis remaining in the RCA. The combination of intracoronary thrombolysis and a stentless strategy is a safe and effective treatment in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction patients with ectatic arteries and large thrombus burden when repeat manual aspiration thrombectomy fails.
