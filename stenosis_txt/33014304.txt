Title: Intravascular Imaging in Acute Coronary Syndrome Patients without Significant Stenosis on Coronary Angiography.

Abstract: Intravascular coronary imaging has facilitated the field of interventional cardiology with multiple studies showing the superiority of intravascular image-guided percutaneous coronary interventions for the reduction of lesion revascularization rates. It also aids in understanding the mechanism of myocardial infarction with nonobstructive coronary artery disease. Despite such results, there is a slow adaptation of intravascular imaging use in the real world. We present two cases where intravascular imaging helped in the rapid understanding of the etiology of acute coronary syndrome and facilitated the management of both patients.
