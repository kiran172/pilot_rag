Title: Laparoscopic ventral onlay ureteroplasty with buccal mucosa graft for complex proximal ureteral stricture.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is lack of papers dedicated to the laparoscopic buccal mucosa graft (BMG) ureteroplasty of the complex upper ureteral stricture. The aim of this study is to evaluate the results of laparoscopic BMG ureteroplasty in patients with complex proximal ureteral stricture.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Twenty-four patients underwent laparoscopic ventral onlay BMG ureteroplasty for long or recurrent proximal ureteral stricture not amenable to uretero-ureteral anastomosis over 2019-2022. Patient demographics, operative time, estimated blood loss, length of stay, follow-up, intra- and postoperative complication rate and percentage of stricture-free at last visit were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean stricture length was 3.6 cm. The mean operative time was 208.3 min, while mean blood loss was 75.8 mL. The length of hospital stay was 7.3 days. No intraoperative complications were observed. Postoperatively, seven patients developed complications (29.2%). Five patients experienced a Grade II (according to Clavien nomenclature). Two patients developed a Grade IIIa complication, which included leakage of the anastomosis site. The mean follow-up was on the 22 months with stricture free rate 87.5%.
CONCLUSION: Patients with proximal ureteral strictures could be effectively treated by laparoscopic ventral onlay ureteroplasty with a buccal mucosa graft.
