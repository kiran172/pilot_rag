Title: aVR: The forgotten lead in acute coronary syndrome: A case series.

Abstract: Lead aVR is often considered as a neglected lead or forgotten lead owing to its reciprocal location to the lateral leads. However, it has diagnostic and prognostic importance in cases of acute coronary syndromes. We present a series of four cases of acute coronary syndrome with ST elevation (STE) in aVR and critical stenosis in coronary vessels. Patients with STE in aVR have a poor prognosis with increased morbidity not limited to increased chances of heart failure at presentation, greater hemodynamic instability, and in-hospital acute kidney injury, as well as increased mortality due to large infarction areas. Thus, early revascularization is warranted in such cases.
