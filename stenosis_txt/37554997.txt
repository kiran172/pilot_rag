Title: Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of palivizumab in off-label neonates, infants, and young children at risk for serious respiratory syncytial virus infection: a multicenter phase II clinical trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pediatric patients with certain rare diseases are at increased risk of severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. However, the prophylactic use of anti-RSV antibody (palivizumab) in these patients is not indicated at present in Japan.
METHODS: This first-in-the-world multicenter, uncontrolled, open-label, phase II clinical trial was carried out between 28 July 2019 and 24 September 2021 at seven medical institutions in Japan to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics of palivizumab in 23 subjects recruited from among neonates, infants, or children aged 24 months or younger who had any of the following conditions: pulmonary hypoplasia, airway stenosis, congenital esophageal atresia, inherited metabolic disease, or neuromuscular disease. At least four continuous doses of palivizumab were administered intramuscularly at 15 mg/kg at intervals of 30 days.
FINDINGS: Twenty-three enrolled subjects completed the study. No subject required hospitalization for RSV. Adverse events (AE) did not notably differ from the event terms described in the latest interview form. Five severe AEs required unplanned hospitalization, but resolved without RSV infection. Therapeutically effective concentrations of palivizumab were maintained throughout the study period.
INTERPRETATION: Palivizumab might be well tolerated and effective in preventing serious respiratory symptoms and hospitalization due to severe RSV infection, indicating the prophylactic use in the pediatric patients included in this study.
