Title: Life-Saving Multidisciplinary Management of Self-Inflicted Tracheal Transection: A Case Report.

Abstract: Self-inflicted cut-throat injuries, often associated with severe psychiatric disorders and exacerbated by socioeconomic factors, present significant medical complexities. Here, we present the case of a 45-year-old male with major depressive disorder who attempted suicide with a sword, resulting in complete tracheal transection. Upon admission, he presented with severe respiratory distress and hemorrhage, necessitating immediate fluid resuscitation and immediate airway securing with pediatric fiberoptic bronchoscopy, which successfully stabilized his airway. The surgical intervention included end-to-end tracheal anastomosis and T-tube placement without immediate complications. Postoperatively, the patient required intensive care with ventilator support and psychiatric intervention. Successful management of severe self-inflicted neck injuries relies on prompt airway control, precise surgical techniques, and comprehensive postoperative care to mitigate complications such as sepsis and tracheal stenosis.
