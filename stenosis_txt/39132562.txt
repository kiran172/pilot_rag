Title: Transmitral Gradient Assessment Using a Radial Coronary Catheter and Pressure Wire: The First Clinical Report.

Abstract: •Single radial artery access for direct transmitral gradient measurement is feasible•A radial TIG coronary catheter can be advanced retrograde into the left atrium•A coronary pressure wire is delivered to the left atrium and left in place•The catheter is subsequently withdrawn into the left ventricle•This permits simultaneous left atrial and left ventricular hemodynamic assessment.
