Title: Coronary sinus Reducer device for the treatment of refractory angina: A multicenter initial experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The coronary sinus Reducer (CSR) device has emerged as a complementary therapy in patients with severe angina refractory to optimal medical therapy and not amenable to revascularization. Our aim was to assess the safety and efficacy of the CSR in a real-world setting.
METHODS: Twenty-six patients with refractory angina (RA) and evidence of myocardial ischemia attributable to the left coronary artery considered unsuitable for revascularization were treated with the CSR at two centers between May 2017 and July 2019. Safety endpoints were procedural success and complications. Efficacy endpoints, assessed at six-month follow-up, were reduction in CCS class, improvement in quality of life (QoL) assessed using the short version of the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ-7), and reduction in antianginal therapy.
RESULTS: Twenty-three patients had end-stage coronary artery disease without revascularization targets and three had microvascular disease without epicardial stenosis. Procedural success was achieved in 23 patients, with two device/procedure-related complications and one anatomically-related failure to deliver the device. A total of 24 patients had the device implanted and entered the efficacy analysis. Eighteen patients (75.0%) had a reduction of at least one CCS class, 41.7% had a reduction of at least two classes, and 16.7% became asymptomatic, with a mean reduction in CCS class of 1.3±0.2 (p=0.001) at six-month follow-up. All SAQ-7 domains improved, notably physical limitation (p=0.001), angina frequency (p=0.005) and QoL (p=0.006). There was a mean reduction in anti-ischemic drugs from 3.4±1.1 to 2.9±1.2 (p=0.010).
CONCLUSION: In this real-world, multicenter experience, implantation of the CSR was associated with improvement in angina and QoL in patients with RA.
