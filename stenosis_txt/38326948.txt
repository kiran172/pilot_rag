Title: Cocaine-associated Eustachian tube stenosis causing chronic 'glue ear': a rare cocaine-induced destructive lesion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cocaine is one of the most used recreational drugs. Whilst medical uses exist, chronic recreational nasal use of cocaine is associated with progressive destruction of the osseocartilaginous structures of the nose, sinuses and palate - termed cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions.
CASE REPORT: A 43-year-old male with a history of chronic cocaine use, presented with conductive hearing loss and unilateral middle-ear effusion. Examination under anaesthesia revealed a completely stenosed left Eustachian tube orifice with intra-nasal adhesions. The adhesions were divided and the hearing loss was treated conservatively with hearing aids. Whilst intra-nasal cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions are a well-described condition, this is the first known report of Eustachian tube stenosis associated with cocaine use.
CONCLUSION: This unique report highlights the importance of thorough history-taking, rhinological and otological examination, and audiometric testing when assessing patients with a history of chronic cocaine use. This paper demonstrates the complexity of managing hearing loss in such cases, with multiple conservative and surgical options available.
