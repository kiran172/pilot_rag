Title: Functional CAD-RADS using FFR<sub>CT</sub> on therapeutic management and prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To propose a novel functional Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) category system integrated with coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) and to validate its effect on therapeutic decision and prognosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Firstly, we proposed a novel functional CAD-RADS and evaluated the performance of functional CAD-RADS for guiding treatment strategies with actual clinical treatment as a reference standard in a retrospective multicenter cohort with CCTA and invasive FFR performed in all patients (n = 466). Net reclassification improvement (NRI) of functional CAD-RADS over anatomical CAD-RADS was calculated. Secondly, the prognostic value of functional CAD-RADS in a prospective two-arm cohort (566 [FFR<sub>CT</sub> arm] vs. 567 [CCTA arm]) was calculated, after a 1-year follow-up, functional CAD-RADS in FFR<sub>CT</sub> arm (n = 513) and anatomical CAD-RADS in CCTA arm (n = 511) to determine patients at risk of adverse outcomes were compared with a Cox hazard proportional model.
RESULTS: Functional CAD-RADS demonstrated superior value over anatomical CAD-RADS (AUC: 0.828 vs. 0.681, p < 0.001) and comparable performance to FFR (AUC: 0.828 vs. 0.848, p = 0.253) in guiding therapeutic decisions. Functional CAD-RADS resulted in the revision of management plan as determined by anatomical CAD-RADS in 30.0% of patients (n = 140) (NRI = 0.369, p < 0.001). Functional CAD-RADS was an independent predictor for 1-year outcomes with indexes of concordance of 0.795 and the corresponding value was 0.751 in anatomical CAD-RADS.
CONCLUSION: The novel functional CAD-RADS gained incremental value in guiding therapeutic decision-making compared with anatomical CAD-RADS and comparable power in 1-year prognosis with anatomical CAD-RADS in a real-world scenario.
KEY POINTS: • The novel functional CAD-RADS category system with FFR<sub>CT</sub> integrated into the anatomical CAD-RADS categories was originally proposed. • The novel functional CAD-RADS category system was validated superior value over anatomical CAD-RADS (AUC: 0.828 vs. 0.681, p &lt; 0.001) in guiding therapeutic decisions and revised management plan in 30.0% of patients as determined by anatomical CAD-RADS (net reclassification improvement index = 0.369, p &lt; 0.001). • Functional CAD-RADS was an independent predictor with an index of concordance of 0.795 and 0.751 in anatomical CAD-RADS for 1-year prognosis of adverse outcomes.
