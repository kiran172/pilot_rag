Title: Percutaneous Pulmonary Valve Implantation Based on Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Bypass Surgery.

Abstract: Approximately 5% of percutaneous pulmonary valve implantations (PPVIs) are at risk for coronary compression. Therefore, PPVI is contraindicated if coronary anomalies and tested coronary flow impairment are observed. Simultaneous right ventricular outflow tract ballooning and coronary angiography are mandatory elucidating contraindications for PPVI. We present the case of a 22-year-old woman who had Rastelli repair with chronic right heart failure. Weighing the risk of several offered surgical options, she underwent successful PPVI after minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass procedure.
