Title: Sex-based disparities in ascending aortic aneurysm surgery outcomes: a comprehensive analysis of 1148 consecutive patients with propensity-score matching.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Women undergoing cardiac surgery have been historically recognized to carry higher periprocedural mortality risk. We aimed to investigate the influence of sex on clinical presentation, perioperative, and long-term outcomes in patients who undergo surgery for ascending aortic aneurysm.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of 1148 consecutive patients (380 [33.1%] female) who underwent thoracic aortic surgery under moderate hypothermic circulatory arrest for ascending aortic aneurysms between 2001 and 2021. Baseline and operative characteristics, in-hospital mortality, and survival were compared between male and female patients before and after propensity-score-matched (PSM) analysis.
RESULTS: Women were significantly older (median age: 69 [IQR: 63-75] vs. 67 [IQR: 58-73]; P < 0.001), while men had a higher prevalence of aortic valve stenosis, bicuspid valve and coronary artery disease at the time of surgery (P < 0.05). After PSM, EuroSCORE II (4.36 [2.68; 6.87] vs. 3.22 [1.85; 5.31]; p < 0.001), and indexed aortic diameter were significantly higher in female patients (2.94 [2.68; 3.30] vs. 2.58 [2.38; 2.81] cm/m2, p < 0.001). In the matched cohort, men were more likely to experience postoperative delirium (18.1% vs. 11.5%; P = 0.002), and postoperative neurological deficits (6.7% vs. 3.0%, P = 0.044),. Female patients were more likely to receive postoperative packed red blood cells (p = 0.036) and fresh frozen plasma (p = 0.049). In-hospital and 30-day mortality was similar between both groups. Long-term survival was comparable between both groups with 88% vs. 88% at 5 years, 76% vs. 71% at 10 years, and 59% vs. 47% at 15 years.
CONCLUSION: Female patients required more transfusions, while males had a higher incidence of postoperative delirium and neurological deficits. Differences in preoperative age and timing of surgery between the sexes could be attributed to variations in comorbidity profiles and the greater prevalence of concomitant surgery indications in males.
