Title: Traumatic penile partial amputation of unusual occurrence: A case report.

Abstract: We report the clinical case of a 9-year-old boy admitted for open trauma to the penis which occurred 3 hours before his admission by domestic accident. The child pounding vegetables, was awkwardly struck on the penis with a pestle. After conditioning, exploration in the operating room found partial amputation of the glans with complete rupture of the urethra. Washing with trimming and urethral anastomosis on a urinary catheter were performed. Healing was obtained without urethral stenosis. Injuries to the penis in children are not common and their management can be tricky.
