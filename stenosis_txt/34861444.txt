Title: Outcome of Initial 3 Years of Cranial Endoscopy at DG Khan Medical College and Teaching Hospital, Dera Ghazi Khan.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: With the evolution of surgical approaches, endoscopic skull base surgery has emerged as a suitable alternative to many other invasive methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and outcome of cranial endoscopy in treating various neurosurgical intracranial pathologies in terms of procedural success and complications.
METHODS: This observational, prospective case series was conducted at the Department of Neurosurgery of DG Khan Medical College from November 2017 to October 2020. The study enrolled 74 patients with indications for cranial neuroendoscopy. Clinical examination was performed, and a detailed history of the disease was obtained. Follow-up was conducted in the outpatient department. The collected data were analyzed using statistical analysis software.
RESULTS: Of 77 procedures performed, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, arachnoid cyst fenestration, septostomy, colloid cyst excision, endoscopic assisted ventricular catheter placement, and intraventricular tumor biopsy were performed in 53.3%, 18.2%, 10.4%, 7.8%, 6.5%, and 3.9% of patients. Aqueductal stenosis was identified as the most common cause of obstructive hydrocephalus. Seizures and cerebrospinal fluid leaks were the most commonly reported complications (12% and 8.1%, respectively). The observed mortality rate was 2.7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Neuroendoscopic surgery has become safe and effective, as surgeon experience and learning have lowered the risk of complications, and offers a low-cost alternative intervention.
