Title: Comparison of statins with steroids and botulinum toxin A in the prevention of benign strictures after esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Preventing benign strictures following esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) remains difficult, and finding a safe, effective, and simple management method is vital. We previously reported that rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence and severity of strictures in a rabbit model of esophageal stricture. Accordingly, in this study, we compared the effects of statins, steroids, and botulinum toxin A (BTX-A) on stricture prevention after ESD involving more than three-fourths of the luminal circumference.
METHODS: Of the 1019 ESD cases treated between January 2015 and December 2020, 246 met the inclusion criteria, with 21 cases excluded due to loss to follow-up, tumor recurrence, death, or need for additional surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. Of the 225 included cases, 145 received no intervention, while the remaining 80 were treated: 16 with oral steroids, 20 with topical triamcinolone acetonide (TA) injection, 21 with topical BTX-A injection, and 23 with statins.
RESULTS: The occurrence stricture rate in the statins group (17.4%, 4/23) was significantly lower than in the non-intervention (75.2%, 109/145, P = 0.000), oral steroids (56.3%, 9/16, P = 0.011) and TA injection (50%, 10/20, P = 0.023) groups, but comparable to in the BTX-A injection (38.1%, 8/21, P = 0.124) group. The dysphagia score was lower in the statin than non-intervention group (P = 0.000). Although there was no significant difference in the number of required dilations between groups, the maximum number of dilations in the statins group was only six.
CONCLUSIONS: Statins may be a potential treatment to prevent esophageal strictures after extensive ESD; however, clinical trials should be conducted to validate this.
