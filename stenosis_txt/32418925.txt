Title: A Surgical Case of Bronchial Artery Aneurysm Connecting to a Pulmonary Artery and Vein Complicated by Racemose Hemangioma.

Abstract: We report a surgical case of bronchial artery aneurysm (BAA) that directly connected to a pulmonary artery and a pulmonary vein through an abnormal vessel. It was complicated by racemose hemangioma. This is a rare vascular malformation. An 82-year-old female had a large BAA that was found incidentally. First, we consider treating the BAA with embolization by interventional radiology (IVR). However, because of strong meandering of the bronchial artery, we could not advance a microcatheter into the BAA. Therefore, a surgical operation was performed through a standard posterior lateral thoracotomy. The BAA was located between the upper and lower lobes and directly connected to the pulmonary artery. Some bronchial artery branches that provided inflow to the aneurysm were ligated, and the abnormal vessel that connected the BAA to the upper pulmonary vein was ligated easily. A fistula between the BAA and pulmonary artery was sutured by the cardiovascular surgeon using an artificial cardiopulmonary device, with permissive stenosis of A2b (ascending A2).
