Title: Atherosclerotic plaque characteristics on quantitative coronary computed tomography angiography associated with ischemia on positron emission tomography in diabetic patients.

Abstract: Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) may show diffuse coronary artery atherosclerosis on coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). The present study aimed at quantification of atherosclerotic plaque with CTA and its association with myocardial ischemia on positron emission tomography (PET) in DM patients. Of 922 symptomatic outpatients without previously known coronary artery disease who underwent CTA, 115 with DM (mean age 65 ± 8 years, 58% male) who had coronary atherosclerosis and underwent both quantified CTA (QCTA) and PET were included in the study. QCTA analysis was performed on a per-vessel basis and the most stenotic lesion of each vessel was considered. Myocardial ischemia on PET was based on absolute myocardial blood flow at stress ≤ 2.4 ml/g/min. Of the 345 vessels included in the analysis, 135 (39%) had flow-limiting stenosis and were characterized by having longer lesions, higher plaque volume, more extensive plaque burden and higher percentage of dense calcium (37 ± 22% vs 28 ± 22%, p = 0.001). On univariable analysis, QCTA parameters indicating the degree of stenosis, the plaque extent and composition were associated with presence of ischemia. The addition of the QCTA degree of stenosis parameters (x2 36.45 vs 88.18, p &lt; 0.001) and the QCTA plaque extent parameters (x2 88.18 vs 97.44, p = 0.01) to a baseline model increased the association with ischemia. In DM patients, QCTA variables of vessel stenosis, plaque extent and composition are associated with ischemia on PET and characterize the hemodynamic significant atherosclerotic lesion.
