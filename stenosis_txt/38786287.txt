Title: Histological Changes in the Popliteal Artery Wall in Patients with Critical Limb Ischemia.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: This prospective study aims to illustrate the histopathological arterial changes in the popliteal artery in peripheral arterial disease of the lower limbs.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: A total of 60 popliteal artery segments taken from patients who had undergone lower limb amputation were examined between April and June 2023. The degree of arterial stenosis, medial calcinosis, and the vasa vasorum changes in the arterial adventitia were quantified. The presence of risk factors for atherosclerosis was also observed.
RESULTS: Atherosclerotic plaque was found in all of the examined segments. Medial calcinosis was observed in 40 (66.6%) of the arterial segments. A positive association between the degree of arterial stenosis and the vasa vasorum changes in the arterial adventitia was also found (p = 0.025). The level of blood sugar and cholesterol were predictive factors for the severity of atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Atherosclerosis and medial calcinosis are significant in patients who underwent lower limb amputation. Medial calcinosis causes damage to the arterial wall and leads to a reduction in responsiveness to dilator stimuli.
