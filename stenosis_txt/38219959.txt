Title: Comparison of the safety and efficacy of Neuroform Atlas stent deployed via Gateway balloon catheter and microcatheter for the treatment of intracranial stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of the Atlas stent released by the Gateway catheter and microcatheter in the treatment of intracranial stenosis (IS).
METHODS: The primary efficacy and safety outcomes were the in-stent restenosis (ISR) rate and post-procedural stroke or death within one month.
RESULTS: Atlas stents were deployed using the Gateway catheter and microcatheter in 19 (57.6 %) and 14 (42.4 %) procedures, respectively. Follow-up imaging data were available for 26 patients; the incidence of ISR was 15.4 %, and the ISR rate was higher, though not significantly, in the microcatheter group than in the Gateway group (30.0% vs. 6.25 %, P = .39). Clinical follow-up data were available for 30 patients; the post-procedural stroke rate was 3.3 % within one month and 13.3 % from one month to one year. The post-procedural stroke rate within one month was higher, though not significantly, in the microcatheter group than in the Gateway group (7.7% vs. 0 %, P = .43). The Gateway group had a significantly lower rate of post-procedural stroke in the same territory than that of the microcatheter group (0% vs. 30.8 %, P = .026). A higher incidence of residual stenosis <30 % was found in the non-ISR group than in the ISR group (72.2% vs. 0 %, P = .014).
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that the Atlas stent is safe and effective for IS treatment. The use of the Gateway catheter to deliver the Atlas stent appears to be safer than using microcatheter. The incidence of ISR may be related to the degree of the residual stenosis.
