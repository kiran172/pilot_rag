Title: Lacrimal Drainage System Problems After Rhinoplasty.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To report case series of permanent nasolacrimal system problems following rhinoplasty METHODS: The documents of patients with epiphora and history of rhinoplastic surgery were reviewed. The data of patients with permanent epiphora (continued over 3 months or started after 3 months of post-rhinoplasty surgery) and lacrimal drainage system (LDS) problems were analyzed for demographics, the result of diagnostic probing and irrigation, findings of orbital and paranasal sinuses CT scan, abnormalities in nasal endoscopy, treatment, and follow-up data.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients with epiphora and history of rhinoplasty were referred to our clinic. Ten of them had permanent epiphora and LDS problems. In these patients, the mean time between rhinoplasty and initial symptoms of LDS problems was 10.3 ± 15.1 (range, 0-45 months) and the mean time between rhinoplasty and the LDS surgery was 22.2 ± 19.5 months (range 4-60 months). Diagnostic probing and irrigation test revealed canalicular stenosis in four (40%) patients, pus reflux in four (40%), clear reflux without passage in four (40%), and partial nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) in two (20%) of patients. DCR was performed in eight (80%) patients. Therapeutic probing and lacrimal intubation were performed in two (20%) patients.
CONCLUSION: A permanent injury of the LDS is one of the important complications of the rhinoplastic surgery that should be managed based on the onset and duration of the symptoms and the location of the injury.
