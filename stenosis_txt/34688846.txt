Title: Carotid arterial wall MRI of apolipoprotein e-deficient mouse at 7 T using DANTE-prepared variable-flip-angle rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To optimize a sequence combining the delay alternating with nutation for tailored excitation (DANTE) preparative module with the variable-flip-angle rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement (VF-RARE) sequence (DANTE-VF-RARE) and to investigate its feasibility for vessel wall imaging in Apolipoprotein E-Deficient (ApoE-/-) mouse at 7 Tesla (T).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Specific T1/T2 values were used for producing a sharper vessel wall in the variable-flip-angle optimization scheme. The DANTE RF pulse flip angle and pulse train length were optimized for maximizing the wall-lumen contrast. ApoE-/- (fed high fat diet for 20/40/ 60 weeks, n = 9/4/4) and wild-type mice (controls, n = 3) were imaged at 7 T using VF-RARE, DANTE-VF-RARE, time-of-flight (TOF) angiography, and multi-slice T1-weighted 2D RARE coupled with inflow outflow saturation bands (IOSB-RARE). Wall-lumen contrast-to-noise-ratio efficiency (CNR<sub>eff</sub>), lumen area (LA), and wall area (WA) were compared between DANTE-VF-RARE and 2D IOSB-RARE sequences. Additionally, linear regression analysis was conducted between MR measurements and histomorphometric planimetry results.
RESULTS: Residual blood signal was observed in the four out of eighteen carotids on VF-RARE images, whereas it was significantly suppressed on DANTE-VF-RARE images. Compared with IOSB-RARE, DANTE-VF-RARE offered significantly improved CNR<sub>eff</sub> (P &lt; 0.001). The LA and WA were both comparable (P = 0.085 and 0.112, respectively) and showed excellent agreement between DANTE-VF-RARE and IOSB-RARE (ICC = 0.96 and 0.95, respectively). The luminal stenosis identified by DANTE-VF-RARE was in consistent with the results of TOF. Strong correlations were found between MR measurements and histopathological analysis for both WA (DANTE-VF-RARE: r = 0.92, slope = 0.94, P &lt; 0.001; IOSB-RARE: r = 0.93, slope = 0.94, P &lt; 0.001) and LA (DANTE-VF-RARE: r = 0.82, slope = 0.54, P &lt; 0.001; IOSB-RARE: r = 0.78, slope = 0.50, P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: DANTE-VF-RARE achieves effective blood signal suppression and is a feasible approach for the 3D carotid arterial wall imaging of ApoE-/- mouse at 7 T.
