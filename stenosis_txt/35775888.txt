Title: Early- and mid-term outcomes following redo surgical aortic valve replacement in patients with previous transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to analyse the early- and mid-term outcomes after redo surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with previous transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: Retrospective single-centre analysis of early- and mid-term outcomes following redo SAVR in patients with previous TAVI between 2013 and 2020. Primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality and mid-term survival.
RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 5756 patients underwent TAVI. Among them, 28 (0.5%) patients required redo SAVR after TAVI. During periods 2013-2016 and 2017-2020, 4/2184 (0.2%) patients and 24/3572 (0.7%) patients required SAVR after TAVI, respectively. The median logistic EuroSCORE was significantly higher at the time of SAVR than at the time of the index TAVI (5.9% vs 11.6%; P < 0.001). The median elapsed time between TAVI and redo SAVR was 7 months (3.5-14 months). Infective endocarditis (IE) was the most frequent indication for surgery [19 (67.8%) patients]. A total of 11 (39.3%) patients underwent isolated SAVR and 17 (60.7%) SAVR + additional cardiac surgical procedures. The overall in-hospital mortality was 14.3% (4/28). In-hospital mortality was 15.8% (3/19) among IE patients and 11.1% (1/9) among non-IE patients (P = 0.7). Overall estimated survival was 66.5%, 59.9% and 48.0% at 12, 18 and 24 months, respectively. Patients with IE showed a trend towards a lower estimated mid-term survival compared to non-IE patients [41.6% (95% confidence interval: 22.0-78.0%) vs 58.3% (95% confidence interval: 30.0-100%) survival at 24 months (P = 0.3)].
CONCLUSIONS: SAVR can be successfully performed in patients with prior TAVI despite the increased surgical risk and technical difficulty. IE is associated with decreased mid-term survival.
