Title: Prediction of the trans-stenotic pressure gradient with arteriography-derived hemodynamic features in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract: The pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is attributed to segmental stenosis of the venous sinus. The current treatment paradigm requires a trans-stenotic pressure gradient of ≥8 mmHg or ≥6 mmHg threshold. This study aimed to develop a machine learning screening method to identify patients with IIH using hemodynamic features. A total of 204 venous manometry instances (n = 142, training and validation; n = 62, test) from 135 patients were included. Radiomic features extracted from five arteriography perfusion parameter maps were selected using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and then entered into support vector machine (SVM) classifiers. The Thr8-23-SVM classifier was created with 23 radiomic features to predict if the pressure gradient was ≥8 mmHg. On an independent test dataset, prediction sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.972, 0.846, 0.919, and 0.980, respectively (95% confidence interval: 0.980-1.000). For the 6 mmHg threshold, thr6-28-SVM incorporated 28 features, and its sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC were 0.923, 0.956, 0.935, and 0.969, respectively (95% confidence interval: 0.927-1.000). The trans-stenotic pressure gradient result was associated with perfusion pattern changes, and SVM classifiers trained with arteriography perfusion map-derived radiomic features could predict the 8 mmHg and 6 mmHg dichotomized trans-stenotic pressure gradients with favorable accuracy.
