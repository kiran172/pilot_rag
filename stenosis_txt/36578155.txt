Title: A rare cause of pulmonary hypertension: Idiopathic fibrosing mediastinitis obstructing right pulmonary artery and pulmonary veins.

Abstract: Fibrosing mediastinitis is caused by a proliferation of fibrous tissue in the mediastinum with encasement of mediastinal viscera and compression of mediastinal bronchovascular structures. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) may occur as a severe complication of the disease. Herein, we report a patient diagnosed with fibrosing mediastinitis and pulmonary hypertension, whose imaging tests showed obstruction of right pulmonary artery and veins.
