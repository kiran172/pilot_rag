Title: Modified Meso-Rex bypass with umbilical vein recanalization and intra-operative stenting.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the usefulness of a novel modified Meso-Rex bypass surgical technique with umbilical vein recanalization and intra-operative stenting to treat portal vein cavernous transformation.
METHODS: In total, 13 portal vein cavernous transformation patients underwent Meso-Rex bypass surgery, consisting of bypass grafts between the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) and the recess of Rex as well as through the ligamentum teres hepatis without stent implantation (Group A, n = 9) and umbilical vein recanalization with intra-operative stent implantation (Group B, n = 4).
RESULTS: In Group A, the bypass diameter was 0-6 mm (median 3 mm) and blood flow velocity 25-115 cm/s (median 72 cm/s) 1 month after Meso-Rex bypass surgery, with open bypass times of 0-67 months (median 6 months); 6 patients in this group developed postoperative Meso-Rex bypass occlusions. A patient in Group A treated with ligamentum teres hepatis recanalization needed a thrombectomy and stent implantation during a second surgery 2 days after the Meso-Rex bypass, because of bypass thrombosis and umbilical vein stenosis. In Group B, the average modified Meso-Rex bypass diameter was 5.5-6.5 mm (median 6 mm), and the bypass vessels remained open in all patients, with blood flow rates of 45-100 cm/s (median 76.5 cm/s) 1 month after the modified Meso-Rex bypass, up to the endpoint (15-33 months, median 24 months). The rate of bypass occlusions in Group A and Group B were 22.2% and 0%, 30.0% and 0%, and 55.6% and 0% at 1 month, 3 months, and 1 year, respectively, after bypass surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Our novel modified Meso-Rex bypass approach for portal vein cavernous transformation treatment was effective with excellent long-term bypass patency.
