Title: Pulmonary Arteriovenous Malformation and Its Vascular Mimickers.

Abstract: Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a congenital vascular disease in which interventional radiologists can play both diagnostic and therapeutic roles in patient management. The diagnosis of pulmonary AVM is simple and can usually be made based on CT images. Endovascular treatment, that is, selective embolization of the pulmonary artery feeding the nidus of the pulmonary AVM, and/or selectively either the nidus or draining vein, has become a first-line treatment with advances in interventional devices. However, some vascular diseases can simulate pulmonary AVMs on CT and pulmonary angiography. This subset can confuse interventional radiologists and referring physicians. Vascular mimickers of pulmonary AVM have not been widely known and described in detail in the literature, although some of these require surgical correction, while others require regular follow-up. This article reviews the clinical and radiologic features of pulmonary AVMs and their mimickers.
