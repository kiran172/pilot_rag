Title: The prediction of acute ischemic stroke patients' long-term functional outcomes treated with bridging therapy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravenous thrombolysis therapy (IVT) bridged with intra-arterial thrombectomy (IAT) has recently been recommended as favorable treatment option to ensure that the thrombolytic effect is delivered to the affected region for acute ischemic stroke patients. However, there remains a lack of studies reporting outcome prediction in this group of patients. In this study, we aimed to identify indicators from baseline data that could be used for early prediction of long-term functional outcomes.
METHODS: This retrospective single center cohort study included acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients (n = 92) who received IVT and IAT. Functional outcomes were assessed by the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Barthel Index. We investigated the relationship between functional outcomes at one-year post-procedure and potential predictors such as occlusion site, modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score following the IVT/IAT procedure, and degree of stenosis measured by carotid duplex.
RESULTS: 67.4% of the studied patients had satisfactory outcomes with mTICI grades of 2b or 3. From baseline to one-year post-procedure, the NIHSS score improved in 88.0%, the mRS score improved in 69.6%, and the Barthel index improved with 59.8%. Patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) or vertebral artery (VA) stenosis detected by carotid duplex had significantly poorer functional outcomes, measured by the mRS score and Barthel index. In patients with a satisfactory mTICI grade, improvement in the mRS score was only observed in 60.0% of patients with ICA stenosis, compared to 93.8% without ICA stenosis. The VA stenosis was the most significant factor associated with the improvement of mRS (OR = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.01-0.63; P = 0.017) and Barthel Index (OR = 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01-0.47; P = 0.008) in multiple regression analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: ICA or VA stenosis detected by carotid duplex could serve as predictors of significantly poorer functional outcomes in stroke patients treated with bridging therapy; they might be useful clinical markers, particularly as stenosis could be detected by a non-invasive and portable method.
