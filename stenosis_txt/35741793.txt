Title: Pathogenesis of Choledochal Cyst: Insights from Genomics and Transcriptomics.

Abstract: Choledochal cysts (CC) is characterized by extra- and/or intra-hepatic b\ile duct dilations. There are two main theories, "pancreaticobiliary maljunction" and "congenital stenosis of bile ducts" proposed for the pathogenesis of CC. Although family cases or CC associated with other anomalies have been reported, the molecular pathogenesis of CC is still poorly understood. Recent advances in transcriptomics and genomics analysis platforms have unveiled key expression signatures/genes/signaling pathways in the pathogenesis of human diseases including CC. This review summarizes insights from genomics and transcriptomics studies into the pathogenesis of CC, with the aim to improve (i) our understanding of its underlying complex pathomechanisms, and (ii) clinical management of different subtypes of CC, in particular their associated hepatic fibrotic change and their risk of malignancy transformation.
