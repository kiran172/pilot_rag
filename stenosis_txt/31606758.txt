Title: Relationship between 'on-treatment platelet reactivity', shear stress, and micro-embolic signals in asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Assessment of 'high on-treatment platelet reactivity (HTPR)' could enhance understanding of the pathophysiology of first or recurrent vascular events in carotid stenosis patients on antiplatelet therapy.
METHODS: This prospective, multi-centre study assessed antiplatelet-HTPR status and its relationship with micro-emboli signals (MES) in asymptomatic vs. symptomatic ≥ 50-99% carotid stenosis. Platelet function/reactivity was assessed under 'moderately high shear stress' with the PFA-100® and 'low shear stress' with VerifyNow® and Multiplate® analysers. Bilateral 1-h transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral arteries classified patients as MES + ve or MES - ve.
RESULTS: Data from 34 asymptomatic patients were compared with 43 symptomatic patients in the 'early phase' (≤ 4 weeks) and 37 patients in the 'late phase' (≥ 3 months) after TIA/ischaemic stroke. Median daily aspirin doses were higher in early symptomatic (225 mg; P &lt; 0.001), but not late symptomatic (75 mg; P = 0.62) vs. asymptomatic patients (75 mg). There was a lower prevalence of aspirin-HTPR in early (28.6%; P = 0.028), but not late symptomatic (38.9%; P = 0.22) compared with asymptomatic patients (56.7%) on the PFA-100®, but not on the VerifyNow® or Multiplate® (P ≤ 0.53). Early symptomatic patients had a higher prevalence of aspirin-HTPR on the PFA-100® (28.6%) vs. VerifyNow® (9.5%; P = 0.049), but not Multiplate® assays (11.9%, P = 0.10). There was no difference in aspirin-HTPR prevalence between any symptomatic vs. asymptomatic MES + ve or MES - ve subgroup.
DISCUSSION: Recently symptomatic moderate-severe carotid stenosis patients had a lower prevalence of aspirin-HTPR than their asymptomatic counterparts on the PFA-100®, likely related to higher aspirin doses. The prevalence of antiplatelet-HTPR was positively influenced by higher shear stress levels, but not MES status.
