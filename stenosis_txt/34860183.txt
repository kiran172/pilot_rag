Title: Hydrodynamic Approach for Revealing Venous Anastomotic Stenosis Formation Within a Dialysis Arteriovenous Graft.

Abstract: A conventional arteriovenous graft in patients on dialysis often leads to anastomotic stenosis, which decreases the blood flow rate and increases the risk of complications. In this study, based on hydrodynamics, the pulsatile pressure at the blood vessel graft-vein junction was investigated experimentally and numerically for revealing the causes of stenosis formation and inward remodeling. In the experiments, the pulsatile pressure and displacement at the anastomotic connection were measured at a branched collapsible tube. It was revealed that the pressure becomes negative between pressure peaks of the pulsatile flow; furthermore, tube diameter changes in accordance with the pressure pulsation. Subsequently, numerical simulations revealed that a relatively large pressure difference occurs at the anastomotic connection because of flow collision and separation as compared with the other part, and the pulsatile pressure. Therefore, it is possible that vein at an anastomotic connection may change its shape under pulsating flow. Furthermore, it was found that the pressure difference slightly increased with the anastomosis angle, but the anastomosis angle did not affect the flow rate. Clinical trials in the next step are required to reveal the causal relationship between stenosis and the pulsatile pressure, but the pulsatile flow and its pressure are likely to be one factor in stenosis and inward remodeling.
