Title: Correlation between SHP-1 and carotid plaque vulnerability in humans.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Advanced atherosclerotic plaques tend to indicate an increased risk of cerebral ischemic events. SH2 domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) is a class I classical nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase associated with plaque stability, as shown by analysis of a Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset showing differences in mRNA levels. However, the correlation between SHP-1 and human carotid plaque stability at the protein level remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-nine carotid plaque tissue samples were acquired from 39 carotid artery stenosis patients after carotid endarterectomy. Hematoxylin and eosin, Masson trichrome, and CD68 staining was performed for pathological characterization, and immunohistochemical staining for SHP-1 was carried out. Within stable and unstable plaques, SHP-1 mainly accumulated in the necrotic area, plaque shoulder, and fibrous cap, similar to the distribution of CD68. A quantitative analysis of SHP-1 was carried out. The relative SHP-1-positive cell area was higher in the vulnerable group than in the stable group (P < .001). The number of symptomatic patients in the vulnerable group was no greater than that in the stable group (P = .098). Moreover, the integrated optical density (IOD)/area of SHP-1 was significantly higher in the vulnerable group than in the stable group (P < .001). Besides, SHP-1 colocalized with CD68 and vascular cell adhesion protein 1(VCAM-1).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that SHP-1 expression increases during carotid atherosclerotic plaque progression. The protein expression of SHP-1 was related to an increase in plaque instability in not only symptomatic but also asymptomatic patients with carotid artery stenosis. SHP-1 may play a role in atherosclerosis progression by macrophage polarization-mediated efferocytosis. Furthermore, SHP-1 may become a promising biomarker for plaque vulnerability in the future.
