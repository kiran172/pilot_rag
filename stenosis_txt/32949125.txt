Title: Surgical treatment for a pulmonary artery aneurysm with stenosis of the quadricuspid pulmonary valve.

Abstract: We report a case of pulmonary artery aneurysm and pulmonary stenosis with a quadricuspid pulmonary valve in a 64-year-old woman. While pulmonary artery disease had been found as a child, she needed no treatment because of the absence of symptoms and her normal physical development. She began experiencing dyspnoea on exertion 3 years ago. Echocardiography showed pulmonary artery aneurysm and severe pulmonary stenosis with a quadricuspid valve. Computed tomography showed a pulmonary artery aneurysm extending from its main trunk to the bilateral branches. The pulmonary valve was replaced, and the pulmonary trunk and its bilateral branch were reconstructed. The patient's postoperative course was uneventful.
