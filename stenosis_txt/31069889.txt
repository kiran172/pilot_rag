Title: Combination of Plaque Characteristics, Pial Collaterals, and Hypertension Contributes to Misery Perfusion in Patients With Symptomatic Middle Cerebral Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic plaque in the middle cerebral artery (MCA) is linked to ischemic stroke events, but the relationship between plaque characteristics and cerebral perfusion is unclear.
PURPOSE: To investigate MCA plaque characteristics between intracranial atherosclerotic patients with and without hypoperfusion area, and to identify the variables affecting hypoperfusion volume.
STUDY TYPE: Retrospective.
POPULATION: Seventy-one patients with MCA stenosis (>50%), and all with ischemic onset in recent 2 weeks.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3.0T MRI / diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography (TOF-MRA), inversion-recovery prepared sampling perfection with application-optimized contrast using different flip angle evolutions (IR-SPACE), dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion-weighted imaging (DSC-PWI).
ASSESSMENT: Plaque characteristics including eccentric index (EI), eccentricity, plaque length, and enhancement on MCA were measured on IR-SPACE. Pial collaterals (PCs) were evaluated on axial TOF-MRA source images. Time-to-maximum (Tmax) maps with a threshold more than 6 seconds were assessed by rapid processing of perfusion and diffusion (RAPID) software.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Two independent-samples t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test, Z test, univariate and multivariate logistic analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used.
RESULTS: Patients with hypoperfusion had fewer eccentric plaque, lower EI, longer plaque length, and poor PCs compared with those without (P = 0.002, 0.016, 0.003, and 0.001). Eccentricity, plaque length, PCs, and hypertension were the factors independently associated with the occurrence of hypoperfusion after adjustment for risk factors of cerebrovascular disease (P = 0.014, 0.017, 0.035, and 0.018). The area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidence interval) was 0.865 (0.763-0.934) for a combination of the above four variables, which was significantly higher than any variable alone (P < 0.001, 0.016, < 0.001, and < 0.001). Patients with lower EI, concentric morphology, and grade 2 enhancement trended to have larger hypoperfusion volume (P = 0.028, 0.037, and 0.009).
DATA CONCLUSION: Plaque eccentricity, plaque length, PCs, and hypertension showed an association with the occurrence of hypoperfusion.
