Title: The clinical role of serum cell division control 42 in coronary heart disease.

Abstract: Cell division control 42 (CDC42) regulates blood lipids, atherosclerosis, T cell differentiation and inflammation, which is involved in the process of coronary heart disease (CHD). This study aimed to evaluate the CDC42 level and its correlation with clinical features, the T-helper 17 (Th17)/regulatory-T (Treg) cell ratio and prognosis in CHD patients. In total, 210 CHD patients, 20 healthy controls and 20 disease controls were enrolled. Serum CDC42 levels of all participants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In CHD patients, Th17 and Treg cells were discovered by flow cytometry; CHD patients were followed-up for a median of 16.9 months (range of 2.5-38.2 months). CDC42 level was lowest in CHD patients (median (interquartile range (IQR)): 402.5 (287.3-599.0) pg/mL), moderate in disease controls (median (IQR): 543.5 (413.0-676.3) pg/mL) and highest in healthy controls (median (IQR): 668.0 (506.5-841.3) pg/mL) (p &lt; .001). Moreover, in CHD patients, lower CDC42 level was related to more prevalent diabetes mellitus (p = .021), and higher levels of C-reactive protein (p = .001), Gensini score (p = .006), Th17 cells (p = .001) and Th17/Treg ratio (p &lt; .001) but was associated with lower Treg cells (p = .018). Furthermore, CDC42 low level [below the median level (402.5 pg/mL) of CDC42 in CHD patients] was correlated with higher accumulating major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) risk (p = .029), while no correlation was found between the quartile of CDC42 level and accumulating MACE risk in CHD patients (p = .102). The serum CDC42 level is decreased and its low level is related to higher Th17/Treg ratio and increased accumulating MACE risk in CHD patients.
