Title: The efficacy of newly proposed gastric open peroral endoscopic myotomy (GO-POEM) in preventing post-endoscopic submucosal dissection stenosis: A comparison with non-GO-POEM group.

Abstract: Extensive endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for gastric adenoma or early cancer can lead to post-ESD stenosis. This may cause a decrease in quality of life and an increase in medical issues. Therefore, this study examined the safety and effectiveness of gastric open peroral endoscopic myotomy (GO-POEM) in preventing stenosis following ESD. A retrospective investigation was carried out on 31 patients who underwent gastric ESD for > 75% of the lumen in the antrum or pylorus at the Presbyterian Medical Center in Korea between December 2004 and October 2022. The patients were divided into GO-POEM (n = 11) and non-GO-POEM groups (n = 20). The average age of the 31 patients was 73.23 years, and 18 were male. There were no differences in age, sex, location, gross findings, or procedure time between the 2 groups. In the GO-POEM group, only 1 patient (9 %) developed stenosis, compared to 11 patients (55 %) in the control group (P = .02). Multivariate analysis showed that the GO-POEM group had a significantly lower risk of post-ESD stenosis (P < .05). Stenosis symptoms resolved with a single endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) in 1 patient in the GO-POEM group. In contrast, 5 of 11 patients with stenosis in the non-GO-POEM group required a median of 2 EBD sessions (range, 1-8). GO-POEM may be an effective and reliable method for preventing stenosis post extensive gastric ESD. Further investigations are necessary to establish its efficacy and safety.
