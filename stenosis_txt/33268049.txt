Title: Please be upstanding - A narrative review of evidence comparing upright to supine lumbar spine MRI.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The objective of the review was to examine the evidence comparing upright to supine MRI of the lumbar spine.
KEY FINDINGS: A literature search identified 14 articles comparing data where subjects had been scanned in both supine and upright positions on the same scanner. Lumbar spine anatomy is dynamic and therefore subject to morphological changes when transitioning from the supine to the upright position. There is strong evidence to suggest structural changes in spinal morphology due to radiographic positioning, and that upright positioning is better for evaluating spondylolisthesis.
CONCLUSION: It has been demonstrated that the scanning position is important in the outcome of the MRI examination of the lumbar spine. With this in mind, it would be beneficial for guidance to be written and adopted to improve the consistency and quality of scanning.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: As upright MRI occupies a niche in the scanning sector, many professionals are unaware of its capabilities. This article aims to increase awareness of the use of upright MRI in evaluating the lumbar spine.
