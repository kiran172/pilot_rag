Title: Safety and efficacy of early carotid artery stenting in patients with symptomatic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Symptomatic carotid artery stenosis is a significant contributor to ischemic strokes. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is usually indicated for secondary stroke prevention. This study evaluates the safety and efficacy of CAS performed within a short time frame from symptom onset.
METHODS: We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of consecutive patients who underwent CAS for symptomatic carotid stenosis within eight days of symptom onset from July 2019 to January 2022. Data on demographics, medical history, procedural details, and follow-up outcomes were analyzed. The primary outcome measure was the recurrence of the stroke within the first month post-procedure. Secondary outcomes included mortality, the rate of intra-procedural complications, and hyperperfusion syndrome.
RESULTS: We included 93 patients with a mean age of 71.7 ± 11.7 years. The median time from symptom onset to CAS was 96 h. The rate of stroke recurrence was 5.4% in the first month, with a significant association between the number of stents used and increased recurrence risk. Mortality within the first month was 3.2%, with an overall mortality rate of 11.8% after a median follow-up of 19 months. Intra-procedural complications were present in five (5.4%) cases and were related to the number of stents used (p = 0.002) and post-procedural angioplasty (p = 0.045). Hyperperfusion syndrome occurred in 3.2% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Early CAS within the high-risk window post-symptom onset is a viable secondary stroke prevention strategy in patients with symptomatic carotid artery stenosis. The procedure rate of complication is acceptable, with a low recurrence of stroke. However, further careful selection of patients for this procedural strategy is crucial to optimize outcomes.
