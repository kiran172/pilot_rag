Title: Venous retrograde approach for endovascular angioplasty in chronic total pulmonary vein occlusion -a case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Fibrosing mediastinitis (FM) is a rare disease characterized by excessive proliferation of fibrous tissue in the mediastinum and can cause bronchial stenosis, superior vena cava obstruction, pulmonary artery and vein stenosis, etc. CASE PRESENTATION: An aging patient with intermittent chest tightness and shortness of breath was diagnosed with FM associated pulmonary hypertension (FM-PH) by echocardiography and enhanced CT of the chest, and CT pulmonary artery (PA)/ pulmonary vein (PV) imaging revealed PA and PV stenosis. Selective angiography revealed complete occlusion of the right upper PV, and we performed endovascular intervention of the total occluded PV. After failure of the antegrade approach, the angiogram revealed well-developed collaterals of the occluded RSPV-V2b, so we chose to proceed via the retrograde approach. We successfully opened the occluded right upper PV and implanted a stent.
CONCLUSIONS: This report may provide new management ideas for the interventional treatment of PV occlusion.
