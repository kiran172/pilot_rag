Title: Impact of Gastrojejunostomy Anastomosis Diameter on Weight Loss Following Laparoscopic Gastric Bypass: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) is crucial for significant weight reduction and treating obesity-related issues. However, the impact of gastrojejunostomy (GJ) anastomosis diameter on weight loss remains unclear. We investigate this influence on post-RYGB weight loss outcomes. A systematic search was conducted. Six studies met the inclusion criteria, showing varied GJ diameters and follow-up durations (1-5Â years). Smaller GJ diameters generally correlated with greater short-to-medium-term weight loss, with a threshold beyond which complications like stenosis increased. Studies had moderate-to-low bias risk, emphasizing the need for precise GJ area quantification post-operation. This review highlights a negative association between smaller GJ diameters and post-RYGB weight loss, advocating for standardized measurement techniques. Future research should explore intra-operative and AI-driven methods for optimizing GJ diameter determination.
