Title: Perioperative Outcomes of Carotid Interventions in Octogenarians.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In octogenarians with carotid stenosis, data supporting the decision to intervene and choice of intervention with either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or carotid artery stenting (CAS) have been conflicting. The purpose of this study was to compare the perioperative outcomes of CEA and CAS in octogenarians, and to identify patients at high risk for unfavorable outcomes.
METHODS: The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database (2011-2018) was queried for patients aged ≥80 years who underwent CAS or CEA. Propensity scores were created for the odds of undergoing CAS. Patients were matched 1:1 based on propensity score and outcomes were compared after matching. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for unfavorable postoperative outcomes.
RESULTS: In total, 15,858 and 527 patients who underwent CEA and CAS were identified. After matching, there was no difference between CEA and CAS in perioperative stroke (2.3% vs. 2.9%; P = 0.56), cardiac complications (2.3% vs. 2.3%; P = 0.99), mortality (1.1% vs. 1.7%; P = 0.44), length of stay (median [interquartile range], 2 [1-4] vs. 1 [1-4] days; P = 0.13), and 30-day readmission (11.8% vs. 11.6%; P = 0.92). On multivariable analysis, the following were predictive for postoperative stroke: urgent operation (odds ratio [OR], 2.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.68-2.69; P < 0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD; OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.09; P = 0.009), and American Society of Anesthesiologists class > III (OR, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.15-1.86; P = 0.002). Urgent procedure (OR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.11-3.87; P < 0.001), COPD (OR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.61-3.32; P < 0.001), dependent functional status (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.35-3.1; P < 0.001), and age ≥ 85 years (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.43-2.57; P < 0.001) were predictive for 30-day mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of CEA and CAS were similar in octogenarians. Risk factors for worse intervention outcomes were identified, which may guide risk-benefit discussions and shared decision-making.
