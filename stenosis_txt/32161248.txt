Title: [A case of mass-forming chronic pancreatitis with amputation neuroma-like neurogenesis of the bile duct].

Abstract: A man in his 40s visited a facility with the chief complaint of abdominal pain;liver dysfunction was detected, and consequently, he was referred to our hospital for further examinations. His medical history was unremarkable. He used to drink alcohol (beer, 1500mL) every day. Magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography showed stenosis of the distal bile duct and slight dilation of the upstream bile duct. Common bile duct stones and gallbladder stones were not detected. Malignant tumors in the bile duct biopsy were not discovered. The patient underwent subtotal stomach preserving pancreatoduodenectomy. The pathological diagnosis was chronic pancreatitis with amputation neuroma-like neurogenesis of the bile duct.
