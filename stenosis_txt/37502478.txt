Title: Generalized arterial calcification of infancy in a neonate with acute kidney injury: A rare case report.

Abstract: Generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI) is a rare condition characterized by diffuse arterial calcification within the internal elastic lamina associated with intimal proliferation leading to stenosis of great and medium-sized vessels, which causes end-organ damage and loss of life during infancy. The clinical presentation of acute renal failure with normal cardiac function is rare. A 7-day-old female neonate was admitted with a clinical impression of late-onset neonatal sepsis, meningitis, and acute kidney injury after developing a high-grade fever, abnormal body movements, and vomiting of the ingested matter associated with decreased urinary output. On laboratory tests, she had abnormal urea and creatinine levels, multiple electrolyte abnormalities, and a negative septic workup. Ultrasonography revealed diffuse arterial calcification that also involved the renal arteries and renal parenchyma bilaterally. She was clinically diagnosed with GACI and initiated on supportive care including renal replacement therapy. However, she died at the age of 42 days. This case highlights that GACI can present as unexplained acute kidney injury associated with generalized arterial calcification. Ultrasound can be optimized to aid in diagnosis in resource-limited settings.
