Title: Use of Transcarotid Artery Revascularization to Treat Symptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis Associated with Free-Floating Thrombus.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Free-floating thrombus in the internal carotid artery (ICA) has traditionally been treated via an open surgical approach through a longitudinal incision and exposure similar to that for carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In this case report, we present a novel use of transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) for the treatment of recurrent carotid stenosis associated with free-floating ICA thrombus.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We describe a 67-year-old female who presented with a diagnosis of right hemispheric stroke in evolution and prior history of right CEA and a mechanical mitral valve. Imaging confirmed high-grade recurrent stenosis of the right ICA with free-floating thrombus. TCAR was utilized to repair both the recurrent stenosis and the thrombus.
CONCLUSIONS: Redo CEA in the face of recurrent stenosis is a challenging clinical scenario, which in this instance, was further complicated by the presence of free-floating thrombus and active anticoagulation due to a mechanical mitral valve. This case report describes the successful management of ICA thrombus and restenosis with the novel use of TCAR.
