Title: Oral mucosal graft ureteroplasty versus ileal ureteric replacement: a meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes of oral mucosal graft ureteroplasty (OMGU) and ileal ureter replacement (IUR) and determine the relative merits of both procedures.
METHODS: Databases (including PubMed, Embase and Cochrane) were interrogated for eligible trials that assessed outcomes of OMGU or IUR from 2000 to 30 July 2022. The variables analysed were reconstruction success rates, stricture length, hospital stays, perioperative complications and long-term complications.
RESULTS: A total of 23 single-arm studies were included. The pooled reconstruction success rates for OMGU and IUR were 94.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.0%-97.7%) and 85.8% (95% CI 81.0%-90.0%), respectively. Stricture length of patients in the OMGU and IUR groups were 3.73 (95% CI 3.17-4.28) and 11.55 (95% CI 9.82-13.29) cm, respectively. The maximal stricture length repaired by OMGU was 8 cm. The hospital stays were 5.85 (95% CI 3.88-7.82) and 11.55 (95% CI 6.93-16.17) days in the OMGU and IUR groups, respectively. The incidences of low-grade postoperative complications were 13.6% (95% CI 6.9%-20.3%) and 27.3% (95% CI 19.5%-35.1%), high-grade postoperative complications were 4.6% (95% CI 1.8I-8.5%) and 13.0% (95% CI 9.4%-17.1%), and long-term complications (occurred at > 3months) were 9.0% (95% CI 1.7%-20.0%) and 35.4% (95% CI 25.8%-45.6%) in the OMGU and IUR groups, respectively.
CONCLUSION: An OMGU is an effective, minimally invasive, and safe alternative to IUR for the management of long ureteric strictures. OMGU was the preferred treatment for long ureteric strictures, especially obstructed ureter segments of ≤8 cm.
