Title: Risk of Stroke With Mitral Stenosis: The Underlying Mechanism, Treatment, and Prevention.

Abstract: Mitral stenosis (MS), a valvular heart disease, is defined by the narrowing of the mitral valve orifice. The common risk factors for stroke include mitral annular calcification (MAC), diabetes mellitus (DM), male gender, hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Endothelial damage, hypercoagulability, and blood stasis in the left atrium promote the development of the thrombus. Among all the risk factors described, MAC is the independent predictor of stroke. The complicated mechanisms responsible for thromboembolism, predisposing factors for thromboembolism, the risk of cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in MS patients, advanced standardized assessment models for identifying those at risk for stroke, and the possible advantages and disadvantages of available therapies have all been discussed in this review article. We have also discussed newer oral anticoagulants (NOACs) like dabigatran, edoxaban, apixaban, and rivaroxaban. Non-pharmacological therapies are also highlightedÂ such as left atrial appendage ligation and occlusion devices. We also conducted a thorough review of the literature on the efficacy and safety of various NOACs in reducing the risk of stroke.
