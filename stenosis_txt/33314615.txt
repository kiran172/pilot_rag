Title: Time is of the essence: A single-center experience of hepatic arterial supply impairment management in pediatric liver transplant recipients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Impairment of hepatic arterial flow including hepatic arterial thrombosis (HAT), hepatic arterial stenosis (HAS), and splenic artery steal syndrome (SASS) is potentially life-threatening complications. The proposed early diagnosis and urgent treatment strategy of graft arterial flow reduction aim to decrease morbidity and mortality.
METHODS: Pediatric patients with known hepatic arterial flow impairment were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were grouped by occlusive (HAT) and non-occlusive (HAS/SASS) arterial flow reduction. Patients with HAT were further divided in two groups based on the estimated maximal hepatic artery occlusion time ≤8 and >8 hours.
RESULTS: Impairment of hepatic arterial flow developed in 32 of 416 pediatric liver transplant recipients. HAT, HAS, and SASS incidences were 4.1% (n = 17), 2.2% (n = 9), and 1.4% (n = 6), respectively. Neither graft loss nor death occurred in the non-occlusive group. The probabilities of sepsis (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.14-2.53; P=.008) and graft loss or death (OR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.04-1.92; P=.046) were higher in the occlusive group. Patients with estimated maximal duration of hepatic artery occlusion ≤ 8 hours (n = 7; 41.2%) did not have ischemic-type biliary lesions and sepsis (P=.044 and 0.010, respectively) but had excellent 3-year graft survival compared with > 8 hours group (100% vs 40%; P=.037). Multivariate analysis revealed HAT manifestation by fever was associated with increased chances of graft loss or death.
CONCLUSION: Occlusive arterial complications impose higher risks of graft loss and death. Thorough arterial supply monitoring by Doppler ultrasonography and urgent endovascular arterial flow restoration may salvage both graft and the recipient.
