Title: A novel technique of proximal optimization with kissing balloon inflation in bifurcation lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) of bifurcation lesions poses a technical challenge with a high complication rate. Kissing balloon inflation (KBI) and proximal optimization technique (POT) are used to correct bifurcation carina after stenting. However, both may still lead to uncomplete strut apposition to the side branch (SB) lateral wall. Proposed herein, is a new stent-optimization technique following bifurcation stenting consisting of a combination of POT and KBI called proximal optimization with kissing balloon inflation (POKI).
METHODS: Bench and in-vivo evaluations were performed. For the bench visualization bifurcated silicone mock vessel was used. The POKI technique was simulated using a 3.5 mm POT balloon. For the in-vivo evaluation patients with angiographic bifurcation lesions in a native coronary artery with diameter ≥ 2.5 mm and ≤ 4.5 mm, SB diameter ≥ 2.0 mm, and percentage diameter stenosis (%DS) more than 50% in the main vessel (MV) were included. Provisional stenting was the default strategy.
RESULTS: In total 41 vessels were evaluated. The target vessel was left main in 9 (22.0%) patients, left anterior descending artery - in 26 (63.4%), left circumflex artery - in 4 (9.8%) and right coronary artery - in 2 (4.9%). The predominant type of bifurcation was Medina 1-1-1 (61.8%). Baseline proximal MV DS% was 60.0 ± 23.7%, distal MV DS% - 58.8 ± 28.9% and SB DS% 53.0 ± 32.0%. The application of POKI was feasible in 41 (100%) of the vessels. Post-PCI residual DS at proximal MV was 11.5 ± 15.4%, distal MV - 6.6 ± 9.3%, and SB - 22.9 ± 28.5%. Both procedural and angiographic success was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: POKI is a novel stent-optimization technique for bifurcation lesions. It showed excellent feasibility and success rate both in bench and in-vivo evaluation.
