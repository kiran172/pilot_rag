Title: Robotic D3 Partial Duodenal Resection with Primary Side-to-Side Anastomosis.

Abstract: Duodenal stenosis is a condition that can be related to several diseases, being either intrinsic, such as neoplasm and inflammatory stenosis, or extrinsic, such as pancreatic pseudocyst, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, and foreign bodies. Current treatments range from endoscopic approaches, such as endoscopic resection and stent placement, to surgical approaches, including duodenal resection, pancreaticoduodenectomy, and gastrointestinal bypass. Minimally invasive robot-assisted surgery is gaining importance due to its potential to decrease surgical stress, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative pain, while its instruments and 3D-vision facilitate fine dissection and intra-abdominal suturing, all leading to a reduced time to functional recovery and shorter hospital stay. We present a case of a 75-year-old female who underwent robotic D3 partial duodenal resection with primary side-to-side duodeno-jejunal anastomosis for a 5 cm adenoma with focal high-grade dysplasia.
