Title: Long-term outcome of prosthesis-patient mismatch after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Incidence and long-term clinical consequences of prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are still unclear.
METHODS: We enrolled 710 consecutive patients who underwent TAVR. PPM was defined as absent if the index orifice area (iEOA) was >0.85 cm2/m2, moderate if the iEOA was between 0.65 and 0.85 cm2/m2 or severe if the iEOA was <0.65 cm2/m2.
RESULTS: Among the 566 patients fulfilling the study criteria, the distribution of PPM was as follows: 50.5% none (n = 286), 43% moderate PPM (n = 243) and 6.5% severe PPM (n = 37). At 5-year follow-up, patients with severe PPM had a significantly higher incidence of the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction and stroke (p = .025) compared with the other patients. After adjusting the results for possible confounders, severe PPM remained an independent predictor of long-term adverse outcome (HR: 2.46; 95% Confidence Interval: 1.10-5.53). The independent predictors of severe PPM were valve-in-valve procedure and body mass index. Balloon-expandable valves were not associated with higher rates of severe PPM in comparison with self-expandable valves (8% vs. 5%, respectively, p = .245).
CONCLUSIONS: In our study severe PPM emerged as a risk factor for long-term major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events.
