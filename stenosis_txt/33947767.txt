Title: The Columbus steerable guidewire in neurointerventions: early clinical experience and applications.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report our early experience in using the steerable 'Columbus' guidewire, also known as 'Drivewire' in the USA, and its potential applications in neurovascular interventions.
METHODS: Neurointerventions in 36 patients (20 female, 16 male) using the steerable Columbus guidewire were recorded from August 2019 to December 2020 and included a variety of neurovascular procedures: Treatment of aneurysms (n=17), thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke (n=12), and others (n=7), such as treatment of stenosis and embolization procedures. Immediate follow-up with digital subtraction angiography and tracking of each patient's clinical outcome was performed.
RESULTS: In 35 out of 36 cases, the target vessel was reached with Columbus, including advancement of the appropriate microcatheter. In 14 cases, additional wires were used, mainly because of the nature of the procedures (eg, use of multiple wires/buddy wires or exchange maneuvers). In five cases, the Columbus wire was damaged by the operator and had to be replaced. Peri-interventional complications occurred in two patients, neither attributed to the Columbus guidewire.
CONCLUSIONS: The new Columbus neurovascular guidewire has the unique ability to be shaped within the patient. Currently available versions lack torquability compared with other available guidewires but offer tremendous support at the tip, allowing maneuvers which are impossible with other wires on the market.
