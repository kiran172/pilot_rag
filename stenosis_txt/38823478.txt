Title: One-hundred Consecutive Physician-Modified Fenestrated Endovascular Aneurysm Repair of Pararenal and Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysms Using the Terumo TREO Stent Graft.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fenestrated endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (FEVAR) has been widely applied for the treatment of pararenal (PAA) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA). If custom-made devices or off-the-shelf devices are not available, physician-modified endografts (PMEGs) are an alternative device option. Several different endograft platforms have been used for PMEG; however, minimal data exists on utilizing the Terumo TREO abdominal stent graft system in this setting. The purpose of this study was to evaluate our single-center experience treating PAA and TAAA, with a physician-modified FEVAR, using the Terumo TREO platform.
METHODS: A prospective database of consecutive patients with PAA and TAAA treated at a single center, with a FEVAR, utilizing a PMEG device between March 2021 and September 2023 was queried for those having a Terumo TREO device implanted. The demographics, operative details, and postoperative complications were analyzed. The rates of technical success, type I or III endoleak, branch vessel status, reintervention, and 2-year survival were also assessed.
RESULTS: Of the 153 patients who underwent FEVAR with a PMEG device during the study period, 100 had repair using a Terumo TREO stent graft. The mean age of the cohort was 73.7 ± 7.0 years with the majority suffering from hypertension (n = 94, 94%), coronary artery disease (n = 51, 51%), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n = 40, 40%). Thirty-four patients (34%) had a prior failed EVAR device in place. The mean aneurysm size was 66.0 ± 13.7 mm, with 58 (50%) patients classified as PAA and 30 (30%) patients as an extent IV TAAA. Six (6%) patients presented with symptomatic/ruptured aneurysms. The average number of target arteries incorporated per patient was 3.8 ± 0.6. The overall technical success was 99%, procedure time was 218 ± 116 min, contrast volume was 82 ± 21 mL, and cumulative air kerma was 3,054 ± 1,560 mGy. Postoperative complications were present in 20 patients (20%), and 2 patients (2%) died within 30 days. Rates of type I or III endoleak, branch vessel stenosis or occlusion, and reintervention were 2%, 1%, and 7%, respectively. The two-year overall survival was 87%.
CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of PAA and the extent IV TAAA using a physician-modified fenestrated Terumo TREO endograft is safe and effective. This large, early experience using the Terumo TREO platform supports preferential use of this device in this setting due to the device design and low likelihood of type I or III endoleak.
