Title: Digital Gangrene is a Rare Presentation of Takayasu's Arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu's arteritis is a chronic large vessel vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its major branches such as brachiocephalic, carotid, subclavian, vertebral, renal, coronary and pulmonary arteries. It most commonly occurs in female at child bearing age and female to male ratio is 8:2. Initial presentations of Takayasu's arteritis may be nonspecific like fever, malaise, weakness, fatigue, arthralgia, myalgia and weight loss but in advanced stage there may be features of vascular inflammation like segmental stenosis, occlusion, dilatation and/or aneurysm. It is a sub acute process over months to years and usually with good collateral formation. So, critical limb ischemia due to acute onset of vascular stenosis is very rare. Here we are reporting a case of a 50-year- old male patient who presented with digital gangrene due to critical limb ischemia. Though the age of onset was at 50 years and the patient lacks clinical features like constitutional symptoms, bruit, claudication, asymmetrical blood pressure, the patient was diagnosed as a case of Takayasus's arteritis. The patient dramatically improved with oral glucocorticoid treatment. Although rare, takayasu's arteritis can presents only with digital gangrene without having other clinical features. The physicians should be aware of this unusual but limb threatening presentation and more studies are needed to find out the exact mechanism of this presentation.
