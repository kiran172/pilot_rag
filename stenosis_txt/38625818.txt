Title: Long-term outcomes of intestinal penetrating Crohn's disease following successful nonoperative management.

Abstract: There is a paucity of data on the surgical or medical treatment for abscess/fistula complicating Crohn's disease after successful nonsurgical management. We conducted a cohort study to investigate the long-term outcomes and the risk factors for the requirement of subsequent surgical intervention in Crohn's disease patients with complicating fistulas/abscess following successful nonsurgical management. Data were collected on penetrating Crohn's disease experiencing successful nonsurgical treatment between December 2012 and December 2021. Long-term outcomes and risk factors of surgery were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis, and subgroup analysis was performed based on penetrating phenotype including abscess, fistula, and phlegmon. A total of 523 penetrating Crohn's disease patients; there were 390, 125, and 60 patients complicated with fistulas, abscess, and phlegmon, respectively. Long-term outcomes showed that BMI < 18.5 (kg/m 2 ), the recurrent abscess, and stricture were independent risk factors of surgery. Biologics and resolution of abscess were independent protective factors of surgery. Furthermore, in 399 patients undergoing early surgery, stricture and BMI < 18.5 (kg/m 2 ) were independent risk factors, and biologics and abscess resolution were protective of the early surgery. Subgroup analysis based on fistula, abscess, and phlegmon phenotype also demonstrated that concomitant stricture was an independent risk factor and the use of biologics was protective of surgical resection. Our data indicate that biologics can delay the requirement of surgery and may be given to patients with penetrating complicating Crohn's disease who have been successfully treated nonoperatively, but surgical resection should be considered in the setting of malnutrition and stenosis formation.
