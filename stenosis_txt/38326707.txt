Title: Long-Term Resveratrol Intake for Cognitive and Cerebral Blood Flow Impairment in Carotid Artery Stenosis/Occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid artery stenosis or occlusion (CASO) is a causative disease of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) attributed to cerebral hypoperfusion, even without the development of symptomatic ischemic stroke. Preclinically, resveratrol has been demonstrated to play an important role in improving cognitive function in rodent CASO models. This study investigated the association between long-term resveratrol intake and improvements in cognitive and cerebral hemodynamic impairments in patients with CASO.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted on patients with asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis of â‰¥50% or occlusion who underwent 15O-gas positron emission tomography (15O-gas PET) and neuropsychological tests such as Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale 13 (ADAS-Cog) twice between July 2020 and March 2022 allowing >125-day interval. Patients were administered 30 mg/day resveratrol after the first 15O-gas PET and neuropsychological tests were compared with those who were not.
RESULTS: A total of 79 patients were enrolled in this study; 36 received resveratrol and 43 did not. Over a mean follow-up of 221.2 and 244.8 days, long-term resveratrol treatment significantly improved visuospatial/executive function (P=0.020) in MoCA, and memory domain (P=0.007) and total score (P=0.019) in ADAS-Cog. Cerebral blood flow demonstrated improvement in the right frontal lobe (P=0.027), left lenticular nucleus (P=0.009), right thalamus (P=0.035), and left thalamus (P=0.010) on 15O-gas PET. No adverse events were reported.
CONCLUSION: Long-term daily intake of oral resveratrol may prevent or treat VCI by improving the cerebral blood flow in asymptomatic patients with CASO.
