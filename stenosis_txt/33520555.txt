Title: Total Posterior Spinal Arthroplasty Systems for Dynamic Stability.

Abstract: Degenerative disease of the lumbar spine commonly develops with age and can cause debilitating pain or neurologic deficits. When minimally invasive treatments and pain management interventions fail to provide relief, the traditional treatment has consisted of decompression surgery followed by the possible need for lumbar fusion. A mechanical implant device, known as a Total Posterior Spine (TOPS) System, has been introduced as a potential dynamic alternative to fusion surgery following decompression. The device is a dynamic posterior arthroplasty via pedicle screw insertion that maintains mobility, flexibility, and range of motion by providing multiaxial, three-column stabilization. While currently approved for use in Europe, the device is undergoing clinical trials in the United States to determine efficacy and potential complications. This paper provides a comprehensive narrative review of this technique's mechanism, early clinical outcomes, and considerations for patient selection. A review of the literature identified both positive results and adverse effects. While TOPS' use shows excellent potential, additional prospective trials are needed to determine this system's long-term complications.
