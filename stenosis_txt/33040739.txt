Title: Successful balloon valvuloplasty using direct puncture of the heart for pentalogy of Cantrell with complete ectopia cordis, low birth weight, single ventricle and severe pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: We present a 31 gestational weeks' premature baby whose fetal echocardiogram showed ectopia cordis, single ventricle and severe pulmonary stenosis. At 31 gestational weeks, an emergency caesarean section was performed, and his birth weight was 1756 g, SpO2 was 80% on 100% O2. Epicardial echocardiogram showed double inlet right ventricle, severe valvular pulmonary stenosis and no ductus arteriosus. The risk of surgery was very high, so we decided to perform balloon valvuloplasty by direct puncture of the heart. We punctured the apex of the ventricle using a 16-gauge needle under echo guidance, advanced the guidewire to the pulmonary artery and performed balloon valvuloplasty. Soon after the procedure, the cyanosis improved dramatically. This is the first report of a transcatheter procedure performed by direct puncture of the heart for ectopia cordis with complex congenital heart disease.
