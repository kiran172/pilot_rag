Title: Moyamoya Disease-like Cerebrovascular Stenotic Lesions Are an Important Phenotype of POEMS Syndrome-associated Vasculopathy.

Abstract: A 41-year-old woman was diagnosed with polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, M-protein, and skin changes (POEMS) syndrome based on polyneuropathy, hepatosplenomegaly, sclerotic bone lesions, IgA-Î» M-protein, and an elevated level of serum vascular endothelial growth factor. One month after the initiation of lenalidomide-dexamethasone with prophylactic aspirin, she developed facial paralysis, dysarthria, and left hemiplegia. Multiple cerebral infarctions and internal carotid artery stenosis were detected. Five months after switching to pomalidomide-dexamethasone, she again developed cerebral infarction. Progressed stenotic lesions in the bilateral internal carotid artery terminal portions were detected, showing a moyamoya disease-like appearance. Quasi-moyamoya disease can be an important phenotype of systemic vasculopathies of POEMS syndrome.
