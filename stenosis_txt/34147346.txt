Title: [Eosinophilic esophagitis. A not so rare clinical case].

Abstract: Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic disease of multifactorial aetiology locally mediated immune in which the form of presentation varies according to the age of the patient, being mainly signs of esophageal dysfunction. Diagnosis is made by histological criteria and treatment is based on diet and topical corticosteroid therapy and, in the event of stenosis, dilations are performed. An early diagnosis slows down the evolution, reduces complications and improves the prognosis.
