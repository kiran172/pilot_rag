Title: Trends in transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement in the United States, 2008-2018.

Abstract: We conducted a retrospective study using the NIS database from 2008 to 2018 to examine the most contemporary national hospitalization trends of transcatheter (TAVR) and surgical (SAVR) aortic valve replacement regarding volume, patient and hospital demographics and economics, resource utilization, total cost of stay, and in-hospital mortality. We demonstrate that TAVR procedures have been performed on a slow by steadily diversifying patient population while volume has grown significantly, while in-hospital mortality, length of stay, discharge home, and costs have improved, whereas these metrics have generally remained stable for SAVR. These trends will likely drive continued TAVR adoption, greatly expanding the overall aortic stenosis patient population eligible for AVR.
