Title: A novel case of tracheal deviation secondary to percutaneous tracheostomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This is a novel case of iatrogenic airway stenosis and tracheal deviation in a patient with previous percutaneous dilational tracheostomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: This 65-year-old male presented with a short segment of combined flap-valve stenosis and tracheomalacia, with right tracheal deviation distal to the stenosis. Clinical staging of the stenosis corresponded to a Cotton-Meyer grade III and McCaffrey stage III. Tracheal resection and primary reconstruction was performed by thoracic surgery and otolaryngology.
CONCLUSION: No cases have reported both stenosis and tracheal deviation as a result of iatrogenic intervention. The nature of this injury highlights a need for rigour in approaching tracheostomy.
