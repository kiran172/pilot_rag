Title: Clinical Outcomes Following Transcatheter Mitral Valve-in-Valve Replacement Using a Meril Myval Transcatheter Heart Valve.

Abstract: AIM: Transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve (TMViV) replacement for degenerated surgically implanted bioprosthetic valves has been described by both transseptal and transapical approaches. The balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter valve (Meril Life Sciences, Vapi, India) is commonly used for transcatheter valve-in-valve procedures in India. This study aimed to report in-hospital, 30-day, and 1-year outcomes of Myval patients who underwent TMViV in a single tertiary care centre in India.
METHODS: Symptomatic patients with surgical bioprosthetic mitral valve failure with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III-IV symptoms, despite optimal medical therapy and high or very high risk for redo surgery, were assigned to TMViV following heart team discussions. Data were retrospectively collected and outcomes assessed.
RESULTS: Twenty patients were treated, with mean age 64.4 years, 60% were female, and mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) predicted risk of operative mortality score was 8.1. The failure mechanism was combined stenosis and regurgitation in 60% of patients. Technical success was achieved in 100% of patients. The mean postprocedure and 30-day gradients were 4.6±2.7 and 6.3±2.1, respectively. None of them had significant valvular or paravalvular leaks or left ventricular outflow tract obstruction. All-cause mortality at 1 year was 10%, and all survivors were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I or II.
CONCLUSION: TMViV replacement with a Meril Myval can be safely performed with high technical success, and low 30-day and 1-year mortality.
