Title: [Comparison of diagnostic efficacy of different classification criteria for Takayasu arteritis in Chinese patients].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic efficiency of the 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification criteria for Takayasu arteritis (TA) and the 2022 ACR classification criteria for TA in Chinese populations.
METHODS: The clinical and imaging data of TA patients and patients with arterial stenosis or occlusion caused by atherosclerosis who were admitted to Peking University Third Hospital from May 2012 to May 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical diagnosis of TA by two rheumatologists were defined as the gold standard. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve (AUC) of the above two classification criteria were compared. In addition, this study also attempted to apply new imaging modalities, such as color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS), computed tomography angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) in the 1990 ACR classification criteria to find whether this approach would improve the diagnostic efficiency. At the same time, the imaging features of the two groups were compared.
RESULTS: The sensitivity (91.75%), positive predictive value (94.68%), negative predictive value (92.79%), accuracy (93.66%) and AUC (0.979) of the 2022 ACR TA classification criteria were better than those of the 1990 ACR TA classification criteria (45.36%, 91.67%, 66.24%, 72.20% and 0.855, respectively). In addition, we included new imaging modalities, such as CDUS, CTA, MRA and PET/CT in the 1990 ACR TA classification criteria, and the sensitivity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, accuracy and AUC were significantly improved, which were 63.92%, 92.54%, 74.64%, 80.49% and 0.959, respectively, but still lower than those of the 2022 ACR classification criteria of TA (P &lt; 0.001). The TA patients had more arterial stenosis (P=0.030), while the atherosclerosis patients had more arterial occlusion (P=0.021). There was no significant difference in arterial aneurysm or dissection (P=0.171). The TA patients had more involvement of â‰¥3 arteries (P=0.013), while the atherosclerosis patients had more unique artery involvement (P=0.011).
CONCLUSION: Compared with the 1990 ACR classification criteria for TA, the 2022 ACR classification criteria had higher diagnostic efficiency and might be more sui-table for the Chinese populations. Using more imaging modalities would improve the diagnostic perfor-mance of 1990 ACR classification criteria.
