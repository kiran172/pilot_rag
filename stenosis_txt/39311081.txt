Title: Transcarotid transcatheter aortic valve replacement utilizing monitored anesthesia care: a case report.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard of care for high surgical risk patients with aortic stenosis. The most common approach to TAVR is transfemoral utilizing monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia. On occasion, transfemoral access is not possible and alternative access to TAVR is required. Herein, we describe the case of a patient undergoing a transcarotid approach to TAVR with regional anesthesia and monitored anesthesia care utilizing a multidisciplinary heart team.
