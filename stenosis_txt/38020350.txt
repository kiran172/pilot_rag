Title: Giant stone in a urinary bladder diverticulum in a 69-year-old male: a case report.

Abstract: The stone formation could occur due to urine stasis in the bladder diverticulum. However, the stones are usually smaller in size and can pass spontaneously. However, a giant stone inside vesical diverticulum is considered a rare entity. We report a 69-year-old male, with a two-year history of lower urinary tract symptoms along with a recurrence of urinary tract infection. An abdominal computed tomography scan revealed the presence of a giant bladder diverticulum and a large bladder stone. The patient underwent a transurethral bladder neck incision followed by diverticulectomy with stone extraction. The diverticulum size measures 6x4x3.8 cm and diverticulum stone size of 4x3x3 cm. Fortunately, the patient recovered well after the operation. In conclusion, giant stones inside large vesical diverticulum are a rare occurrence and should be considered in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms. Early diagnosis and optimal management of the obstruction are the principles to prevent long-term complications.
