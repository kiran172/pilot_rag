Title: Improving Diagnostic Yield in Indeterminate Biliary Strictures.

Abstract: Indeterminate biliary strictures are defined as a narrowing of the bile duct that cannot be differentiated as malignant or benign after performing cross-sectional imaging and an ERCP. Identifying the etiology of a bile duct stricture is the single most important step in determining whether a complex and potentially morbid surgical resection is warranted. Due to this diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma, new technologies, laboratory tests, and procedures are emerging to solve this problem.
