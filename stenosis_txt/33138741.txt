Title: Intravascular ultrasound in the diagnosis and treatment of central venous diseases.

Abstract: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been used extensively in coronary applications. Its use in venous applications has increased as endovascular therapy has increasingly become the mainstay therapy for central venous diseases. IVUS has been used for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in managing venous stenotic disease, venous occlusive disease, and IVC filter placement and removal. IVUS has been proven to be effective in providing detailed measurement of the venous anatomy, which aid in determining the appropriate size and the approach for venous stent placement. In IVC filter placement, IVUS can provide detailed measurement and guide IVC filter placement in emergent and critical care settings. It also has certain utility in filter removal. At any rate, to date there are only a few studies examining its impact on patient outcomes. Prospective randomized controlled trials are warranted in the future.
