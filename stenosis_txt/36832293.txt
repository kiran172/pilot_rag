Title: Role of Preoperative Ultrasound Shear-Wave Elastography and Radiofrequency-Based Arterial Wall Tracking in Assessing the Vulnerability of Carotid Plaques: Preliminary Results.

Abstract: We aimed at evaluating the ability of point shear-wave elastography (pSWE) and of a radiofrequency (RF) echo-tracking-based method in preoperatively assessing the vulnerability of the carotid plaque in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for significant asymptomatic stenosis. All patients who underwent CEA from 03/2021 to 03/2022 performed a preoperative pSWE and an RF echo-based wall evaluation of arterial stiffness using an Esaote MyLab ultrasound system (EsaoteTM, Genova, Italy) with dedicated software. The data derived from these evaluations (Young's modulus (YM), augmentation index (AIx), pulse-wave velocity (PWV)) were correlated with the outcome of the analysis of the plaque removed during the surgery. Data were analyzed on 63 patients (33 vulnerable and 30 stable plaques). In stable plaques, YM was significantly higher than in vulnerable plaques (49.6 + 8.1 kPa vs. 24.6 + 4.3 kPa, p = 0.009). AIx also tended to be slightly higher in stable plaques, even if it was not statistically significant (10.4 + 0.9% vs. 7.7 + 0.9%, p = 0.16). The PWV was similar (12.2 + 0.9 m/s for stable plaques vs. 10.6 + 0.5 m/s for vulnerable plaques, p = 0.16). For YM, values &gt;34 kPa had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 73.3% in predicting plaque nonvulnerability (area under the curve = 0.66). Preoperative measurement of YM by means of pSWE could be a noninvasive and easily applicable tool for assessing the preoperative risk of plaque vulnerability in asymptomatic patients who are candidates for CEA.
