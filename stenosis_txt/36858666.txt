Title: Characteristics of Radial Artery Coronary Bypass Graft Failure and Outcomes Following Subsequent Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: When patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), targeting the native vessel is preferred. Studies informing such recommendations are based predominantly on saphenous vein graft (SVG) PCI. There are few data regarding arterial graft intervention, particularly to a radial artery (RA) graft.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report the characteristics of arterial graft stenoses and evaluate the feasibility of RA PCI.
METHODS: This study included 2,780 consecutive patients with prior CABG undergoing PCI between 2005 and 2018 who were prospectively enrolled in the MIG (Melbourne Interventional Group) registry. Data were stratified by PCI target vessel. RA graft PCI was compared with both native vessel (native PCI) and SVG PCI. Internal mammary graft PCI data were reported. The primary outcome was 3-year mortality.
RESULTS: Overall, 1,928 patients (69.4%) underwent native PCI, 716 (25.6%) SVG PCI, 86 (3.1%) RA PCI, and 50 (1.8%) internal mammary graft PCI. Compared with SVG PCI, the RA PCI cohort presented earlier after CABG, less frequently had acute coronary syndrome, and more commonly had ostial or distal anastomosis intervention (P < 0.005 for all). Compared with patients who underwent native PCI, those who underwent RA PCI were more likely to have diabetes and peripheral vascular disease (P < 0.001 for both) and to present with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (P = 0.010). The RA PCI group had no perforations or in-hospital myocardial infarctions, though no significant difference was found in periprocedural outcomes compared with either native or SVG PCI. No differences were found between RA PCI and either native or SVG PCI in 30-day outcomes or 3-year mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: Presenting and lesion characteristics differed between patients undergoing arterial compared with SVG PCI, implying a varied pathogenesis of graft stenosis. RA PCI appears feasible, safe, and where anatomically suitable, may be a viable alternative to native PCI.
