Title: Renal Transplant Anastomotic Pseudoaneurysm and Stenosis at the Proximal Transplant Renal Artery and Worse Renal Blood Flow After Stent Placement.

Abstract: A 60-year-old man with a history of end-stage renal disease received renal transplant and had decreasing renal function 4 months later. Nuclear medicine renal flow and functional study showed severely decreased blood flow and decreased function of the right renal allograft. There was focal increased radiotracer uptake at blood flow phase around the anastomosis of the renal allograft artery and the right external iliac artery. CT angiogram revealed right external iliac artery pseudoaneurysm. Interventional radiology angiography reconfirmed the pseudoaneurysm and revealed stenosis at the proximal transplant renal artery. After stent placement, however, there was worse renal allograft blood flow.
