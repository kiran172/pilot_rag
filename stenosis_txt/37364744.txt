Title: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty or stenting of petrous and cavernous internal carotid artery stenosis - a systematic review.

Abstract: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and stenting have been used for the treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis over the past two decades. A systematic review was performed to understand the efficacy of PTA and/or stenting for petrous and cavernous ICA stenosis. In total, 151 patients (mean age 64.9) met criteria for analysis, 117 (77.5%%) were male and 34 (22.5%) were female. Of the 151 patients, 35 of them (23.2%) had PTA, and 116 (76.8%) had endovascular stenting. Twenty-two patients had periprocedural complications. There was no significant difference in the complication rates between the PTA (14.3%) and stent (14.7%) groups. Distal embolism was the most common periprocedural complication. Average clinical follow up for 146 patients was 27.3 months. Eleven patients (7.5%) out of 146 had retreatment. The treatment of petrous and cavernous ICA with PTA and stenting has relatively significant procedure related complication rates and adequate long-term patency.
