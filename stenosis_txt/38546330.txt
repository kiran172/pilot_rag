Title: Coronary Artery Disease Assessment via On-Site CT Fractional Flow Reserve in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Purpose To examine the clinical feasibility of workstation-based CT fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) for coronary artery disease (CAD) evaluation during preprocedural planning in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Materials and Methods In this retrospective single-center study, 434 patients scheduled for TAVR between 2018 and 2020 were screened for study inclusion; a relevant proportion of patients (35.0% [152 of 434]) was not suitable for evaluation due to insufficient imaging properties. A total of 112 patients (mean age, 82.1 years ± 6.7 [SD]; 58 [52%] men) were included in the study. Invasive angiography findings, coronary CT angiography results, and Agatston score were acquired and compared with on-site CT-FFR computation for evaluation of CAD and prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) within a 24-month follow-up. Results Hemodynamic relevant CAD, as suggested by CT-FFR of 0.80 or less, was found in 41 of 70 (59%) patients with stenosis of 50% or more. MACE occurred in 23 of 112 (20.5%) patients, from which 14 of 23 had stenoses with CT-FFR of 0.80 or less (hazard ratio [HR], 3.33; 95% CI: 1.56, 7.10; P = .002). CT-FFR remained a significant predictor of MACE after inclusion in a multivariable model with relevant covariables (HR, 2.89; 95% CI: 1.22, 6.86; P = .02). An Agatston score of 1000 Agatston units or more (HR, 2.25; 95% CI: 0.98, 5.21; P = .06) and stenoses of 50% or more determined via invasive angiography (HR, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.41, 2.17; P = .88) were not significant predictors of MACE. Conclusion Compared with conventional CAD markers, CT-FFR better predicted adverse outcomes after TAVR. A relevant portion of the screened cohort, however, was not suitable for CT-based CAD evaluation.
