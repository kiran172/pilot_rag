Title: Evaluation of the left atrial function by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography in diabetic patients with obesity.

Abstract: Obesity and diabetes are risk factors for atrial cardiomyopathy and are, thus, deemed public health concerns. However, the effects of obesity on the left atrial (LA) function in patients with diabetes have not been determined yet. We sought to evaluate the effects of obesity on the LA function in patients with type 2 diabetes. Ninety-six consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes without significant coronary artery stenosis in selective coronary angiography were included in this cross-sectional study. Two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2DSTE)-derived longitudinal LA myocardial deformation markers were compared between 42 obese and 54 nonobese patients. The longitudinal strain and the longitudinal strain rate of the LA myocardium during the reservoir phase and the contraction phase were reduced in the obese patients with diabetes compared with the nonobese patients with diabetes in the unadjusted analysis. In the adjusted analysis, longitudinal strain and the longitudinal strain rate during the contraction phase and the longitudinal strain rate during the reservoir phase were decreased in the obese patients with diabetes. The reservoir and contraction functions of the LA as evaluated by 2DSTE were decreased in our obese patients with diabetes compared with our nonobese patients with diabetes.
