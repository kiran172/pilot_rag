Title: A Novel Marker Indicating Restenosis in Superficial Femoral Artery: C Reactive Protein to Albumin Ratio.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed to investigate the prognostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP) to albumin ratio (CAR) for predicting restenosis in superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions and its association with subsequent clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular intervention.
METHODS: The records of 685 consecutive patients who underwent endovascular intervention due to symptomatic peripheral artery disease were analyzed. Patients were divided into 2 groups, based on the CAR values. For each group, technical aspects of procedures and subsequent clinical outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: According to our study, patients with high CAR values had higher rates of restenosis (30.2% vs. 10.3%, P < 0.05) and mortality (31.3% vs. 12.9%, P < 0.05). The rate of lower extremity amputations was also significantly higher in patients with high CAR values compared to those with low CAR values (9.1% vs. 3%, P < 0.05). With respect to Receiver operating characteristic ROC curves of inflammatory markers, the area under the curve (AUC) value of CAR was statistically significant (AUC: 0.659; 95% confidence interval CI: 0.611-0.706; P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Our data showed that CAR is an independent predictor of restenosis and poor clinical outcomes in patients undergoing endovascular intervention.
