Title: Acute Aortic Dissection After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Acute aortic dissection (AAD) is a rare and potentially fatal complication associated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Owing to the paucity of existing institutional data, we sought to assess the incidence of postimplant AAD in patients who underwent TAVR at a single institution. All patients who underwent TAVR from 2013 to 2022 were retrospectively reviewed to identify those who possessed clinical or radiologic evidence of AAD after TAVR. Follow-up and survival data were retrieved for all included patients. A total of 4,317 patients underwent TAVR, of whom 9 (0.2%) sustained an AAD. These patients had a mean age of 80 years (range 53 to 92), mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons 30-day mortality risk of 5.7% (2.4% to 16.7%), and mean effective aortic valve area of 0.8 cm2 (0.4 to 1.5 cm2). Preoperative maximum aortic diameter was 3.9 cm (2.6 to 4 cm). Of these 9 patients, 6 (67%) showed evidence of Stanford type A dissection, whereas 3 (33%) were diagnosed with Stanford type B dissection. The most common causes of dissection were posterior annular rupture by the transcatheter valve (THV) (44%) and THV embolization or "pop-out" into the ascending aorta (22%). A total of 6 patients (66.7%), comprising 5 type A (55.6%) and 1 type B (11.1%) aortic dissections, died within 30 days of AAD. The median time to follow-up in those surviving TAVR with intraoperative AAD was 1,042 days (range: 648 to 2,666). Surviving patients were managed through thoracic endovascular aortic repair and medical management. In conclusion, in this highly selected cohort of patients, our experience indicates that AAD after TAVR is a rare but often lethal intraprocedural sequela of THV implantation, especially in cases of type A aortic dissection.
