Title: Carotid Near-Occlusion Stent Experiences.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Treatment strategy for near-occlusions (NO) of the internal carotid artery (ICA) is still controversial. In this study, we aimed to present the clinical results of stent placement in 50 patients with carotid artery (NO) stenosis that presented to our center, and upon which revascularization will be performed.
METHODS: Between 2014 and 2017, 50 patients with (NO) from 180 patients who had stents in the Interventional Vascular Neurology clinic were retrospectively studied. All the patients whether using or not using the proximal and distal protection device during the procedure were included. Patients had clinical neurologic evaluation, and underwent carotid artery radiologic imaging before the carotid artery stent (CAS) procedure. Balloon dilatation was applied before the stent procedure for patients that had advanced stenosis. Post-dilatation was applied with a balloon of appropriate size in case of residual narrowing. Findings such as bradycardia, hypotension, reperfusion hemorrhage during and after the stent placement procedure, as well as patients that developed restenosis within 12 months were recorded.
RESULTS: This study includes 50 (30 males, 20 females) patients that underwent carotid stent placement. The mean age of patients was 65 (28-81). Reperfusion hemorrhage was seen in 1 (2%) patient and the patient died in week 3. Ten (20%) patients complained of chills and tremor lasting less than 3 hours after the procedure. One (2%) patient had encephalopathy and agitation for less than 24 hours. Two (4%) patients had hypotension, and 15 (30%) patients had a headache for less than 24 hours. Three patients developed local hematoma at the site of the sheath, and were treated by applying compression. Restenosis signs in the stent site was observed in 6 patients (12%) in color Doppler ultrasonography of the carotid performed in the 6th and 12th months.
CONCLUSION: Although the innate process of ICA NO is not well known, it might be more frequent than currently considered. Especially after the diagnosis of ICA stenosis, it is important to make the right diagnosis in patients that have new ipsilateral symptoms. After the diagnosis is made, CAS, when performed by an experienced neuro-interventional team, seems beneficial with low complication rates.
