Title: Carotid Plaque Burden in Patient who Underwent Coronary Angiogram at Dhulikhel Hospital.

Abstract: Background Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death worldwide and is primarily caused by atherosclerosis. Carotid plaque and coronary artery disease share a common pathogenesis and risk factor. Carotid arteries are accessible through noninvasive imaging method. By characterizing the carotid arteries, it becomes possible to estimate the total burden of atherosclerosis, including that of coronary artery disease. According European Society of Cardiology (ESC) ultrasound of the carotid arteries should be considered, and be performed to detect plaque in patients with suspected chronic coronary syndrome. Objective To establish a relationship between coronary artery disease and carotid plaque. Method It is a cross sectional analytical study. Patients who underwent coronary angiogram at Dhulikhel Hospital from 1st April 2022 till 31st March 2023 were assessed for carotid plaque using carotid ultrasound. Chi square test was done to find the relationship between presence of carotid plaque and coronary artery stenosis of more than 50%. Positive predictive value and negative predictive value was calculated. Result Total number patient was 254 and the mean age was 61± 4.7 years. Out of which 85(33.5) had normal coronary artery, 143(56.3) had ≥ 50% stenosis and 120 (47.2) had ≥ 70% stenosis. Eight patients also had significant left main disease with ≥ 50 % stenosis. Carotid plaque was present in 121(47.6) patients. Out of 143 patients who had ≥ 50% stenosis in coronary angiogram, 104(72.7) patients also had carotid plaque which is statistically significant as p < 0.05. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 72.7% and negative predictive value was 84.7%. Conclusion This study establishes a relationship between coronary artery disease and carotid plaque, suggesting that the presence of carotid plaque may serve as an indicator of underlying coronary artery disease.
