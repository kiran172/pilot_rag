Title: [Low temperature plasma ablation and drug stent implantation for laryngotracheal atresia: a case report].

Abstract: This paper reports a case of acquired laryngosis stenosis treated by arc plasma ablation, drug stent implantation and balloon dilatation. The patient with difficulty in pulling out the tube after intubation 3 years ago was diagnosed with laryngotracheal stenosis and treated with tracheotomy, in order to extubation. Physical examination showed that the metal trachea cannula in front of the neck was in position, unobstructed, and can be seen slightly inspiratory three concave sign when moving. CT and laryngoscope showed subglottic stenosis or atresia. After the operation, the children successfully removed the tracheal tube, after half a year, the laryngotracheal was unobstructed, the children had smooth breathing, no shortness of breath, and normal activities and diet.
