Title: Endovascular treatment of complex vertebrobasilar junction aneurysms: A report of two cases.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Vertebrobasilar junction (VBJ) aneurysms are uncommon posterior circulation aneurysms. The treatment of VBJ aneurysms is challenging and in most cases, endovascular management is preferred over neurosurgery.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We describe two patients with VBJ aneurysms who underwent successful neuro-interventional procedures. The first patient had concomitant basilar fenestration and was treated with balloon-assisted coiling. The second patient had difficult vascular anatomy and an anterior inferior cerebellar artery-posterior inferior cerebellar artery variant arising from the neck of the aneurysm. Braided stent-assisted coiling was done with transradial access. Both patients had a good neurologic recovery.
DISCUSSION: Endovascular management of VBJ aneurysms is often complicated by anatomic difficulties like basilar fenestration, tortuosity of proximal vessels, atheromatous changes, and vascular stenosis. We achieved good post-procedure outcomes in both the patients. Optimal management of complex VBJ aneurysms often requires some modification to the usual interventional technique.
CONCLUSION: VBJ aneurysms are generally treated with endovascular techniques. The transradial access, although rarely used by neurointerventionalists, has some distinct advantages over the transfemoral access, especially when dealing with right-sided VBJ aneurysms with marked tortuosity of proximal great vessels.
