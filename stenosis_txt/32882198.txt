Title: Combined Aortic and Mitral Annular Enlargement With Fibrous Skeleton Reconstruction.

Abstract: In a pediatric population, congenital or acquired disease of the aortic and mitral valves may coexist and sometimes require replacement of both valves. Enlargement of aortic and mitral annuli may also be required. We demonstrate a challenging case that required upsizing of both prosthetic valves by redo anterior aortoventriculoplasty and patch enlargement of the aortic-mitral fibrous body. This case highlights the complexity and feasibility of enlarging both annuli in a reoperative setting, to implant larger prostheses.
