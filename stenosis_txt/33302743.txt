Title: Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Patients With Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the number of patients with idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) who have contracted coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the impact of the pandemic on patients' attitudes on seeking help and attending hospitals, as well as the delays in the offer of treatment from the local health care systems.
METHODS: A 29-question survey was distributed to an international mailing list of patients with subglottic stenosis to assess the patient experience during the COVID-19 pandemic.
RESULTS: A total of 543 patients with iSGS participated. Fewer than 1 in 10 patients with iSGS have experienced COVID-19 symptoms, which were predominantly mild to moderate, with only 2 hospitalizations. Most patients with iSGS (80.0%) have not been advised they are high risk for COVID-19, despite 36.5% of patients with iSGS being obese (body mass index of 30+). Delays to surgeries and in-office procedures have impacted 40.1% of patients currently receiving treatment, with 38.8% of patients increasingly struggling to breathe as a result. Anxiety and stress are increasing among patients, with 3 in 4 (75.2%) reporting they are anxious about travelling by public transport, contracting the virus in hospital and infecting loved ones (69.0% and 71.9%, respectively). Of greater concern is that 23.1% with increasing dyspnea state they are staying away from hospital despite their deteriorating health.
CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on the physical and psychological health of patients with iSGS. Surgeons managing cases of laryngotracheal stenosis need to offer appropriate support and communication to these high risk patients. During the pandemic, this should include self-isolation if they are dyspneic or on treatments that may have reduced their immunity. In addition, they should offer safe clinical pathways to airway assessment and treatments, if they become necessary. To minimize unnecessary travel, much of the clinical monitoring can be carried out remotely, using telephone or video-based consultations, in conjunction with local health professionals.
