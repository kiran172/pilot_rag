Title: Prevention of anastomotic stenosis for decellularized vascular grafts using rapamycin-loaded boronic acid-based hydrogels mimicking the perivascular tissue function.

Abstract: Abnormal proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) induces graft anastomotic stenosis, resulting in graft failure. Herein, we developed a drug-loaded tissue-adhesive hydrogel as artificial perivascular tissue to suppress VSMCs proliferation. Rapamycin (RPM), an anti-stenosis drug, is selected as the drug model. The hydrogel was composed of poly (3-acrylamidophenylboronic acid-co-acrylamide) (BAAm) and polyvinyl alcohol. Since phenylboronic acid reportedly binds to sialic acid of glycoproteins which is distributed on the tissues, the hydrogel is expected to be adherent to the vascular adventitia. Two hydrogels containing 25 or 50 mg/mL of BAAm (BAVA25 and BAVA50, respectively) were prepared. A decellularized vascular graft with a diameter of <2.5 mm was selected as a graft model. Lap-shear test indicates that both hydrogels adhered to the graft adventitia. In vitro release test indicated that 83 and 73 % of RPM in BAVA25 and BAVA50 hydrogels was released after 24 h, respectively. When VSMCs were cultured with RPM-loaded BAVA hydrogels, their proliferation was suppressed at an earlier stage in RPM-loaded BAVA25 hydrogels compared to RPM-loaded BAVA50 hydrogels. An in vivo preliminary test reveals that the graft coated with RPM-loaded BAVA25 hydrogel shows better graft patency for at least 180 d than the graft coated with RPM-loaded BAVA50 hydrogel or without hydrogel. Our results suggest that RPM-loaded BAVA25 hydrogel with tissue adhesive characteristics has potential to improve decellularized vascular graft patency.
