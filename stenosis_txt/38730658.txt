Title: Endoscopic Diagnosis of Small Bowel Tumor.

Abstract: Recent technological advances, including capsule endoscopy (CE) and balloon-assisted endoscopy (BAE), have revealed that small intestinal disease is more common than previously thought. CE has advantages, including a high diagnostic yield, discomfort-free, outpatient basis, and physiological images. BAE enabled endoscopic diagnosis and treatment in the deep small bowel. Computed tomography (CT) enterography with negative oral contrast can evaluate masses, wall thickening, and narrowing of the small intestine. In addition, enhanced CT can detect abnormalities outside the gastrointestinal tract that endoscopy cannot evaluate. Each modality has its advantages and disadvantages, and a good combination of multiple modalities leads to an accurate diagnosis. As a first-line modality, three-phase enhanced CT is preferred. If CT shows a mass, stenosis, or wall thickening, a BAE should be selected. If there are no abnormal findings on CT and no obstructive symptoms, CE should be selected. If there are significant findings in the CE, determine the indication for BAE and its insertion route based on these findings. Early diagnosis of small intestinal tumors is essential for favorable outcomes. For early diagnosis, the possibility of small bowel lesions should be considered in patients with unexplained symptoms and signs after examination of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract.
