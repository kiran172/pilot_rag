Title: Combination of Euro-Collins and University of Wisconsin Solution: An Effective and Economic Substitute for Organ Procurement.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Many types of preservation fluid were used in liver procurement. Undoubtedly, the gold standard is the University of Wisconsin (UW) solution. But the solution is expensive. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of combined acetated Ringer solution, Euro-Collins solution, and UW solution.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: All patients undergoing adult liver transplantation from cadaveric donor during January 2013 to December 2017 in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital were included in this study. Donor and recipient characteristics, preservation fluid, operative data, and postoperative outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients receiving liver transplants were enrolled into the study. The mean age of donors was 34.2 years. The mean total ischemic time was 420.93 minutes. In recipients, posttransplantation complications were the following: (1) primary nonfunction in 1 patient (0.98%); (2) early allograft dysfunction in 23 patients (22.5%); (3) hepatic artery thrombosis in 3 patients (2.7%); (4) hepatic venous outflow obstruction in 2 patients (1.96%); (5) biliary leakage in 1 patient (0.98%); (6) biliary anastomosis stenosis in 4 patients (3.92%); and (7) biliary nonanastomosis stenosis in 1 patient (0.98%). No inhospital mortality was occurred. Overall mortality rate is 7.8% (8/102). One-, 3-, and 5-year survival were 95.9%, 91.5%, and 88.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The combination of acetated Ringer solution, Euro-Collins solution, and UW solution is effective and economic for liver preservation. Further study should be conducted.
