Title: Minimally invasive transurethral laser incision for management of ectopic ureter orifice stenosis in adult patient.

Abstract: The aim of this report is to present our experience of performing transurethral laser incision for management of ectopic ureter orifice stenosis in adult patient. A 61-year-old male was presented with right flank pain. Computed tomography urography showed right complete double collecting system, upper moiety hydroureteronephrosis, and parenchymal thinning of the upper moiety. Cystoscopy showed right ectopic ureter orifice on the prostatic part of the urethra. Transurethral laser incision was performed at the 12 o'clock position of the stenotic orifice with Thulium laser. This report showed that transurethral laser incision was a minimally invasive procedure with good result.
