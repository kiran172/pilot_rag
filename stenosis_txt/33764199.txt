Title: A New Montgomery® Salivary Bypass Tube Placement Technique: Report of Procedures Performed on Patients With Tracheoesophageal Fistula or Pharyngoesophageal Stenosis.

Abstract: Salivary Bypass Tube is an important tool to prevent or treat some complications of laryngeal and hypopharyngeal surgery and its placement may prove difficult. In this article, we propose a new technique to simplify its management by using an Oral/Nasal Tracheal Tube Cuffed-Reinforced that allowed us to reduce operating times, complications related to prolonged general anesthesia, and the traumas on the tissues incurred during the forced positioning of the device with standard techniques.
