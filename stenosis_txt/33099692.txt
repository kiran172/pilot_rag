Title: Arterial collateral anatomy predicts the risk for intra-operative changes in somatosensory evoked potentials in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy: a prospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: During carotid endarterectomy (CEA), significant amplitude decrement of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is associated with post-operative neurological deficits.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between an incomplete circle of Willis and/or contralateral ICA occlusion and subsequent changes in intra-operatively monitored SEPs.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of a single center, prospective cohort of consecutive patients undergoing CEA over a 42-month period after reviewing the collateral arterial anatomy on pre-operative radiological imaging. The primary endpoint was an intra-operative decline in SEPs > 50% compared to the baseline value during arterial cross-clamping. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate a potential association between contralateral ICA occlusion, incomplete circle of Willis, and subsequent alteration in SEPs.
RESULTS: A total of 140 consecutive patients were included, of which 116 patients (82.9%) had symptomatic carotid stenosis of at least 50% according to the classification used in the North American Carotid Surgery Trial (NASCET) (Stroke 22:711-720, 1991). Six patients (4.3%) showed contralateral ICA occlusion, 22 patients (16%) a missing/hypoplastic anterior communicating artery (Acom) or A1 segment, and 79 patients (56%) a missing ipsilateral posterior communicating artery (Pcom) or P1 segment. ICA occlusion and missing segments of the anterior circulation (missing A1 and/or missing Acom) were associated with the primary endpoint (p = 0.003 and p = 0.022, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Contralateral ICA occlusion and missing anterior collaterals of the circle of Willis increase the risk of intra-operative SEP changes during CEA. Pre-operative assessment of collateral arterial anatomy might help identifying patients with an increased intra-operative risk.
