Title: Dynamic Myocardial Perfusion CT for the Detection of Hemodynamically Significant Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In this international, multicenter study, using third-generation dual-source computed tomography (CT), we investigated the diagnostic performance of dynamic stress CT myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) in addition to coronary CT angiography (CTA) compared to invasive coronary angiography (ICA) and invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR).
BACKGROUND: CT-MPI combined with coronary CTA integrates coronary artery anatomy with inducible myocardial ischemia, showing promising results for the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease in single-center studies.
METHODS: At 9 centers in Europe, Japan, and the United States, 132 patients scheduled for ICA were enrolled; 114 patients successfully completed coronary CTA, adenosine-stress dynamic CT-MPI, and ICA. Invasive FFR was performed in vessels with 25% to 90% stenosis. Data were analyzed by independent core laboratories. For the primary analysis, for each coronary artery the presence of hemodynamically significant obstruction was interpreted by coronary CTA with CT-MPI compared to coronary CTA alone, using an FFR of ≤0.80 and angiographic severity as reference. Territorial absolute myocardial blood flow (MBF) and relative MBF were compared using C-statistics.
RESULTS: ICA and FFR identified hemodynamically significant stenoses in 74 of 289 coronary vessels (26%). Coronary CTA with ≥50% stenosis demonstrated a per-vessel sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy for the detection of hemodynamically significant stenosis of 96% (95% CI: 91%-100%), 72% (95% CI: 66%-78%), and 78% (95% CI: 73%-83%), respectively. Coronary CTA with CT-MPI showed a lower sensitivity (84%; 95% CI: 75%-92%) but higher specificity (89%; 95% CI: 85%-93%) and accuracy (88%; 95% CI: 84%-92%). The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of absolute MBF and relative MBF were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.71-0.86) and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.74-0.88), respectively. The median dose-length product of CT-MPI and coronary CTA were 313 mGy·cm and 138 mGy·cm, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic CT-MPI offers incremental diagnostic value over coronary CTA alone for the identification of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease. Generalized results from this multicenter study encourage broader consideration of dynamic CT-MPI in clinical practice.
