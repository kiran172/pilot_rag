Title: Single-shot cryoablation of an epicardial inferoparaseptal accessory pathway: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Catheter ablation (CA) of epicardial accessory pathways (APs) can be performed via the coronary sinus (CS) system. Variable CS anatomy with complications of former CA procedures inside the CS venous system may require using alternative CA approach and technology.
CASE SUMMARY: We report the case of a 23-year-old man with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and history of aborted sudden cardiac death (SCD) and unsuccessful previous AP radiofrequency ablation (RFA). CS venography during the redo procedure revealed an early CS trifurcation with cardiac veins stenosis, thus with difficulties in maintaining cardiac veins' access and catheter manoeuvring inside CS venous system. The last office visit with electrocardiogram (ECG) performance was in 3â€‰months after the CA. Neither delta wave on the ECG nor any complaints/adverse health effects was detected at that time.
DISCUSSION: Successful CA of epicardial AP in patients with a high risk of SCD is essential. However, CS complex anatomy and changes after former RFA inside it may lead to CS venous system access limitations. Alternative CA approach and technology should be considered to ensure CS venous system cannulation and epicardial AP CA performance.
