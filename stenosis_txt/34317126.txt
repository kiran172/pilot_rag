Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis With Prosthetic Mitral Paravalvular Leak and Hemolytic Anemia.

Abstract: This report describes a successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement in an older patient with severe aortic stenosis, mitral paravalvular leak, and associated hemolytic anemia. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is worth considering as a first-line procedure in this high-risk patient because of its beneficial impact on reducing shear forces at the mitral valve. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
