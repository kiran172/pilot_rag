Title: Pancreatoduodenectomy for paraduodenal pancreatitis: a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.

Abstract: Paraduodenal pancreatitis (PP) is a rare type of focal pancreatitis involving the groove space. It mimics pancreatic head carcinoma, and its diagnosis and treatment are challenging. Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) has traditionally been the primary surgical treatment for duodenal stenosis or suspected cancer.We herein report a case of PP in a 65-year-old man. The patient was admitted to the hospital for postprandial epigastric pain and vomiting. A low-density mass between the uncinate process of the pancreas and the horizontal segment of the duodenum was suspected based on computed tomography findings. Both upper gastrointestinal radiography and gastrointestinal endoscopy showed an obstruction of the distal part of the descending duodenum. An operation was performed to release the obstruction and obtain a definitive diagnosis. A 3-cm mass in the groove area was compressing the third part of the duodenum, and PD was empirically performed. The final histopathological diagnosis was PP. Postoperatively, the patient developed anastomotic leakage of the gastrojejunostomy site with bleeding and was eventually discharged on postoperative day 51 after emergency surgery.PP should be considered as a differential diagnosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma or duodenal stenosis, and accurate preoperative diagnosis preserves the opportunity for conservative or endoscopic management.
