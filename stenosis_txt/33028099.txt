Title: Bilaterally Asymmetric Associations Between Extracranial Carotid Artery Atherosclerosis and Ipsilateral Middle Cerebral Artery Stenosis in Symptomatic Patients: A CARE-II Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the bilaterally asymmetrical associations between extracranial carotid artery atherosclerosis and ipsilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA) stenosis in symptomatic patients using magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging. Approach and Results: Patients with symptomatic carotid artery atherosclerosis were recruited from the Chinese Atherosclerosis Risk Evaluation, a multicenter study. All subjects underwent intracranial magnetic resonance angiography and extracranial carotid artery magnetic resonance imaging. Severe stenosis (stenosis ≥50%) of MCA, carotid moderate-to-severe stenosis (stenosis ≥50%), plaque compositions, and high-risk plaque on symptomatic side were evaluated in all subjects. Associations between ipsilateral MCA stenosis and extracranial carotid plaque features were evaluated. A total of 363 patients (mean age: 61.2±10.4 years old; 254 males) were included. In the left symptomatic cerebrovascular group (n=186), carotid moderate-to-severe stenosis (odds ratio [OR], 3.00 [95% CI, 1.03-8.79]; P=0.045), intraplaque hemorrhage (OR, 3.68 [95% CI, 1.21-11.19]; P=0.021), fibrous cap rupture (OR, 5.70 [95% CI, 1.60-20.31]; P=0.007), and high-risk plaque (OR, 2.95 [95% CI, 1.19-7.35]; P=0.020) were significantly associated with ipsilateral severe MCA stenosis, after adjusting for confounding factors. In the right symptomatic cerebrovascular group (n=177), severe MCA stenosis was significantly associated with ipsilateral carotid moderate-to-severe stenosis (OR, 3.98 [95% CI, 1.54-10.32]; P=0.004) but not with other extracranial carotid plaque features (all P&gt;0.05), after adjusting for confounding factors.
CONCLUSIONS: In the symptomatic arteries, vulnerable plaque features are independently associated with ipsilateral severe MCA stenosis on the left side, but this association is not found on the right side, indicating the associations of atherosclerotic disease between intracranial and extracranial carotid arteries are asymmetrical.
