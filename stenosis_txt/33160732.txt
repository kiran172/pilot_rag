Title: Tracheal Stenosis after Tracheostomy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Tracheal stenosis is a late and usually non-life threatening complication of surgical and percutaneous tracheostomies (PDT) as well as delayed endotracheal extubation.
METHODS: We undertook a retrospective review of all patients who underwent a surgical tracheostomy over a 10 year period. Patients were included in the study if they had CT or MRI imaging of the tracheostomy site both pre-operatively and six or more weeks post operatively. Patients whose imaging was not available were excluded (n = 3) as were those patients who still had a tracheostomy in situ (n = 8). In total 91 patients were included in the study. In the same period 1170 surgical tracheostomies were performed by the maxillofacial surgeons. The images were analysed by a radiologist and the degree of stenosis reported.
RESULTS: All 91 patients underwent a tracheostomy with a window. 83 patients did not demonstrate any stenosis. Looking at the remaining 8 patients with stenosis: 6 patients had stenosis of less than 25%, 1 patient had stenosis between 25-50% and 1 patient had stenosis greater than 50%. Both patients with stenosis greater than 25% had more than one surgical tracheostomy.
CONCULSION: We have shown that the risk of stenosis is 8.8%, lower than often quoted in literature, and when it occurs it is likely to be symptomatic only in severe stenosis. Our main risk of stenosis was repeat surgical tracheostomies which also seems to be linked to a greater degree of stenosis.
