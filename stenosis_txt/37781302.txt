Title: Effective superior vena cava isolation using a novel C-shaped approach.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Superior vena cava (SVC) isolation has been proposed as part of the ablation strategy for atrial fibrillation. However, circumferential isolation of the SVC can lead to late-onset complications, such as SVC stenosis.
METHODS: We describe a detailed observation of the SVC conduction pattern and present a newly developed approach for SVC isolation that involves creating a C-shaped non-circumferential ablation line while sparing the lateral segment.
RESULTS: Twelve consecutive patients were included in the study, all of whom achieved bidirectional block during the ablation procedure.
DISCUSSION: This approach to SVC isolation is effective and has the potential to reduce ablation related complications; however, larger studies and long-term follow-up is warranted to confirm these findings.
