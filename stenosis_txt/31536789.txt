Title: Chimney Stent Graft Technique for Endovascular Repair of Penetrating Atherosclerotic Ulcers of Abdominal Aorta with Bilateral Common Iliac Artery Aneurysms and Ectopic Right Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Ectopic renal artery (RA), a rare congenital anomaly, presents a challenge in open surgery and endovascular repair for abdominal aortic lesions. To preserve the abnormal main blood supply and renal function complicates the procedures requiring careful imaging measurement and well-designed therapeutic strategy. We report on a 68-year-old man with abdominal aortic atherosclerotic ulcers, bilateral common iliac artery aneurysms, and right ectopic RA stenosis that was successfully managed with antegrade chimney technique, resulting in well-excluded lesions and well-reconstructed renal blood supply without any complication. This endovascular procedure may be useful for repair of abdominal aortic lesions with ectopic RA in high-risk surgical patients.
