Title: Role of neuroimaging markers on predicting of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The goals of neuroimaging in idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) are the exclusion of mimickers and effective management of disease. In recent studies, several imaging markers have been identified as potential predictors of IIH.
PURPOSE: To investigate the predictive roles of novel radiological markers as the Meckel's cave area, alongside classical radiologic markers in identifying IIH such as the empty sella.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The patients were classified according to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure as the IIH group and control group. The observational, case-control study included 22 patients with IIH and 22 controls. Groups were compared for presence of empty sella, Meckel's cave area, fat area of posterior neck, fat thickness of scalp, presence of transverse sinus stenosis, and ophthalmic markers, such as increase of optic nerve (ON) sheath diameter.
RESULTS: In the IHH group, higher occurrences of increased ON sheath diameter, ON tortuosity, flattening of the scleral surface, and transverse sinus stenosis were observed (P &lt; 0.001, P &lt; 0.001, P = 0.046, and P = 0.021, respectively). Meckel's cave area and fat area of posterior neck were similar in both groups (P = 0.444 and P = 0.794).
CONCLUSION: Ophthalmic markers and transverse sinus stenosis could be utilized as radiologic features supporting early and precise diagnosis of IIH. However, enlargement of Meckel's cave area and measurements of fatty area of posterior neck are not helpful for diagnosis of IIH.
