Title: Corrosive ingestion managements in children.

Abstract: Corrosive (caustic) material ingestion remains a major health issue, particularly in developing countries. The management strategy after corrosive ingestion should be planned according to the signs and symptoms. The management of corrosive ingestion based on endoscopic grading, nothing by mouth, and barium studies should be abandoned. With the new management protocol, esophageal stricture can be predicted with high accuracy using the simple new prognostic DROOL score (≤ 4) rather than endoscopic grading, reduced by immediate oral feeding as soon as the patient can swallow saliva instead of nothing by mouth, diagnosed earlier (10-14 days) by fluoro-endoscopic balloon-assisted esophageal examination for patients with persistent dysphagia instead of relying on a barium study (≥ 21 days), and adequately treated by initiating balloon dilation earlier during the same anesthesia procedure. Fluoroscopically guided balloon dilatation with large balloons (18-20 mm) seems to be safe, with a low frequency of complications and a high success rate. If dilatation fails after a few months, esophagectomy and replacement surgery using the stomach should be considered. The increased risk of developing esophageal carcinoma after ingestion of corrosive substances should be kept in mind.
