Title: Left Atrial Thrombus in the Setting of Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: A 56-year-old man with no significant past medical history presented with exertional shortness of breath. Echocardiogram, cardiac magnetic resonance, and computed tomography showed mitral stenosis and a left atrial thrombus. Left atrial thrombus formation is a well-known complication of severe mitral stenosis that can lead to systemic thromboembolism. The patient underwent mitral valve replacement, left atrial thrombus resection, and left atrial appendage closure that resulted in significant improvement in breathing.
