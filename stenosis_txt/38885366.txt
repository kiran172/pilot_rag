Title: The impact of previous endoscopic treatments on functional outcome after cricotracheal resection.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Treatment options for benign subglottic stenosis include endoscopic techniques or open surgery. Although endoscopic treatment is less invasive, a considerable proportion of patients develop recurrent stenosis. Endoscopic pretreatments do not exclude patients from a later surgical repair; however, the impact of previous endoscopic treatment attempts on functional outcome after open surgery is unknown.
METHODS: All patients, who received a cricotracheal resection (CTR) between January 2017 and June 2023 at the Department of Thoracic Surgery, Medical University of Vienna, were included in this retrospective study. Patient characteristics, surgical variables and postoperative outcome including a detailed functional assessment were analysed.
RESULTS: A total of 65 patients received a CTR during the study period, of which 40 were treatment naïve and 25 had a median of 2 (range 1-9) endoscopic pretreatments. Less-invasive voice-sparing CTR or standard CTR were more often possible in treatment-naïve patients. In contrary, pretreated patients regularly required extended procedures (P = 0.049). Three or more endoscopic treatments resulted in a significantly lower mean fundamental frequency (F0) after open repair (P = 0.048). In addition, a trend towards smaller mean sound pressure levels, a higher voice handicap index, higher impairments in RBH scores (roughness, breathing and hoarseness) and a higher dysphagia severity index was found in pretreated patients. The respiratory outcome after surgery was comparable between both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple endoscopic pretreatments lead to worse voice quality after CTR. The impact of prior endoscopic treatment before surgical repair should be considered when discussing treatment options with patients suffering from subglottic stenosis.
