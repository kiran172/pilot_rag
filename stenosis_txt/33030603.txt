Title: Brain stiffness following recovery in a patient with an episode of low-pressure hydrocephalus: case report.

Abstract: The authors describe a follow-up to a case of a 19-year-old female with shunted aqueductal stenosis who presented with low-pressure hydrocephalus during a shunt malfunction. Shortly after management with CSF drainage at negative pressure, a magnetic resonance elastography scan was performed and revealed very low brain stiffness (high compliance). Here we present the case of the same patient seen 2 years later, now 21 years old, who again received a magnetic resonance elastography scan after receiving treatment for another shunt malfunction, this time with high intracranial pressure. This scan revealed recovery of brain stiffness to a near normal value for the patients' age. This observation suggests the low brain stiffness observed during the low-pressure hydrocephalus event is reversible. The authors discuss these findings in relation to biomechanical hypotheses of low-pressure hydrocephalus.
