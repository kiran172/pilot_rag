Title: Transanal endorectal or transabdominal pull-through for Hirschsprung's disease; which is better? A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: AIM: Hesitations concerning the long-term results of transanal endorectal pull-through (TEPT) due to prolonged anal stretching and resultant stricture and continence problems has been started to be questioned. This meta-analysis intended to compare long-term results between TEPT and transabdominal (TAB) pull-through techniques in the surgical management of Hirschsprung's disease.
METHODS: All publications between the years 1998-2021 in the PubMed, Medline, Google Scholar, Cochrane databases were reviewed. Retrospective and prospective comparative studies for TEPT, TAB as well as Laparoscopic-assisted TEPT (LTEPT) were included. Data included age at operation, postoperative constipation, enterocolitis, incontinence, stricture, and soiling rates.
RESULTS: Eighteen publications met the inclusion criteria for TAB and TEPT, and six for TEPT and LTEPT. Patients who underwent TEPT had significantly younger operation age than patients with TAB (SMD - 1.02, 95%Cl - 1.85 to - 0.18, p: 0.0168). Postoperative constipation (OR 0.39, 95% Cl 0.25-0.61 p < 0.0001) and enterocolitis (OR 0.65, 95% Cl 0.46-0.90, p: 0.0108) rates were significantly lower in TEPT groups. Postoperative incontinence (OR 1.06, 95% Cl 0.56-2.01, p: 0.8468), stricture (OR 1.97, 95% Cl 0.81-4.80, p: 0.1352) and soiling rates were similar between the two groups. Furthermore, when TEPT and LTEPT results were compared, incidence of incontinence (OR 7.01, 95% Cl 0.75-65.33, p: 0.0871), constipation (OR 1.95, 95% Cl 0.70-5.37, p: 0.199), enterocolitis (OR 3.16, 95% Cl 0.34-29.55 p: 0.3137), stricture (OR 1.33, 95% Cl 0.29-6.15, p: 0.7188) and soiling (OR 1.57, 95% Cl 0.57-4.31, p: 0.3778) were similar for both techniques.
DISCUSSION: TEPT is superior to TAB in terms of constipation and enterocolitis. Contrary to concerns, postoperative incontinence rates are not statistically different. However, further publications about long-term LTEPT results are necessary for more reliable conclusions.
