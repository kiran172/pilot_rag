Title: Comparison of the surgical outcomes of endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy in chronic dacryocystitis with or without previous bicanalicular silicone tube intubation.

Abstract: AIMS: To compare the outcomes of endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (En-DCR) in chronic dacryocystitis (CD) with or without previous bicanalicular silicone tube intubation (BSTI), and investigate whether previous BSTI influenced postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of medical records of CD patients (group A) who had previously undergone BSTI for nasolacrimal duct stenosis and an age- and sex-matched control group of CD patients (group B) without previous intubation receiving En-DCR from November 2017 to January 2022. Sixty-one patients (61 eyes) were included in group A and age- and sex-matched 122 patients (122 eyes) in group B. Dacryocystic parameters were measured by computed tomography-dacryocystography and surgical findings were recorded during surgeries. The surgical success rates of the two groups were compared at 12 months post-operation.
RESULTS: The mean horizontal, sagittal, and vertical lengths were 6.06 ± 1.24, 6.03 ± 1.44, and 8.05 ± 2.00 mm, respectively, in group A and 6.33 ± 1.25, 6.26 ± 1.19, and 10.40 ± 2.45 mm, respectively, in group B. There were no differences in the horizontal or sagittal parameters between the two groups. The vertical parameter in group A was significantly lower than that in group B. Scar formation in the sac was observed in 54 patients in group A but was absent in group B. At 12 months postoperatively, the anatomical and functional success rates were 88.52 % and 85.25 %, respectively, in group A and 92.62 % and 89.34 %, respectively, in group B, with no difference between the two groups.
CONCLUSION: Previous BSTI reduced dacryocyst vertical parameter and caused dacryocyst scar formation but did not affect postoperative En-DCR efficacy.
