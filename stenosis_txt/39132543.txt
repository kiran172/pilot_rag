Title: Severity of and Recovery From Anemia After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: An Analysis of the PARTNER Trials and Registries.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anemia is associated with increased mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR); however, data on the effect of the severity of and recovery from anemia on clinical outcomes are limited. This study examined the impact of the severity of and recovery from anemia after TAVR.
METHODS: Patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis across all surgical risk groups from the Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valves (PARTNER) I, II, and III trials and registries who underwent TAVR were analyzed. Baseline anemia was defined as mild (hemoglobin [Hb] level ≥11.0 g/dL and <13.0 g/dL for men and ≥11.0 g/dL and <12.0 g/dL for women) and moderate-to-severe anemia (Hb level <11.0 g/dL). Recovery from anemia was defined as an increase of ≥1 g/dL in the Hb level. Patients with missing Hb information and major bleeding within 30 days were excluded. The association of the severity of and recovery from anemia with clinical outcomes was analyzed using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: The Kaplan-Meier estimate for 1-year all-cause mortality was 5.4%, 8.2%, and 14.5% in patients with no, mild, and moderate-to-severe anemia, respectively (P &lt; .001). Recovery from anemia at 30 days occurred in 8.4% (229/2730) of all patients. Compared with those without baseline or 30-day anemia, patients with recovery from anemia had similar 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.02; CI, 0.50-2.08; P = .96), whereas those without recovery from anemia had higher 1-year mortality (hazard ratio, 1.82; CI, 1.17-2.85; P = .009).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing TAVR, moderate-to-severe anemia is independently associated with increased 1-year mortality, and recovery from anemia after TAVR is associated with favorable outcomes. Further efforts are needed to determine whether preprocedural correction of anemia improves post-TAVR outcomes.
