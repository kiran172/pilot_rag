Title: Bioprosthetic Valve Thrombosis and Obstruction Secondary to COVID-19.

Abstract: Patients with COVID-19 may present a hypercoagulable state, with an important impact on morbidity and mortality. Because of this situation pulmonary embolism is a frequent complication during the course of infection. We present the case of a patient recently discharged, after admission with confirmed COVID-19, who developed a pulmonary embolism and thrombosis of a biological mitral valve prosthesis, producing valve obstruction and stenosis. After 15 days of anticoagulant treatment, resolution of the thrombus and normalisation of prosthetic valve function was observed. This case supports current recommendations of administering full-dose anticoagulation therapy to COVID-19 patients with biological heart valve prosthesis, even after the acute phase of infection.
