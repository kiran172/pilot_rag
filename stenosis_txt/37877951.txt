Title: Achondroplasia Natural History Study (CLARITY): 60-year experience with hydrocephalus in achondroplasia from four skeletal dysplasia centers.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe the incidence and management of hydrocephalus in patients with achondroplasia over a 60-year period at four skeletal dysplasia centers.
METHODS: The Achondroplasia Natural History Study (CLARITY) is a registry for clinical data from achondroplasia patients receiving treatment at four skeletal dysplasia centers in the US from 1957 to 2017. Data were entered and stored in a REDCap database and included surgeries with indications and complications, medical diagnoses, and radiographic information.
RESULTS: A total of 1374 patients with achondroplasia were included in this study. Of these, 123 (9%) patients underwent treatment of hydrocephalus at a median age of 14.4 months. There was considerable variation in the percentage of patients treated for hydrocephalus by center and decade of birth, ranging from 0% to 28%, although in the most recent decade, all centers treated less than 6% of their patients, with an average of 2.9% across all centers. Undergoing a cervicomedullary decompression (CMD) was a strong predictor for treatment of hydrocephalus (OR 5.8, 95% CI 3.9-8.4), although that association has disappeared in those born since 2010 (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.2-5.7). In patients born since 1990, treatment of hydrocephalus with endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) has become more common; it was used as the first line of treatment in 38% of patients in the most recent decade. Kaplan-Meier analysis suggests that a single ETV will treat hydrocephalus in roughly half of these patients.
CONCLUSIONS: While many children with achondroplasia have features of hydrocephalus with enlarged intracranial CSF spaces and relative macrocephaly, treatment of hydrocephalus in achondroplasia patients has become relatively uncommon in the last 20 years. Historically, there was a significant association between symptomatic foramen magnum stenosis and treatment of hydrocephalus, although concurrent treatment of both has fallen out of favor with the recognition that CMD alone will treat hydrocephalus in some patients. Despite good experimental data demonstrating that hydrocephalus in achondroplasia is best understood as communicating in nature, ETV appears to be reasonably successful in certain patients and should be considered an option in selected patients.
