Title: A Contemporary Review of Surgical Approach and Outcomes in Pediatric Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: In order to define optimal resources and outcome standards for infant pyloromyotomy, we sought to perform a contemporary analysis of surgical approach (laparoscopic versus open) and outcomes.
METHODS: The National Surgical Quality Improvement Project Pediatrics Participant Use File (NSQIP PUF) was queried from 2016 to 2020. Utilization of laparoscopy was trended over time. Complication rates and length of stay were compared by operative approach.
RESULTS: 9752 pyloromyotomies were included in the analysis. The utilization of laparoscopyÂ steadily increased over the study time period (66% to 79%) and was associated with a shorter operative time. On multivariate regression, the utilization of laparoscopy was associated with a lower risk of overall complications, length of stay, and superficial surgical site infections. Overall complication rates were lower than previously reported (2.02%). The most common complication was superficial infection (1.2%).
CONCLUSIONS: In facilities reporting to pediatric National Quality Improvement Project, utilization of laparoscopy has steadily increased, and complication rates are lower than previously reported. Complication rates and length of stay were lower with the laparoscopic approach in this contemporary cohort. These results offer benchmarks for quality improvement initiatives. The laparoscopic approach should be standard in facilities performing this procedure.
