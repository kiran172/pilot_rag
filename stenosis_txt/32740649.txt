Title: Takayasu Arteritis Associated with Latent Tuberculosis Infection: A 39-Year-Old Woman Is the First Case in Gabon.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Takayasu disease is a rare disease affecting large vessels, particularly the aorta and its main branches. The affected arteries become partially occluded. The disease is more frequent in women under 40 years of age, with a ratio of women to men of 8: 1. CASE REPORT We report the case of a 39-year-old woman who was admitted to the medical ward at the Military Hospital in Gabon. She presented with multiple aneurysms, arterial stenosis, and a positive tuberculin skin test and was diagnosed with Takayasu disease associated with latent tuberculosis infection. This rare case is the first to be reported in Gabon, with a delay in diagnosis of approximately 7 months. CONCLUSIONS This is the first case of Takayasu arteritis that has been described in Gabon and has generated medical interest beyond the country regarding the diagnostic, therapeutic, and prognostic approach.
