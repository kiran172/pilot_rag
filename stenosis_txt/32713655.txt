Title: Impact of Combined Pre and Postcapillary Pulmonary Hypertension on Survival after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: We aimed to evaluate the association between pulmonary hypertension (PH) hemodynamic classification and all-cause mortality in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). PH is common and associated with post-TAVI outcomes in patients with severe AS. Although PH in these patients is primarily driven by elevated left-sided pressures (postcapillary PH), some patients develop increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) configuring the combined pre- and postcapillary PH (CpcPH). We analyzed severe AS patients with mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) measured by right heart catheterization (RHC) before TAVI between 2011 and 2017. PH hemodynamic classification was defined as: No PH (mPAP < 25 mm Hg); precapillary PH (mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≤15 mm Hg); isolated postcapillary PH (IpcPH; mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg, PCWP > 15 mm Hg, PVR ≤ 3 Wood units (WU); CpcPH (mPAP ≥ 25 mm Hg, PCWP > 15 mm Hg, PVR > 3 WU). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were used to test the association of PH hemodynamic classification with post-TAVI all-cause mortality. We examined 561 patients (mean age 82 ± 8 years, 51% men, mean LVEF 54 ± 14%). The prevalence of no PH was 201 (36%); precapillary PH, 59 (10%); IpcPH, 189 (34%); and CpcPH, 112 (20%). During a median follow-up of 30 months, 240 all-cause deaths occurred. Patients with CpcPH had higher mortality than those with no-PH even after adjustment for baseline characteristics (Hazard ratio 1.56, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 2.29, p = 0.025). There was no survival difference among patients with non-PH, precapillary PH and IpcPH. In conclusion, for patients with symptomatic severe AS treated with TAVI, CcpPH is independently associated with long-term all-cause mortality despite successful TAVI.
