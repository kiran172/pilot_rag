Title: [Effect and mechanism of glucocorticoids in preventing stenosis after esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the role and specific mechanism of glucocorticoids in preventing stenosis after esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD). Methods: Data of 81 patients [51 cases were male and 30 cases were female, aged (62.09±7.95) years] undergoing early esophageal cancer or precancerous lesions with a stripping range ≥3/4 circle hospitalized from January 2019 to February 2021 in Department of Gastroenterology, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University. They were randomly divided into the control group (n=23), oral prednisone acetate group (n=28) and/or combined with local injection Triamcinolone acetonide group (n=30). Analysis the stenosis rates, endoscopic stent dilatation times, the scores of the Atkinson classification and QLQ-OES18 after 12 weeks. Also the expression of carbohydrate sulfotransferase15 (CHST15) mRNA, TGF-β1 and Collagen-Ⅰ protein were compared by real-time PCR or immunohistochemistry. Results: The stenosis rates of the control group, oral prednisone acetate group and/or combined with local injection Triamcinolone acetonide group were 82.6% (19/23), 46.4% (13/28) and 20.0% (6/30) (P&lt;0.001); endoscopic stent dilatation times [M (Q<sub>1</sub>,Q<sub>3</sub>)] in these three groups were 2 (1, 3), 0 (0, 0) and 0 (0, 0) (P&lt;0.001). After ESD, the scores of the Atkinson classification and QLQ-OES18 in the three groups were lower than before (P&lt;0.001); and the expression of CHST15 mRNA in the three groups were 4.31±0.13, 3.44±0.07 and 2.84±0.21 respectively (P&lt;0.001). Compared with the control group, the expression of CHST15 mRNA in oral prednisone acetate group was down-regulated (P&lt;0.001), and was the lowest in oral prednisone acetate combined with local injection Triamcinolone acetonide group (P&lt;0.001). As CHST15 mRNA was down-regulated, the expression of TGF-β1 and Collagen-I protein was also down-regulated (P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Oral prednisone alone or combined with local injection of triamcinolone acetonide both can prevent esophageal stenosis effectively. Oral combined with local injection of glucocorticoid is particularly more effective. Glucocorticoid can reduce the expression of CHST15 mRNA, thereby inhibiting the expression of TGF-β1 and Collagen-I protein.
