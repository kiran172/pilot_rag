Title: Long-term prognosis and predictors of outcomes after negative stress echocardiography.

Abstract: Negative stress echocardiography (NSE) is associated with low cardiovascular morbidity and overall mortality. We aimed to determine the clinical and echocardiographic predictors of overall and cardiovascular outcomes following NSE. Patients who underwent SE between 2013 and 2017 were reviewed. Patients with a history of solid organ transplant or being evaluated for transplant, history of end-stage renal or liver disease, and positive SE were excluded. NSE results were divided into negative diagnostic if patient reached target heart rate (THR) and had no wall motion abnormality (WMA) at rest or stress; negative non-diagnostic if patient had no WMA but did not reach THR or if image quality was non-diagnostic; and abnormal non-ischemic if patient had a resting WMA not worsened at stress along with a personal history of coronary artery disease (CAD). New CAD lesion at 1 year was defined as ≥ 50% stenosis on cardiac catheterization. Of 4119 patients with SE, 2575 were included. All-cause mortality rate was 1.1%/year and CAD rate was 3.1%/year. Predictors of all-cause mortality were age, male gender, history of smoking and being selected for dobutamine SE. Predictors of a new CAD lesion at 1 year were male gender, diabetes, personal history of CAD and abnormal non-ischemic SE. We identified clinical and echocardiographic characteristics in a subset of NSE patients who are at higher risk for subsequent adverse events. These characteristics should be accounted for during the clinical interpretation of SE, and patients found at increased risk for morbidity and mortality warrant continued follow-up.
