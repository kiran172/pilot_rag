Title: Haptoglobin genotype 2-2 associated with atherosclerosis in patients with ischemic stroke.

Abstract: AIM: Ischemic stroke (IS) is multifactorial disease and therefore different genes and proteins play a role in its development. Haptoglobin (Hp) removes free hemoglobin and protects from iron-induced oxidative damage, inflammatory response, atherosclerosis and cerebrovascular diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate Hp genetic variants in patients with carotid atherosclerotic lesions and IS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 121 subjects with IS participated in the study, 81 male and 40 female.
RESULTS: Among 121 patients with IS, 79 had diffuse atherosclerotic plaques and stenosis. Hp genotype was statistically significantly associated with CDFI neck carotid artery stenosis findings (p = 0.006). Patients with Hp1-2 genotype had statistically significantly larger odds for atherosclerotic changes compared to those with Hp1-1 genotype, as well as those with Hp2-2 genotype.
CONCLUSION: This study has shown an association of the Hp2-2 genotype and atherosclerosis in patients with IS, indicating Hp2-2 genotype as a genetic biomarker for precision medicine and personalized healthcare.
