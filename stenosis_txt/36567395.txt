Title: Comparative Outcomes of TAVR in Mixed Aortic Valve Disease and Aortic Stenosis: A Meta-analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a suitable alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS). A high proportion of patients with AS have mixed aortic valve disease (MAVD) with mild or more concurrent aortic regurgitation (AR). Differential outcomes of TAVR among patients with AS and MAVD have not been well characterized. We compared 1-year mortalities following TAVR among patients with MAVD and AS.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis of studies published in PubMed/Medline. The primary outcome was 1-year all-cause mortality following TAVR among patients with MAVD vs. AS. Secondary endpoints were: (1) incidence of AR within 30 days following TAVR (post TAVR AR); and (2) 1-year all-cause mortality within each group stratified according to severity of post TAVR AR.
RESULTS: Nine studies involving 9505 participants were included in the analysis. At 1 year following TAVR, mortality was lower in MAVD than in AS; HR 0.89, 95% CI 0.81-0.98. The mortality advantage increased when pre-TAVR AR was moderate or more; HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.99. The mortality advantage was attenuated after correction for publication bias. There was a higher risk of post TAVR AR in the MAVD group; OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.20-1.90 but the impact on mortality of moderate vs. mild post TAVR AR was greater among patients with AS than in patients with MAVD HR 1.67 95% CI 0.89-3.14 vs. 0.93 95% CI 0.47-1.85.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with MAVD have similar or improved survival 1 year after TAVR compared to those with AS.
