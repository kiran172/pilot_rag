Title: Percutaneous Endoscopic Discectomy Via a Transforaminal Approach for L5/S1 Far-Lateral Disc Herniation Assisted by Intraoperative Computed Tomography.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical outcomes of a percutaneous lumbar transforaminal endoscopic discectomy (PTED) with intraoperative computed tomography (iCT) navigation for the treatment of L5-S1 far-lateral lumbar disc herniation (LDH).
METHODS: A total of 30 patients with L5-S1 far-lateral LDH who underwent PTED with iCT navigation from September 2016 to October 2020 were enrolled in this study. Outcomes were assessed using the visual analog scale pain score, the Oswestry Disability Index, the Japanese Orthopedic Association score, the EQ-5D-5 L and the modified Macnab criteria. Preoperative and postoperative complications were recorded.
RESULTS: The mean visual analog scale score for leg pain improved from 8.1 at baseline to 2.3, 0.9, 0.7 and 0.9 at 1 day, 1 week, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively, respectively (P < 0.01). The mean Oswestry Disability Index improved from 78.1% at baseline to 45.5%, 21.9%, 12.6%, and 11.7% at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively, respectively (P < 0.01); and the mean Japanese Orthopedic Association score improved from 8.6 at baseline to 14.2, 20.2, 24.4, and 25.6 at 1 day, 1 week, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively, respectively (P < 0.01). At 12 months postoperatively, the EQ-5D-5 L value significantly increased, from -0.061 ± 0.138 to 0.903 ± 0.064. The rate of a good or excellent modified Macnab result was 93% (26/28) at 12 months postoperatively. In the present study, combined L5-S1 foraminal stenosis tended to lead poor outcomes, which required more postsurgical treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: With iCT navigation, PTED is a feasible and effective minimally invasive surgery for L5-S1 far-lateral LDH.
