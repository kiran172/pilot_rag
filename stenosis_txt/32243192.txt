Title: Efficacy and Safety of TurboHawk Plaque Rotation Combined With Drug-coated Balloon in Treating Diabetic Patients With Lower Extremity Arterial Disease.

Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of TurboHawk plaque rotation system combined with drug-coated balloon in treating lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) of diabetes patients, a total of 145 diabetic patients with LEAD from March 2015 to September 2016 were recruited in our study. Lower extremity arterial disease was diagnosed by ultrasound and CT angiography (CTA). According to the surgical method, 65 cases underwent TurboHawk plaque rotation combined with drug-coated balloon (group A), 80 cases underwent simple drug-coated balloon expansion (group B). The characteristics of lesion, function test, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and postoperative complications were analyzed. All the patients were followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after operation. At baseline, there was no difference in all the characteristics between the 2 groups. The early postoperation minimum lumen diameter (MLD), lumen stenosis rate, and ABI in 2 groups both improved. As the follow-up time increased, patients in group A had significantly higher MLD and ABL value, as well as lower level of lumen stenosis rate, restenosis rate, late lumen loss, and target lesion revascularization (all P &lt; .05). Accordingly, functional testing revealed the 6-minute walk distance, 6-minute claudication distance, resting ABI, and post-exercise ABI in group A were significantly higher than those in group B (all P &lt; .05). Besides, major graft reintervention (4.62% vs 11.25%) and major adverse limb events (6.15% vs 12.5%) in group A occurred less frequently than group B (all P &lt; .05). In conclusion, the long-term effect of the combined approach was better than only drug-coated balloon in LEAD in Chinese diabetes patients.
