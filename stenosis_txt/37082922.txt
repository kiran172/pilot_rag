Title: Venous Outflow and Otosclerosis: An Unusual Case of Pulsatile Tinnitus.

Abstract: We report resolution of right-sided pulsatile tinnitus in a 44-year-old male who underwent stapedectomy for fenestral otosclerosis. Initial workup revealed a mixed hearing loss and absent stapedial reflexes consistent with ossicular fixation. CT angiography demonstrated near complete stenosis of the left-sided transverse and sigmoid sinuses and dominant contralateral venous outflow. We hypothesized that the dominant right cerebral venous outflow tract created turbulent flow that was conducted to cochlea. Successful stapedectomy was performed, and the pulsatile tinnitus resolved. This case report demonstrates evidence that the sound of turbulent blood flow can be conducted through bone and an instance where the perception of vascular tinnitus was eliminated with stapedectomy.
