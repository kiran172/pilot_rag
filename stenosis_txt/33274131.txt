Title: Frequency and Complications of Ileostomy.

Abstract: Introduction Ileostomies are life-saving procedures used for temporary fecal diversion in complicated cases of ileal perforation. However, an ileostomy is associated with several complications. The goal of this study was to determine the frequency and complications of ileostomy in the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, Karachi, Pakistan. Methodology We conducted a longitudinal observational study from July 2019 to July 2020. All patients older than age 12 receiving an ileostomy were included. Patient examinations were conducted on the first postoperative day and were assessed for hemorrhage and necrosis. Examinations were conducted on the seventh postoperative day to assess stoma retraction, stenosis, prolapse, and high-output fistula. Patients were monitored via follow-up in the outpatient clinic every 15 days to record any complications for three months until the reversal was performed. All data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 25.0. (Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Result A total of 84 patients who received ileostomies were included in the study. Most patients were male (n=62; 73.8%), and 22 were female (26.19%). Of the 84 patients in our study, 34 (40.48%) had tuberculous intestine, 23 (27.38%) had typhoid ileal perforation, 23 (27.38%) were trauma patients, and four patients (4.7%) had gangrenous appendicular perforation. 23 patients (27.3%) were discharged with no complications, and 61 patients (72.69%) developed complications. The most common complication was skin excoriation (19.4%), followed by wound infection (13%), nonfunctioning stoma (11.9%), prolapse and stenosis (6%), retraction (4.7%), high-output fistula (3.5%), parastomal hernia and necrosis (2.3% each), and hemorrhage (1.1%). Conclusion Ileostomy is a common and lifesaving surgical diverting procedure. It is still common in our clinic due to late presentation by patients who need the procedure. Complications are common but manageable. Therefore, it is essential to recognize these complications and manage them early to reduce the morbidity of the patients.
