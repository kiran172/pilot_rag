Title: Mediastinal Radiotherapy-induced Early-onset Valvulopathy in a 6-Year-old Boy With Hodgkin Lymphoma.

Abstract: Mediastinal radiotherapy for childhood cancers, particularly Hodgkin disease, has numerous potential adverse effects, including coronary artery disease, pericarditis, cardiomyopathy, valvular disease, and conduction abnormalities. The prevalence of valvular stenosis is relatively low, and regurgitation is more common. Mediastinal radiotherapy-induced valvular disease develops more than 10 years after radiotherapy. Here, we present a case of a 6-year-old boy with moderate to significant mitral stenosis + moderate mitral regurgitation and mild aortic regurgitation that appeared 1.5 months after radiotherapy and showed a progressive course.
