Title: Cardiac arrest with severe airway stenosis due to retropharyngeal haematoma secondary to Stanford type B acute aortic dissection.

Abstract: This was the case of a male patient in his 60s, who suddenly collapsed. When the ambulance team arrived, the initial waveform was pulseless electrical activity; accordingly, a supraglottic airway device was inserted, and the patient was immediately transported to a referring hospital. On arrival, the patient resumed spontaneous circulation, the patient was diagnosed with Stanford type B acute aortic dissection and was referred to the author's hospital, where diffuse swelling of the anterior cervical region was revealed. CT performed by the previous hospital revealed compression of the trachea. The cause of cardiac arrest was considered to be severe airway stenosis secondary to a retropharyngeal haematoma associated with Stanford type B acute aortic dissection. Stanford type B acute aortic dissection can be complicated by retropharyngeal haematomas, which can lead to airway obstruction and even cardiac arrest. This condition also requires careful airway examination.
