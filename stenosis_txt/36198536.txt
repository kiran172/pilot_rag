Title: [Myeloproliferative neoplasms and vascular diseases].

Abstract: Vascular diseases are a feature of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) with a driver mutation, such as JAK2V617F. There is growing evidence that clonal hematopoiesis with JAK2V617F (JAK2V617F-CH) is often complicated with vascular diseases, even in the absence of MPN onset. Such vascular diseases associated with the MPN driver mutation include arterial/venous thrombosis, atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and aortic aneurysm, and pulmonary hypertension. Murine studies have recently revealed mechanisms by which hematopoietic cells activated by the MPN driver mutation may promote thrombosis and vascular remodeling in deep vein stenosis, atherosclerosis, and pulmonary hypertension models. Furthermore, MPN driver mutations mediate various downstream molecules of JAK-STAT activation in neutrophils and macrophages, such as inflammatory cytokines, which may be candidates for preventing and treating vascular diseases in MPNs and JAK2V617F-CH.
