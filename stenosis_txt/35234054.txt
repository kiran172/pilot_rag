Title: Transapical transcatheter J-valve for aortic regurgitation in dextrocardia situs inversus.

Abstract: A 71-year-old lady with dextrocardia and pure aortic regurgitation was treated with transcatheter aortic valve replacement using the transapical J-valve system. Good clinical and echocardiographic results were demonstrated at one-year follow-up. Herewith we describe this simple, safe, and a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement option for this condition.
