Title: A New Minimally Invasive Method of Transverse Aortic Constriction in Mice.

Abstract: Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice is the most popular model to mimic pressure overload heart disease. In this study, we developed a convenient, quick, and less invasive new TAC mice model. Briefly, after anesthetization, endotracheal intubation was then performed, and the endotracheal tube was connected to a ventilator. The second intercostal space was opened and then the home-made retractors were used to push aside the thymus gently. A tunnel under the aortic arch was made and a segment of 6-0 monofilament polypropylene suture which had been threaded through a specifically modified blunted 26-gauge syringe needle was passed through the tunnel. A blunted 27-gauge needle was placed parallel to the transverse aorta and then three knots were tied quickly. After ligation, the spacer was removed promptly and gently to achieve a constriction of 0.4 mm in diameter. Five weeks after TAC, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and left ventricular dysfunction were observed. The mouse was anesthetized with pentobarbital (50 mg/kg) via intraperitoneal injection. Endotracheal intubation under direct vision was then performed and the endotracheal tube was connected to a ventilator. The second intercostal space was opened and then the home-made retractors were used to push aside the thymus gently. A tunnel under the aortic arch was made and a segment of 6-0 monofilament polypropylene suture which had been threaded through a specifically modified blunted 26-gauge syringe needle was passed through the tunnel.
