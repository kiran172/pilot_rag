Title: Countering Calcium Blooming With Personalized Contrast Media Injection Protocols: The 1-2-3 Rule for Photon-Counting Detector CCTA.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Photon-counting detector computed tomography (PCD-CT) enables spectral data acquisition of CT angiographies allowing for reconstruction of virtual monoenergetic images (VMIs) in routine practice. Specifically, it has potential to reduce the blooming artifacts associated with densely calcified plaques. However, calcium blooming and iodine attenuation are inversely affected by energy level (keV) of the VMIs, creating a challenge for contrast media (CM) injection protocol optimization. A pragmatic and simple rule for calcium-dependent CM injection protocols is investigated and proposed for VMI-based coronary CT angiography with PCD-CT.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A physiological circulation phantom with coronary vessels including calcified lesions (maximum CT value >700 HU) with a 50% diameter stenosis was injected into at iodine delivery rates (IDRs) of 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 g I/s. Images were acquired using a first-generation dual-source PCD-CT and reconstructed at various VMI levels (between 45 and 190 keV). Iodine attenuation in the coronaries was measured at each IDR for each keV, and blooming artifacts from the calcified lesions were assessed including stenosis grading error (as % overestimation vs true lumen). The IDR to achieve 300 HU at each VMI level was then calculated and compared with stenosis grading accuracy to establish a general rule for CM injection protocols.
RESULTS: Plaque blooming artifacts and intraluminal iodine attenuation decreased with increasing keV. Fixed windowing (representing absolute worst case) resulted in stenosis overestimation from 77% ± 4% at 45 keV to 5% ± 2% at 190 keV, whereas optimized windowing resulted in overestimation from 29% ± 3% at 45 keV to 4% ± 1% at 190 keV. The required IDR to achieve 300 HU showed a strong linear correlation to VMI energy ( R2 = 0.98). Comparison of this linear plot versus stenosis grading error and blooming artifact demonstrated that multipliers of 1, 2, and 3 times the reference IDR for theoretical clinical regimes of no, moderate, and severe calcification density, respectively, can be proposed as a general rule.
CONCLUSIONS: This study provides a proof-of-concept in an anthropomorphic phantom for a simple pragmatic adaptation of CM injection protocols in coronary CT angiography with PCD-CT. The 1-2-3 rule demonstrates the potential for reducing the effects of calcium blooming artifacts on overall image quality.
