Title: Reversal flow in the left anterior descending artery after internal thoracic artery grafting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The flow capacity of the in situ internal thoracic artery (ITA) is not necessarily sufficient and can be a cause of hypoperfusion syndrome. We present a catastrophic case of in situ ITA grafting for an isolated left main trunk obstruction 13Â years after the modified Bentall operation.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 33-years-old woman had undergone the modified Bentall operation. Coronary angiography showed a critical stenosis in the left coronary artery. The patient underwent emergency off-pump coronary artery bypass graft with the left ITA to the left anterior descending artery (LAD). On the 7th day, the patient had severe dyspnoea and hypotension. Catheter angiography showed that the ITA was patent; however, blood flow from the in situ ITA was delayed, and reversal flow from the apex to the proximal LAD was found. The patient underwent implantation of a left ventricular assist device.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant aortocoronary bypass to the circumflex branch will minimise the risk of hypoperfusion, especially for young patients without atherosclerotic disease.
