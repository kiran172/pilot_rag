Title: Association of the High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein-to-Albumin Ratio with Carotid Atherosclerotic Plaque: A Community-Based Cohort Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The inflammatory response is a pivotal factor in accelerating the progression of atherosclerosis. The high-sensitivity C-reactive protein-to-albumin ratio (CAR) has emerged as a novel marker of systemic inflammation. However, few studies have shown the CAR to be a promising prognostic marker for carotid atherosclerotic disease. This study aimed to analyse the predictive role of the CAR in carotid atherosclerotic disease.
METHODS: This community-based cohort study recruited 2003 participants from the Rose asymptomatic IntraCranial Artery Stenosis (RICAS) study who were free of stroke or transient ischemic attack. Carotid atherosclerotic plaques and their stability were identified via carotid ultrasound. Logistic regression models were utilized to investigate the association between CAR and the presence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques.
RESULTS: The prevalence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques was 38.79% in this study. After adjusting for clinical risk factors, including sex, age, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus (DM), and smoking and drinking habits, a high CAR-level was independently associated with carotid plaque (odds ratio [OR] of upper: 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.90, P = 0.004; P for trend = 0.011). The highest CAR tertile was still significantly associated with carotid plaques among middle-aged (40-64 years) or female participants. Notably, an elevated CAR may be an independent risk factor for vulnerable carotid plaques (OR of upper: 2.06, 95% CI: 1.42-2.98, P &lt; 0.001; P for trend &lt;0.001).
CONCLUSION: A high CAR may be correlated with a high risk of carotid plaques, particularly among mildly aged adults (40-64 years) or females. Importantly, the CAR may be associated with vulnerable carotid plaques, suggesting that the CAR may be a new indicator for stroke prevention.
