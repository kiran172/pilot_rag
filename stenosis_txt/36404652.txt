Title: [The application of temporalis muscle flap in the salvage nasopharyngectomy for advanced recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma].

Abstract: Objective: To summarize the application of temporalis muscle flap in the salvage nasopharyngectomy for advanced recurrent nasopharyngeal carcinoma (rNPC), and to provide guidance for the repair of extensive skull base defects in salvage rNPC. Methods: A total of 54 patients with the application of temporalis muscle flap in the salvage nasopharyngectomy for advanced rNPC were retrospectively analyzed, including 42 males and 12 females, aging from 29 to 71 years. There were 36 patients with rT3 and 18 patients with rT4. The surgical methods of temporalis muscle flap repair were summarized. The general situation, survival time and postoperative complications of patients were recorded, and the advantages and disadvantages of temporalis muscle flap were discussed. Results: The temporal muscle flap could completely cover the defect area of nasopharynx and skull base, without the need for other autologous repair materials. The follow-up period was 2 to 28 months. The survival rate of temporalis flap was 98.1% (53/54). The 1-year overall survival rate was 84.5% while 1-year progression-free survival rate was 49.0%. None of the patients had facial nerve injury. Three patients (5.6%) had necrosis of the cranial membrane required surgical intervention and four patients (7.4%) required a chonoplasty due to severe chonostril stenosis or chonostril atresia. Eleven cases (20.4%) had mouth opening restriction, chewing weakness, dysphagia and other eating difficulties. Conclusions: Temporalis muscle flap is an alternative flap for the salvage nasopharyngectomy for advanced rNPC. Temporal muscle flap shows high survival rate and wide coverage, but the surgeon should apprehend the possible complications and reduce the occurrence of them.
