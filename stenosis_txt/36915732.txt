Title: Clinical application of fiberoptic bronchoscope combined with visual laryngeal mask awake tracheal intubation technique: a case report.

Abstract: We presented a case of successful awake endotracheal intubation in a patient with a giant goiter and severe tracheal stenosis. The patient had difficulty in airway management during the perioperative anesthesia due to tracheal deviation and stenosis caused by tumor compression. We applied a visual laryngeal mask combined with fiberoptic bronchoscope to visualize the whole procedure of endotracheal intubation, from visually assessing the glottic, subglottic, and the tracheal conditions, to evaluating the pressure of the tumor on the trachea and the maximum tracheal tube diameter that could be passed. During the entire process, the patient remained awake, maintained spontaneous breathing, and actively cooperated with the clinical staff. Hence, we demonstrated that this method is safe, effective, operable, and could be generalized as a form of endotracheal intubation for patients with known difficult airways.
