Title: Frequency of post-treatment disease after excisional procedure in stage IA1 squamous cervical carcinoma - a case series.

Abstract: Early stages of cervical cancer in young women need conservative treatments. Electrosurgical therapies (LLETZ, LEEP, SWETZ, NETZ) have been recommended for these women. However, there are recommendations to perform a second excision when the specimen margins are not free of disease. This can lead to some important complications. This article aims to verify the frequency of residual invasive or microinvasive disease after the excisional procedure in women with IA1CC. Data on women with IA1CC diagnosed between 1990 and 2022, were retrieved from medical records. Post-treatment disease was detected during a second surgical procedure or postoperative follow-up. Among the 69 included women, three (4.3 percent; CI95 percent 0-9.2) had residual microinvasive lesions, while none showed invasive disease during a second procedure or follow-up. Only the age of 37â€‰years or more was significantly related to the presence of preinvasive or microinvasive residual lesions. Nearly 80 percent of the women who underwent a second procedure showed no residual lesions. The absence of invasive disease in a second procedure or during the follow-up of these women and the large proportion of women with no residual lesion questions the need for a new surgical procedure even when the surgical margins of the initial specimen are involved.
