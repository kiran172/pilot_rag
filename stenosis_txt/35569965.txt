Title: Efficacy and Safety of Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion in Mild Mitral Stenosis Patients with High Bleeding Risk.

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is highly prevalent in patients with mitral stenosis (MS), but the efficacy of left atrial appendage occlusion (LAAO) in these patients remains unclear.The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of LAAO in patients with MS complicated by AF at high risk of bleeding.We recruited patients from September 2015 to September 2018. We compared the 3-year outcomes of LAAO in 21 patients with AF complicated by MS and 42 sex- and age-matched patients with AF without MS.The MS group had more cases of peripheral arterial embolism (28.6% versus 2.4%, P = 0.004), more spontaneous echo contrast (47.6% versus 9.5%, P = 0.001), a larger LAA orifice diameter (P < 0.01), and a slower LAA flow (P < 0.05) than the Non-MS group. The mean size of the selected occluder device was bigger for patients with MS than for patients with Non-MS (29.2 ± 3.7 versus 26.9 ± 3.1 mm, P = 0.014). In the first 45 follow-up days, 2 (9.5%) patients with MS had device-related thrombi (DRT); one of them had transient ischemic attack 24 hours postoperatively. From 45 days to 6 months, one patient in each group had DRT. After 6 months, two patients in the Non-MS group still had residual leaks; one of them had a stroke, with a small DRT. The proportion of dual antiplatelet therapy was higher in the Non-MS group than in the MS group (33.3% versus 4.8%, P = 0.012), but this population had an increased bleeding risk.LAAO is relatively effective and safe for preventing embolic events in patients with MS complicated by AF, at high risk of bleeding.
