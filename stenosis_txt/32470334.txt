Title: Clinical Impact of Preprocedural Moderate or Severe Mitral Regurgitation on Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The influence of improved mitral regurgitation (MR) on the outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unknown. Our aim was to determine the impact of significant preprocedural MR and the improvement of MR after TAVR.
METHODS: A population of 1587 patients from the Optimized Catheter Valvular Intervention Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (OCEAN-TAVI) registry were evaluated. Preprocedural MR was mild or less in 1443 patients (90.9%) and moderate or severe in 144 patients (9.1%).
RESULTS: Moderate or severe MR was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality at 1 year (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.85; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-2.84; P = 0.005) and 2 years (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.15-2.34; P = 0.007). At 6 months after TAVR, the MR grade improved in 77.4% of the patients with moderate or severe baseline MR. Multivariate analysis showed that the absence of previous myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 8.00; 95% CI, 1.74-36.8; P = 0.008) and beta-blocker use at baseline (odds ratio, 2.71; 95% CI, 1.09-6.70; P = 0.031) were independently associated with improved MR at 6 months (vs unchanged, worsened MR, or death). Patients with improved MR had a significantly lower rate of midterm readmission for heart failure (11.6%) than those with unchanged or worsened MR (30.8%, P = 0.007).
CONCLUSIONS: Moderate or severe MR was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality 2 years after TAVR. Moderate or severe baseline MR was improved in most patients at 6 months after TAVR. Patients with unchanged or worsened MR had an increased rate of readmission for heart failure.
