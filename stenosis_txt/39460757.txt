Title: Imaging characteristics and clinical outcomes of hemodialysis vs. non-hemodialysis patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a Japanese single-center experience.

Abstract: In 2021, Japan approved transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for end-stage renal disease patients on hemodialysis (ESRD-HD). Yet, clinical/anatomical differences and outcomes between patients with and without ESRD-HD remain underexplored. This single-center study enrolled consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with the SAPIEN 3 between 2021 and 2023. Baseline characteristics and outcomes up to 1 year were compared. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) approach and Cox regression were used. Among 287 eligible patients, 59 had ESRD-HD. Patients with ESRD-HD were predominantly male (59.2% vs. 40.7%; p = 0.01), younger (78.0 [73.5-83.5] vs. 84.0 [79.8-88.0]; < 0.001), with lower body mass index (21.4 [19.6-23.3] vs. 22.9 [20.3-25.3]; p = 0.02], higher surgical risk (Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality ≧8%: 28 [47.5%] vs. 34 [14.9%]; p < 0.001), and more peripheral artery disease (25.4% vs. 4.8%; p < 0.001). Patients with ESRD-HD had a significantly higher prevalence of severely calcified femoral arteries (12.5% vs. 2.6%; p < 0.001). However, there were no differences in the computed-tomographic (CT) anatomical characteristics of the aortic valve complex (AVC), including the aortic valve calcium score (1995 [1372-3374] vs. 2195 [1380-3172]; p = 0.65) or the presence of moderate or severe left ventricular outflow tract calcification (4.3% vs. 5.2%; p > 0.99). Major vascular complications were rare, and technical (98.3% vs. 98.7%; p > 0.99) and device success (75.9% vs. 82.4%; p = 0.26) rates were high in both. At 1 year, there were no significant differences in a composite endpoint of death, stroke, major bleeding, or myocardial infarction (32.4% vs. 33.2%; HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.45-2.80; p = 0.81), nor its components after baseline adjustment.
