Title: Association between ASPECTS region of infarction and clinical outcome in non-acute large vessel occlusion ischaemic stroke after endovascular recanalisation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study retrospectively investigated whether infarction in specific Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) regions is associated with clinical outcome in patients with symptomatic non-acute internal carotid or middle cerebral artery occlusion who underwent endovascular recanalisation (ER).
METHODS: Preoperative ASPECTS and region of infarction were recorded before recanalisation. Clinical outcome was evaluated 90 days after the procedure using the modified Rankin Scale; a score>2 was defined as poor outcome. Secondary outcomes included postprocedural cerebral oedema, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) and symptomatic ICH.
RESULTS: Among the 86 patients included, 90-day outcome was poor in 30 (34.9%) and 40 experienced cerebral oedema (46.5%). Multivariate logistic regression models showed that lenticular nucleus infarction (OR 19.61-26.00, p<0.05), admission diastolic blood pressure (OR 1.07-1.08, p<0.05), preprocedural National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (OR 1.96-2.05, p<0.001) and haemorrhagic transformation (OR 14.99-18.81, p<0.05) were independent predictors of poor 90-day outcome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for lenticular nucleus infarction as a predictor of poor outcome was 0.73. M2 region infarction (OR 26.07, p<0.001) and low American Society of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology/Society of Interventional Radiology collateral circulation grade (OR 0.16, p=0.001) were independent predictors of postprocedural cerebral oedema. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for M2 region infarction as a predictor of cerebral oedema was 0.64. Region of infarction did not significantly differ between patients with and without postprocedural ICH or symptomatic ICH.
CONCLUSIONS: Lenticular nucleus and M2 region infarction were independent predictors of poor 90-day outcome and postprocedural cerebral oedema, respectively, in patients with non-acute anterior circulation large artery occlusion who underwent ER.
