Title: Midterm outcomes of isolated tricuspid valve surgery with a mini-thoracotomy and beating heart strategy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Isolated tricuspid valve (TV) operation is considered high-risk surgery; thus, early surgical referral is frequently discouraged. Our study aims to evaluate the outcomes of isolated TV surgery with a mini-thoracotomy and beating heart strategy.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 25 patients [median age, 65.0 years (Q1-Q3, 59.0-72.0 years)] who had undergone mini-thoracotomy beating heart isolated TV surgery from January 2017 to May 2021. TV repair was performed in 16 patients (64.0%), and TV replacement in 9 patients (36.0%). Among them, 18 patients (72.0%) had previous cardiac surgery, including TV replacement (n=4, 16.0%) and TV repair (n=4, 16.0%).
RESULTS: The median cardiopulmonary bypass time was 75.0 minutes (Q1-Q3, 61.0-98.0 minutes). There was 1 early mortality (4.0%) due to low cardiac output syndrome. Acute kidney injury requiring dialysis occurred in 3 patients (12.0%), and a permanent pacemaker was required in 1 patient (4.0%). The median lengths of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital were 1.0 day (Q1-Q3, 1.0-2.0) and 9.0 days (Q1-Q3, 6.0-18.0), respectively. The median follow-up duration was 30.3 months (Q1-Q3, 19.2-43.8). Freedoms from overall mortality, severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR), and significant tricuspid stenosis [i.e., trans-tricuspid pressure gradient (TTPG) â‰¥5 mmHg] at 4 years were 89.1%, 94.4%, and 83.3%, respectively. There was no TV reoperation.
CONCLUSIONS: Mini-thoracotomy beating heart strategy for isolated TV surgery showed favorable early and midterm outcomes. This strategy may be a valuable option for isolated TV operations.
