Title: Association of Tp-e/QT ratio with SYNTAX score II in patients with coronary artery disease.

Abstract: Background. The SYNTAX score II (SS) is an angiographic tool, which grades the complexity of coronary artery lesions and predicts short- and long-term events. Tp-e/QT ratio is a novel electrocardiographic marker for the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. We aimed to investigate whether there was a correlation between SS and Tp-e/QT ratio.Methods. A total of 227 consecutive patients who underwent elective coronary angiography were enrolled in this study. Patients who had a lumen diameter &gt;1.5 mm and at least % 50 diameter stenosis on coronary angiogram were determined as coronary artery disease (CAD) group, and others were identified as a control group. The SS was calculated for the CAD group, and SS ≥23 was defined as a high SS group, and SS &lt; 23 was identified as a low SS group. Electrocardiographic indices, such as Tp-e and Tp-e/QT, were measured for all patients. A multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed with variables age, interventricular septum thickness (IVS), hypertension, and Tp-e/QT. Results. Tp-e interval and Tp-e/QT ratio were higher in the CAD group compared with the control group. Tp-e, corrected Tp-e (cTP-e) and Tp-e/QT were higher in the high SS group than in the low SS group. The cTp-e and Tp-e/QT were correlated with SS score. Age, IVS and Tp-e/QT ratio were independent predictors of high SS in the logistic regression analysis. Conclusions. Tp-e/QT ratio was an independent predictor of high SS and might be used for risk stratification in CAD patients.
