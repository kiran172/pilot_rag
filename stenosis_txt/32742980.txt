Title: Balloon pulmonary angioplasty for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: State of the art.

Abstract: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a complex chronic disease in which pulmonary artery stenosis or obstruction caused by organized thrombus can lead to increased pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, ultimately triggering progressive right heart failure and death. Currently, its exact mechanism is not fully understood. Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) has immediate effects with low perioperative mortality and satisfactory prognosis in experienced expert centers for CTEPH patients with proximal lesions. Nevertheless, 37% of patients are deemed unsuitable for PEA surgery due to comorbidities and other factors, and nearly half of the operated patients have residual or recurrent pulmonary hypertension. Riociguat is the only approved drug for CTEPH, although its effect is limited. Balloon pulmonary angioplasty (BPA) is a promising alternative treatment for patients with CTEPH. After more than 30 years of development and refinements, emerging evidence has confirmed its role in patients with inoperable CTEPH or residual/recurrent pulmonary hypertension, with acceptable complications and comparable long-term prognosis to PEA. This review summarizes the pathophysiology of CTEPH, BPA history and development, therapeutic principles, indications and contraindications, interventional procedures, imaging modalities, efficacy and prognosis, complications and management, bridging and hybrid therapies, ongoing clinical trials and future prospects.
