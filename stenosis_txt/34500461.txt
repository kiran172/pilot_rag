Title: Systemic bevacizumab for refractory bleeding and transfusion-dependent anemia in Heyde syndrome.

Abstract: Heyde syndrome, the co-occurrence of aortic stenosis and bleeding gastrointestinal (GI) angiodysplasia, is managed with aortic valve replacement. However, severe bleeding and anemia can preclude safe use of the antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy required for this intervention. We present a case of the novel and successful treatment of severe, refractory bleeding and transfusion dependence with antiangiogenic therapy in a patient with Heyde syndrome. After systemic bevacizumab was initiated, the patient achieved durable hemostasis with normalization of hemoglobin and liberation from red cell transfusion and dependence on iron infusion; aspirin therapy was successfully initiated where it had previously failed. This durable hemostasis facilitated her subsequent successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Plasma vascular endothelial growth factor levels, which were monitored during therapy, paradoxically rose after bevacizumab was initiated but normalized after it was discontinued. Given the angiogenic dysregulation of Heyde syndrome, systemic bevacizumab may be an effective and safe targeted therapy for managing refractory GI bleeding, which thereby facilitates antiplatelet therapy and aortic valve replacement in these challenging cases. Additional investigation into the therapeutic role of inhibiting angiogenesis as a hemostatic modality in Heyde syndrome is warranted.
