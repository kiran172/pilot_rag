Title: Efficacy comparison between Mathieu combined urethral plate incision and onlay island flap urethroplasty for distal hypospadias in patients with urethral plate stenosis.

Abstract: The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy of Mathieu combined urethral plate incision (Mathieu-IP) versus onlay island flap urethroplasty in patients with distal hypospadias complicated by urethral stenosis. The clinical data of 70 patients with distal hypospadias complicated by urethral plate stenosis treated in the Department of Urology, Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital (Hefei, China), from May 2019 to May 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Thirty-eight patients underwent Mathieu-IP (Mathieu-IP group) and 32 underwent onlay island flap urethroplasty (Onlay group). Follow-ups at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months postoperatively assessed operative time, complications, urethral meatus morphology, and family satisfaction. The Mathieu-IP group had significantly shorter operative time (mean ± standard deviation [s.d.]: 81.58 ± 5.18 min) versus the Onlay group (mean ± s.d.: 110.75 ± 6.05 min; P < 0.05). Surgical success rates were 78.9% (Mathieu-IP group) and 75.0% (Onlay group), with no significant difference ( P > 0.05). Complications were comparable between the groups. The Mathieu-IP group resulted in a vertical slit-shaped urethral meatus in 89.5% versus 13.8% in the Onlay group ( P < 0.05). Family satisfaction with general penile appearance and skin shape showed no significant differences, but the Mathieu-IP group had higher satisfaction with meatal position ( P < 0.05). Mathieu-IP offers simplicity, safety, and shorter operative time compared to Onlay. Both the techniques effectively treat urethral plate stenosis in distal hypospadias, with reduced postoperative complications compared to tubularized incised plate urethroplasty. Mathieu-IP results in a vertical slit-shaped urethral meatus which enhances urinary stream, indicating its potential for broader adoption.
