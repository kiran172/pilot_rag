Title: Impact of directional coronary atherectomy followed by drug-coated balloon strategy to avoid the complex stenting for bifurcation lesions.

Abstract: Although the simple single stenting rather than complex double stenting is recommended on percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for bifurcation lesions, double stenting cannot always be avoided. We investigated the impact of directional coronary atherectomy (DCA), followed by drug-coated balloon (DCB) treatment to reduce the number of stents and avoid complex stenting in PCI for bifurcation lesions and short-term patency. DCA treatment without stents was attempted for 27 bifurcation lesions in 25 patients, of those, 26 bifurcation lesions in 24 patients were successfully treated and 3-month follow-up angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed. Sixteen lesions (59.3%) were related to left main trunk distal bifurcations, and 7 (25.9%) were true bifurcation lesions. Among the true bifurcation lesions, 4 lesions (57.1%) needed 1 stent, and the other 3 lesions (42.9%) needed no stents. Among the non-true bifurcation lesions, 1 lesion (5.0%) needed bailout stent and other lesions (95.0%) needed no stents. According to DCA followed by DCB treatment, the angiographic mean diameter stenosis improved from 65.5 ± 15.0% to 7.8 ± 9.8%, and the mean plaque area in intravascular ultrasound improved from 80.4 ± 10.5% to 39.0 ± 11.5%, respectively. Angiographic and OCT late lumen loss values were 0.2 ± 0.6 mm and 1.4 ± 1.9 mm, respectively. No patient had in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (MACE) and 3-month MACE. In conclusion, compared with standard provisional side branch stenting strategy, DCA followed by DCB treatment might reduce the number of stents, avoid complex stenting for major bifurcation lesions and provide good short-term outcomes.
