Title: Efficacy of drug-coated balloon angioplasty in early versus late occurring drug-eluting stent restenosis: A pooled analysis from the randomized ISAR DESIRE 3 and DESIRE 4 trials.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Whether there exist differences concerning clinical outcomes between patients presenting with early versus late DES-ISR undergoing treatment with drug-coated balloons (DCB) remains a scientific knowledge gap.
METHODS: This is a pooled analysis including patients with DES-ISR assigned to treatment with DCB in the setting of the ISAR DESIRE 3 and 4 trials. Clinical outcomes were evaluated according to time of occurrence of ISR after DES implantation, in patients presenting with early (≤12 months) versus late DES-ISR (>12 months) undergoing treatment with DCB. The primary endpoint of this analysis was major adverse cardiac event (MACE), defined as the combined incidence of death, myocardial infarction and target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 12 months after DCB treatment. Secondary endpoints included the incidence of death, myocardial infarction, TLR and target lesion thrombosis at 12 months after DCB treatment.
RESULTS: This analysis included 352 patients, 199 patients presented with early-ISR, 153 patients with late-ISR. Concerning the primary endpoint, patients with early-DES-ISR as compared those with late-DES-ISR showed significant higher risk (25.9% vs. 17.0%; p = .04). In a multivariate analysis including diabetic status, clinical presentation, previous coronary bypass graft and diameter stenosis after DCB-treatment, the adjusted hazard ratio showed significant higher risk for MACE of early-DES-ISR as compared to late-DES-ISR (HR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.8, [95% CI = 1.1-3.0], p = .02).
CONCLUSION: Clinical outcome at 12 months after treatment of DES-ISR with DCB, showed significant higher clinical event rates in patients presenting with early DES restenosis, as compared with patients presenting with late DES restenosis.
