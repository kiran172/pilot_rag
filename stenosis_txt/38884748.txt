Title: Molecular Pathways and Animal Models of Semilunar Valve and Aortic Arch Anomalies.

Abstract: The great arteries of the vertebrate carry blood from the heart to the systemic circulation and are derived from the pharyngeal arch arteries. In higher vertebrates, the pharyngeal arch arteries are a symmetrical series of blood vessels that rapidly remodel during development to become the asymmetric aortic arch arteries carrying oxygenated blood from the left ventricle via the outflow tract. At the base of the aorta, as well as the pulmonary trunk, are the semilunar valves. These valves each have three leaflets and prevent the backflow of blood into the heart. During development, the process of aortic arch and valve formation may go wrong, resulting in cardiovascular defects, and these may, at least in part, be caused by genetic mutations. In this chapter, we will review models harboring genetic mutations that result in cardiovascular defects affecting the great arteries and the semilunar valves.
