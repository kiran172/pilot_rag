Title: Vertebrae Destruction with Cauda Equina Syndrome Secondary to Spinal Gouty Arthritis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Gouty arthritis commonly affects peripheral joints and is associated with hyperuricaemia. Spinal manifestations of gouty arthritis are not common, and majority of published articles worldwide were case reports. This is a case report of spinal gouty arthritis that presented with spinal vertebrae destruction and cauda equina syndrome. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed destruction of L5/S1end plates with cystic collection mimicking infective changes. The tissue histological examination confirmed presence of urate crystal needles that displayed negative double refraction on light microscopy. Spinal gouty arthritis is part of the differential diagnoses in gouty arthritis patients.
