Title: Mitral Balloon Commissurotomy Prolonging the Outcome of Surgical Commissurotomy in a Patient With Rheumatic Heart Disease.

Abstract: Rheumatic heart disease is a serious global health issue that requires early detection and proper secondary prophylaxis. ItÂ is critical that governments play an active role in preventive campaigns and ensure access to recommended antibiotics. For symptomatic rheumatic heart disease cases, particularly those with rheumatic mitral stenosis, careful consideration of age and timing of surgical valve replacement is necessary, with a preference for noninvasive interventions when possible. Decision-making should involve a multidisciplinary heart team that assesses patient risks and valve morphology.
