Title: Arterial Switch Operation in Patients With Taussig-Bing Anomaly and Aortic Arch Obstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Arterial switch operation (ASO) in children with Taussig-Bing anomaly and associated aortic arch obstruction (AAO) is technically demanding. This study sought to determine outcomes of patients with Taussig-Bing anomaly and AAO who underwent ASO at a single institution.
METHODS: From 1983 to 2015, 844 patients underwent an ASO for biventricular repair at The Royal Children's Hospital. Twenty-eight patients (3.3%) had Taussig-Bing anomaly and AAO.
RESULTS: Of 28 patients, 21 (75%) underwent ASO and AAO repair as a single-stage procedure and 7 (25%) had arch repair before ASO. There were no early or late deaths. Follow-up after hospital discharge was available for all patients. Median follow-up was 17.5 years (interquartile range, 9.2-22.3; range, 4.0-31.5). All patients were in New York Heart Association class I at last follow-up. Freedom from reintervention was 61% (95% confidence interval, 40-76) and 56% (95% confidence interval, 36-73) at 5 and 15 years, respectively, after ASO. The most common reinterventions were repair of recurrent AAO, branch pulmonary artery stenosis, and neoaortic valve repair. Four of 28 patients (14%) required 5 reinterventions (3 reoperations and 2 catheter reintervention) for recurrent AAO at a median of 2.2 years after ASO (interquartile range, 2.1-2.3).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with Taussig-Bing anomaly and AAO can undergo ASO with excellent survival. Reintervention is equally common for both left- and right-sided obstruction.
