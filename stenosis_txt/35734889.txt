Title: Steroid-eluting Stent Placement for Refractory Stenosis of Parotid Megaduct After Sialodochoplasty.

Abstract: Salivary megaduct with stricture is characterized by recurrent pain, swelling, and infection, leading to reduced quality of life. Surgical management includes sialodochoplasty, however, recurrence is common and repeated surgery can lead to further scarring. In the sinuses, drug-eluting stents (DES) are used to reduce scarring after surgery, yet no such technology exists for salivary megaduct with stricture.We trialed DES for this condition with promising results which may pave the way for future development.
