Title: Endoscopic Aortic Valve Replacement: Initial Outcomes of Isolated and Concomitant Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The applicability of totally endoscopic surgical aortic valve replacement (AVR) in multivalve operations is unknown. This study describes an approach and perioperative outcomes of totally endoscopic isolated and concomitant AVR using various valve types.
METHODS: A total of 216 patients (114 male; mean age, 71.3 Â± 11.3 years) underwent totally endoscopic AVR from May 2017 to October 2022 in a tertiary care center. The 3-port technique was used: a 3- to 4-cm main port without rib spreading, a 10-mm 3-dimensional endoscopic port, and a 5-mm left-hand port with femoral cannulations. Sutures were hand tied with a knot pusher. Descriptive analyses compared perioperative outcomes between patients with or without concomitant procedures.
RESULTS: Of 216 patients, concomitant surgery was performed in 33 (15.2%) patients. Of the 33, 21 (63.6%) had a concomitant mitral procedure. A stented bioprosthesis was implanted in 165 (76.3%) patients, a mechanical valve in 22 (10.2%) patients, and a rapid deployment or sutureless valve in 29 (13.4%) patients. Median operation time and aortic cross-clamp time were 175 minutes (interquartile range; 150-194 minutes) and 78 minutes (interquartile range; 67-92 minutes) for isolated AVR, respectively. Thirty-day mortality occurred in 1 patient (0.5%). Two patients (0.9%) had conversion to sternotomy. Major neurologic events occurred in 3 patients (1.4%). The major adverse event rate was similar between patients with or without concomitant procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic AVR can safely address concomitant valve diseases.
