Title: Wide-based oblique anastomosis reduces urethral stricture rate following the transverse preputial island flap procedure.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The transverse preputial island flap (TPIF) procedure remains one of the classic single-stage procedures for severe hypospadias repairs. The incidence of postoperative complications remained high. This study aims to describe a modified urethral anastomosis technique during the TPIF procedure for severe hypospadias repairs and report its outcomes.
METHODS: Data were collected retrospectively from consecutive patients who underwent the TPIF procedure by the same pediatric urologist between January 2018 and June 2023. Collected information included age at surgery, operative details, and outcomes at follow-up. Wide-based oblique anastomosis (WOA) technique was used as a modified urethral anastomosis in all cases. In brief, the dorsal edge of anastomosis was breadthwise anchored to the corpus cavernosum with 4-5 stitches, forming a spade-shaped anastomotic surface.
RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were included in the study. The location of the corpus spongiosum division was penile in 27 patients (37.5%) and proximal in 45 patients (62.5%). The median glans width was 13 mm (range, 6-30 mm). The median ventral curvature after degloving was 45° (range, 30-150°). At a median follow-up of 4.1 years, complications occurred in 15 patients (20.8%), including nine cases of fistula, seven cases of urethral diverticulum and two cases of meatal stenosis. No cases of urethral stricture (US), urethral dehiscence, or ventral curvature occurred. Subsequent reoperations for diverticulum repairs showed that the dorsal side of the anastomosis was extensively fixed to the corpus cavernosum, forming a wide-based, spacious lumen.
CONCLUSIONS: WOA technique is straightforward and effective, especially in the prevention of postoperative US.
