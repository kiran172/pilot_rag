Title: Modified Collard technique is more effective than circular stapled for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis in prevention of anastomotic stricture: a propensity score-matched study.

Abstract: The anastomotic technique after esophagectomy is of great interest in the prevention of anastomotic complications that adversely affect postoperative recovery. This study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of modified Collard (MC) and circular stapled (CS) anastomoses after esophagectomy. A total of 504 consecutive patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who underwent esophagectomy and cervical esophagogastric CS or MC anastomosis from January 2013 to December 2019 were enrolled. Out of 504 patients, 134 and 370 underwent CS and MC anastomoses. The frequency of anastomotic leakage and stricture was significantly lesser in the MC group than in the CS group (3.0 vs. 10.5%, P = 0.0014 and 11.1 vs. 34.3%, P < 0.001, respectively). CS anastomosis was an independent risk factor for anastomotic stricture (odds ratio, 4.89; P < 0.001). Oral intake was significantly higher in the group without anastomotic stricture than in the group with anastomotic stricture at 2, 3, and 6 months postoperatively (P < 0.001, P = 0.013, and P < 0.001, respectively). The percentage body weight loss (%BWL) was -12.2% in the group with anastomotic stricture and -7.5% in the group without anastomotic stricture at 3 months postoperatively (P = 0.0012). Anastomotic stricture was an independent factor associated with %BWL (odds ratio, 4.86; P = 0.010). Propensity score-matched analysis, which included 88 pairs of patients, confirmed a significantly lower anastomotic stricture rate in the MC group than in the CS group (10.2 vs. 35.2%, P < 0.001). MC anastomosis is better than CS anastomosis for reducing the frequency of anastomotic stricture, which may be useful for maintaining early postoperative nutritional status.
