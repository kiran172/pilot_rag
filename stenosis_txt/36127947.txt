Title: Clinico-pathological characteristics of eosinophilic esophagitis in Jordanian children.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder manifested by symptoms of impaired esophageal function and hypereosinophilic esophageal inflammation. It is believed that the number of patients being diagnosed globally is increasing.
AIM: To describe the frequency and clinicopathological features of EoE in Jordanian children.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective review of all paediatric patients with eosinophilic esophagitis diagnosed and followed up at our paediatric gastroenterology service at King Abdullah University Hospital between January 2015 and January 2020.
RESULTS: During the study period, 21 patients were diagnosed with EoE out of 700 diagnostic endoscopic procedures. Only 1 (4.8%) female was diagnosed. The average age at presentation was 9.5 years (age range: 1-16 years). The most common manifestation was solid food dysphagia (15, 71.4%), followed by food impaction and vomiting (11, 52.4% and 6, 28.6%, respectively). Atopy was diagnosed in 10 (47.6%) patients. Four (19.0%) had food allergy, 3 (14.3%) had respiratory allergy, and 3 (14.3%) had combined. Linear furrows and circular rings were the most common endoscopic features - 17 (81.0%) and 10 (47.6%), respectively, while papillary elongation, basal zone hyperplasia, and eosinophilic infiltrate were the most common reported histopathological features. Almost all patients received proton pump inhibitors (19, 90.5%). Steroids were used in 18 (85.7%) patients; local steroids in 11 (52.4%), and oral steroids in 7 (33.3%). Out of the 4 (19%) patients with esophageal strictures, 2 (9.5%) required pneumatic dilatation.
CONCLUSIONS: Eosinophilic esophagitis is not uncommon in our community. Clinical and histological parameters point to delayed referral and diagnosis. Increasing awareness of this problem will lead to early diagnosis and will decrease complications.
