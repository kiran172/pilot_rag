Title: Leukocyte and Platelet Related Inflammatory Indicators and Risk of Carotid and Femoral Plaques: A Population-Based Cross-Sectional Study in Southeast China.

Abstract: The associations between several blood inflammatory indicators and risk of vascular plaques remain inconclusive. A total of 4596 native rural residents in Southeast China were enrolled from the Fuqing cohort study. Blood cell counts and their composite indexes including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and 2 novel indicators (systemic immune inflammation index (SII) and systemic immune inflammation response index (SIRI)) were considered as inflammatory indicators. Common carotid and femoral intima-media thickness (IMT) and plaques were assessed using B-mode ultrasound. Unconditional or multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate potential associations. The prevalence of multiple femoral plaques (defined as IMT ≥1.5 mm) was significantly higher among participants with the highest tertile of total leukocyte count (odds ratio, 1.78), neutrophil count (1.88), monocyte count (2.51), platelet count (1.68), NLR (1.93), PLR (1.57), SII (2.10), and SIRI (2.94). Higher levels of neutrophil count, platelet count, NLR, and SII were also found to have significant linear dose-response relationships with the prevalence of stenosis, especially in femoral arteries. In conclusion, several blood inflammatory biomarkers may contribute to, or are associated with, the presence of IMT ≥1.5 mm or stenosis especially in femoral arteries.
