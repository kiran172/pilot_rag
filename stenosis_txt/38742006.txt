Title: Thrombectomy and stenting of pseudoaneurysm from transcarotid artery revascularization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) is becoming an increasingly popular treatment of carotid stenosis. Despite this rapid adoption, little in the literature describes the associated complications of this procedure.
CASE DESCRIPTION: We report a case of a left M1 large-vessel occlusion following treatment of symptomatic, high-grade carotid stenosis with a TCAR procedure approximately three weeks earlier. The initial angiography demonstrated a pseudoaneurysm in the left common carotid artery at the site of TCAR access with a distal clot in the carotid stent. The clot within the stent was aspirated, and a mechanical thrombectomy was performed with a combination of a stent-retriever and aspiration catheter for thrombolysis in cerebral infarction 2B revascularization.
CONCLUSION: The TCAR procedure offers a novel method for revascularization of carotid lesions; it does include its complications. While generally safe, access site complications such as pseudoaneurysms can always occur. Knowledge of this risk allows for appropriate surveillance and management should it occur.
