Title: Tetralogy of Fallot with subaortic membrane: A rare association.

Abstract: Tetralogy of Fallot is the most common cyanotic disease sharing a common anatomic basis but with varied presentation.There are very few described cases of TOF with left sided obstructive lesions. We describe a left ventricular outflow tract obstruction in a 3Â year old child in association with TOF. Also we review the available literature for the association of left ventricular obstructive lesions in association with the same.
