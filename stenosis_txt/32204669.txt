Title: Pilot Study to Assess the Use of Ultrasound in Evaluating the Abnormal Pediatric Airway.

Abstract: In this study, we sought to explore the feasibility of using ultrasonography to evaluate airway anomalies in awake children with previous airway reconstruction. For the month of December 2018, we reviewed the medical records of patients aged <18 years old with prior airway reconstruction who had an outpatient appointment and a microlaryngoscopy and bronchoscopy within 24 hours of each other. Four patients met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. Sonographic airway images and measurements were obtained during the outpatient appointment and compared with those obtained during endoscopy. Ultrasound identified extraluminal stents and glottic, subglottic, and tracheal pathology. Subglottic measurements obtained sonographically were within 0.1 to 0.5 mm of the outer diameter of the appropriate endotracheal tubes. Ultrasound did not visualize tracheotomy tubes or posterolateral pathology. Our findings lay the foundation for expanding the role of ultrasound in pediatric airway assessment, keeping in mind its apparent inability to visualize posterolateral airway pathology.
