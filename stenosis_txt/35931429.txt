Title: Common Flaps in Genitourinary Reconstruction.

Abstract: Urethroplasty has evolved over time. The twentieth century saw management of urethral strictures and hypospadias with flaps. Things changed in the late 1990s with reintroduction of grafts. Buccal mucosa grafts gained popularity. There are failed urethroplasties and obliterative strictures, mostly iatrogenic, after urologic endosurgery. Such strictures need vascularized augmentation or substitution with flaps. Reconstructive urologists should be well versed in management of all types of complex cases. This article discusses the commonly used flaps in genitourinary reconstruction. Penile flaps are the commonest. Overall, the winner is the dartos. All penile flaps are based on the excellent vascularity of dartos.
