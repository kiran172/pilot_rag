Title: Simultaneous assessment of microcalcifications and morphological criteria of vulnerability in carotid artery plaque using hybrid 18F-NaF PET/MRI.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested the role of microcalcifications in plaque vulnerability. This exploratory study sought to assess the potential of hybrid positron-emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using 18F-sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) to check simultaneously 18F-NaF uptake, a marker of microcalcifications, and morphological criteria of vulnerability.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We included 12 patients with either recently symptomatic or asymptomatic carotid stenosis. All patients underwent 18F-NaF PET/MRI. 18F-NaF target-to-background ratio (TBR) was measured in culprit and nonculprit (including contralateral plaques of symptomatic patients) plaques as well as in other arterial walls. Morphological criteria of vulnerability were assessed on MRI. Mineral metabolism markers were also collected. 18F-NaF uptake was higher in culprit compared to nonculprit plaques (median TBR 2.6 [2.2-2.8] vs 1.7 [1.3-2.2]; P = 0.03) but was not associated with morphological criteria of vulnerability on MRI. We found a positive correlation between 18F-NaF uptake and calcium plaque volume and ratio but not with circulating tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) activity and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) levels. 18F-NaF uptake in the other arterial walls did not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: 18F-NaF PET/MRI may be a promising tool for providing additional insights into the plaque vulnerability.
