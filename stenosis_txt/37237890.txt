Title: Global Oxidative Status Is Linked to Calcific Aortic Stenosis: The Differences Due to Diabetes Mellitus and the Effects of Metformin.

Abstract: Calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) are related and often concomitant pathologies, accompanied by common comorbidities such as hypertension or dyslipidemia. Oxidative stress is one of the mechanisms that trigger CAS, and it can drive the vascular complications in T2DM. Metformin can inhibit oxidative stress, yet its effects have not been studied in the context of CAS. Here, we assessed the global oxidative status in plasma from patients with CAS, both alone and with T2DM (and under treatment with metformin), using multimarker scores of systemic oxidative damage (OxyScore) and antioxidant defense (AntioxyScore). The OxyScore was determined by measuring carbonyls, oxidized LDL (oxLDL), 8-hydroxy-20-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and xanthine oxidase (XOD) activity. In contrast, the AntioxyScore was determined through the catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, as well as the total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Patients with CAS displayed enhanced oxidative stress compared to control subjects, probably exceeding their antioxidant capacity. Interestingly, patients with CAS and T2DM displayed less oxidative stress, possibly due to the benefits of their pharmacological therapy (metformin). Thus, reducing oxidative stress or enhancing antioxidant capacity through specific therapies could be a good strategy to manage CAS, focusing on personalized medicine.
