Title: Transcatheter Cardiac Interventions in the Newborn: JACC Focus Seminar.

Abstract: For neonates with critical congenital heart disease requiring intervention, transcatheter approaches for many conditions have been established over the past decades. These interventions may serve to stabilize or palliate to surgical next steps or effectively primarily treat the condition. Many transcatheter interventions have evidence-based records of effectiveness and safety, which have led to widespread acceptance as first-line therapies. Other techniques continue to innovatively push the envelope and challenge the optimal strategies for high-risk neonates with right ventricular outflow tract obstruction or ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow. In this review, the most commonly performed neonatal transcatheter interventions will be described to illustrate the current state of the field and highlight areas of future opportunity.
