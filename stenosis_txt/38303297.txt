Title: [A Case of Submucosal Invasion(SM2)Gastric Cancer with Peritoneal Dissemination Three Years after Surgery].

Abstract: The patient is a 90-year-old man. Three years and 3 months after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy for early gastric cancer, pT1b(SM2)pN1M0, Stage â… , the patient visited our hospital with abdominal pain, and a large amount of ascites and stenosis of transverse colon were pointed out. He underwent a right hemicolectomy under laparotomy. Histopathologically, it was diagnosed as peritoneal recurrence of previous gastric cancer. Postoperatively, he died of aspiration pneumonia. As for the cause of death after surgery of early gastric cancer, there are many causes of death from other diseases and few from primary malignancy. Furthermore, recurrence of peritoneal dissemination is extremely rare and considered to be a valuable case.
