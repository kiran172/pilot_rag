Title: Steroid injection and polyglycolic acid shielding to prevent stricture after esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection: a retrospective comparative analysis (with video).

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Postoperative stricture after expansive esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a severe adverse event. Previous single-arm reports have suggested that polyglycolic acid (PGA) shielding may prevent stricture. This study was performed to assess the efficacy of this method through a comparative analysis.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of 500 consecutive cases of esophageal ESD performed between 2002 and 2018 at the University of Tokyo Hospital. After 2013, patients with a diagnosis of superficial esophageal carcinoma covering more than half of the esophageal circumference underwent preventive treatment with either PGA shielding or steroid injection + PGA shielding after ESD. The efficacy of these methods for preventing post-ESD stricture was assessed through multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: The risk of postoperative stricture was especially high in the cervical esophagus (odds ratio [OR], 4.60; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65-61.09) and after total circumferential resection (OR, 3.58×103; lower bound of 95% CI, &gt;185). Steroid injection + PGA shielding was the only method significantly effective in preventing stricture (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.78; P = .009). In the relatively low-risk subgroup (excluding cervical esophageal cancer and complete circumferential resection), the postoperative stricture rates for steroid injection + PGA shielding versus PGA shielding versus control were 18.9% versus 41.4% versus 51.7%, respectively (P = .015). However, the efficacy of this was limited in extremely high-risk cases.
CONCLUSION: The combination of steroid injection and PGA shielding is effective for preventing post-ESD stricture. There is a need for even more effective methods for cervical esophageal cancer and complete circumferential resection.
