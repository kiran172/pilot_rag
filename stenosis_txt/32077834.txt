Title: Stroke Following Successful PTMC in a Patient with Severe Mitral Stenosis: A Case Report and Presenting A Simple Stepwise Approach to PTMC-related Stroke.

Abstract: Stroke following percutaneous trans-septal mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) is an unusual complication that could significantly affect the quality of life of the patients, particularly the young and active ones. We present a middle-aged woman who experienced stroke following PTMC and successfully treated with thrombolytic therapy regarding the potential adverse effects of this type of therapy. Also, we present a simple novel stepwise clinical approach for PTMC-related stroke.
