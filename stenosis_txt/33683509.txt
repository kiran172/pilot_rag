Title: How to deal with low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis and reduced left ventricle ejection fraction: from literature review to tips for clinical practice.

Abstract: Low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis (LFLG AS) with reduced left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) is still a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The aim of this paper is to review the latest evidences about the assessment of the valvular disease, usually difficult because of the low-flow status, and the therapeutic options. Special emphasis is given to the available diagnostic tools for the characterization of LFLG AS without functional reserve at stress echocardiography and to the factors that clinicians should evaluate to choose between surgical aortic valve repair, transcatheter aortic valve implantation, or medical therapy.
