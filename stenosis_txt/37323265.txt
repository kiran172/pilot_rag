Title: Endoscopic drainage with a metallic stent for obstructive jaundice caused by bile duct metastasis of breast cancer: A case report.

Abstract: KEY CLINICAL MESSAGE: Bile duct metastasis of breast cancer is rare. It often causes obstructive jaundice which makes the patient interrupt state of treatment. Endoscopic drainage for obstructive jaundice is effective and less invasive treatment option also in this case.
ABSTRACT: A 66-year-old breast ductal carcinoma patient developed obstructive jaundice, presenting with epigastric discomfort and dark-colored urine. Computed tomography and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography revealed bile duct stenosis. Brushing cytology and tissue biopsy confirmed bile duct metastasis, a self-expandable metallic stent was placed/replaced endoscopically, and chemotherapy was continued, extending the patient's life.
