Title: Does diabetes mellitus affect the parotid ductal system? A sialendoscopic evaluation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the existence of ductal changes in diabetics using sialendoscopy.
STUDY DESIGN: Twenty patients and 10 volunteers received bilateral parotid diagnostic sialendoscopy. Group I included 10 patients with uncontrolled diabetes (UCD); group II, 10 patients with controlled diabetes (CD); and group III, 10 nondiabetic controls (CG). Expected ductal changes were examined in 3 proposed distinct zones. A Ï‡2 test was used to compare groups.
RESULTS: Ductal pathologic conditions were significantly higher in diabetic patients in all zones. Abnormalities were classified as stenosis, hyperemia, or others. In UCD, stenosis percentage was 55%, 90%, and 100% in zones 1, 2, and 3, respectively, compared with 30%, 40%, and 55% in CD and 5%, 5%, and 0% in CG (P < .01). Hyperemic changes in UCD were 90%, 90%, and 40% compared with 50%, 50%, and 20% in CD (P < .01) and 0% in CG. Comparing zones in UCD and CD indicated that stenosis increased significantly toward the proximal end, whereas hyperemia prevailed toward the distal end.
CONCLUSIONS: Significant ductal abnormalities were detected in the parotids of UCD and CD patients compared with CG. Ductal changes were higher in UCD compared with CD.
