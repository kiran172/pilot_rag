Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation with and without mitral stenosis - A National Readmission Database study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Mitral valve stenosis (MS) can be concomitantly present in patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI). Some studies have reported up to one-fifth of patients who underwent TAVI also have MS. The relationship between mitral stenosis and TAVI has led to concerns regarding increased adverse cardiac outcomes during and after the procedure.
METHODS: The Nationwide Readmission Database (NRD 2016-2019) was utilized to identify TAVI patients with MS with ICD-10-CM codes. The primary outcome was a 30-day readmission rate. Secondary outcomes included predictors of all-cause readmissions, length of stay, and total hospitalization cost. We assessed readmission frequency with a national sample weighed at 30 days following the index TAVI procedure. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were analyzed for in-hospital outcomes using univariate and multivariate logistic regression for study cohorts.
RESULTS: A total of 217,147 patients underwent TAVI procedures during the queried time period of the study. Of these patients, 2140 (0.98 %) had MS. The overall 30-day all-cause readmission rate for the study cohort was 12.4 %. TAVI patients with MS had higher rates of 30-day readmissions (15.8 % vs 12.3 %, aOR 1.22, CI: 1.03-1.45, P < 0.01). Additionally, TAVI patients with MS had longer lengths of hospital stay during index admissions (5.7 vs. 4.3 days), along with higher total hospitalization costs ($55,157 vs. $50,239). In contrast, in-hospital mortality during index TAVI admission did not differ significantly between the two groups, although there was a trend toward higher mortality in the MS group (2.1 % vs. 1.5 %). Among the TAVI MS cohort, patients admitted on weekends (aOR: 1.11, 95 % CI: 1.02-1.22, P = 0.01), admitted to non-metropolitan hospitals (aOR: 1.29, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.66, P = 0.04) and presence of co-morbidities such as atrial fibrillation (AF)/flutter (aOR: 1.24, 95 % CI: 1.16-1.32, P < 0.01), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (aOR: 1.16, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.22, P < 0.01), prior stroke (aOR: 1.09, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.14, P < 0.01), chronic kidney disease (CKD) ≥3 (aOR: 1.16, 95 % CI: 1.11-1.22, P < 0.01), end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (aOR: 1.75, 95 % CI: 1.61-1.90, P < 0.01), and anemia (aOR: 1.23, 95 % CI: 1.18-1.28, P < 0.01) were associated with increased odds of readmission.
CONCLUSION: Concomitant MS in patients undergoing TAVI is associated with higher readmission rates and total hospital costs. This can contribute significantly to healthcare-related burdens. Further studies are required to evaluate in-hospital outcomes and predictors of readmission in patients undergoing TAVI with the presence of concomitant MS.
