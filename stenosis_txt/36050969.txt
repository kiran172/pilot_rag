Title: Collapse of Najuta endograft (aortic arch graft) in patient with intermittent paraparesis.

Abstract: A 50-year-old male underwent thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for distal arch traumatic aortic dissection. Following placement of a Najuta endograft (Kawasumi Laboratories, Inc., Tokyo, Japan) from zone 0 to zone 4, patency of the three vessels was confirmed. Later, the patient suddenly experienced complete intermittent loss of motor and sensory functions in the bilateral lower extremities. Contrast computed tomography (CT) findings indicated endograft stenosis. Following an additional TEVAR procedure, the paraparesis state was temporarily improved. Thereafter, he was readmitted due to congestive heart failure with intermittent paraparesis and contrast CT findings indicated endograft collapse. An emergency procedure for re-expansion of the collapsed endograft and urgent surgery for replacement of the aortic arch was successful. In cases with intermittent paraparesis, endograft collapse should be considered.
