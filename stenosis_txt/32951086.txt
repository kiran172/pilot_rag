Title: Pre-procedural pacing bias among transcatheter aortic valves with higher post-procedure pacing rates: evidence from the UK TAVI Registry.

Abstract: Rates of permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are higher than following surgery and are dependent on patient factors and valve type. There is an increasing trend towards pre-emptive PPM insertion in patients with significant conduction disease prior to TAVI. We report results from the British Cardiovascular Intervention Society (BCIS) on pre- and post-procedural PPM implantation in the TAVI population. All centres in the United Kingdom performing TAVI are required to submit data on all TAVI procedures to the National database which are then reported annually. During 2015, there were 2373 TAVI procedures in the UK. 22.4% of TAVI patients had a PPM implanted either pre-procedure (including the distant past), or during the in-hospital procedural episode. Of these, 7.9% were pre-procedure and 14.5% post-procedure. Overall PPM rates were Edwards Sapien (13.5%), Medtronic CoreValve (28.2%) and Boston Lotus (42.1%; p < 0.01). Pre-procedure pacing rates were Edwards Sapien (6.0%), Medtronic CoreValve (9.1%) and Boston Lotus (12.3%; p < 0.01). Pre-procedural pacing rates for the Boston Lotus valve have risen year-on-year from 5.8% (2013) to 8.6% (2014) to 12.3% (2015). The UK TAVI Registry demonstrates a pre-procedural permanent pacing bias amongst patients receiving transcatheter valves with higher post-procedure pacing rates. Pre-emptive permanent pacing is likely to be responsible for this difference.
