Title: [Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound as a Diagnostic Tool in Diseases of the Digestive Tract].

Abstract: Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound as a Diagnostic Tool in Diseases of the Digestive Tract Abstract. Contrast-enhanced ultrasound is a good diagnostic tool in certain gastrointestinal diseases. Inflammation of the gastric and the bowel wall can often be distinguished from neoplastic alterations. Gastric and duodenal stenosis can be depicted with the use of oral contrast, and after stenting the patency can be documented. Abscesses are perfectly delineated, and after drainage the exact location of the tube and possible complications can be documented. In patients with Crohn's disease inflammatory activity and complications such as abscesses, fistulas and stenotic areas can be depicted. Distinction of fibrotic from inflammatory stenosis may help to look for surgical intervention in due time. Acute ischemic colitis has a typical perfusion pattern, and a control after a few days may show an increased vascularity.
