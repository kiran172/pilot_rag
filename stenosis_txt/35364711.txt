Title: Computed tomography predictors of structural valve degeneration in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation with balloon-expandable prostheses.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Computed tomography (CT) provides excellent anatomy assessment of the aortic annulus (AoA) and is utilized for pre-procedural planning of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We sought to investigate if geometrical characteristics of the AoA determined by CT may represent predictors of structural valve degeneration (SVD) in patients undergoing TAVI with balloon-expandable valves.
METHODS: This is a retrospective study on 124 consecutive patients (mean age: 79 ± 7 years; female: 61%) undergoing balloon-expandable TAVI prospectively enrolled in a registry. AoA maximum diameter (D<sub>max</sub>), minimum diameter (D<sub>min</sub>), and area were assessed using pre-procedural CT. SVD was identified during follow-up with transthoracic echocardiography documenting structural prosthetic valve abnormalities with or without hemodynamic changes.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up was 5.9 ± 1.7 years. SVD was found in 48 out of 124 patients (38%). AoA D<sub>max</sub>, D<sub>min</sub>, and area were significantly smaller in patients with SVD compared to patients without SVD (25.6 ± 2.2 mm vs. 27.1 ± 2.8 mm, p = 0.012; 20.5 ± 2.1 mm vs. 21.8 ± 2.1 mm, p = 0.001 and 419 ± 77 mm2 vs. 467 ± 88 mm2, p = 0.002, respectively). At univariable analysis, female sex, BSA, 23-mm prosthetic valve size, D<sub>max</sub> &lt; 27.1 mm, and a D<sub>min</sub> &lt; 19.9 mm were associated with SVD, whereas at multivariable analysis, only D<sub>min</sub> &lt; 19.9 mm (OR = 2.873, 95% CI: 1.191-6.929, p = 0.019) and female sex (OR = 2.659, 95% CI: 1.095-6.458, p = 0.031) were independent predictors of SVD.
CONCLUSIONS: Female sex and AoA D<sub>min</sub> &lt; 19.9 mm are associated with SVD in patients undergoing TAVI with balloon-expandable valves. When implanting large prostheses in order to avoid paraprosthetic regurgitation, caution should be observed due to the risk of excessive stretching of the AoA D<sub>min,</sub> which may play a role in SVD.
KEY POINTS: • Long-term durability is a concern for transcatheter aortic valve bioprosthesis. • CT provides an excellent assessment of the aortic annulus's geometrical characteristics for prosthesis sizing before transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). • Female sex and a small minimum aortic annulus diameter measured with CT are independent predictors of structural valve degeneration in patients undergoing TAVI with balloon-expandable valves.
