Title: Relationship of Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness and Retinal Vessel Calibers with Cognitive Impairment in the Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities Population.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Cognitive impairment (CI) in older individuals has a high morbidity rate worldwide, with poor diagnostic methods and susceptible population identification. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between different retinal metrics and CI in a particular population, emphasizing polyvascular status.
METHODS: We collected information from the Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities Community Study on retinal vessel calibers, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, and cognitive function of 3,785 participants, aged 40 years or older. Logistic regression was used to analyze the relationship between retinal metrics and cognitive function. Subgroups stratified by different vascular statuses were also analyzed.
RESULTS: RNFL thickness was significantly thinner in the CI group (odds ratio: 0.973, 95% confidence interval: 0.953-0.994). In the subgroup analysis, the difference still existed in the non-intracranial arterial stenosis, non-extracranial carotid arterial stenosis, and peripheral arterial disease subgroups ( P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: A thin RNFL is associated with CI, especially in people with non-large vessel stenosis. The underlying small vessel change in RNFL and CI should be investigated in the future.
