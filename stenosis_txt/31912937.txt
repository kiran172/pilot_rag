Title: Long-term functional results after excisional haemorrhoidectomy.

Abstract: AIM: The aim of this work was to perform a long-term evaluation of a randomized trial focusing on functional aspects after excisional haemorrhoidectomy with a minimum follow-up of 9 years.
METHOD: A questionnaire-based study including patients operated on for haemorrhoids in Sweden between 1999 and 2003. A total of 225 patients were randomized to Milligan's or Ferguson's operation. Twenty-six patients had died and 151 (76%) participated after a median follow-up of 10.7 years (range 9.2-12.6 years).
RESULTS: Seventy-seven patients were in the Milligan group and 74 in the Ferguson group. Forty-eight (32%) reported recurrence. Anal bleeding was reported in 80% at baseline but in 28% at long-term follow-up (P < 0.0001). At baseline, 49% had spontaneous anal pain and 25% pain at defaecation. At follow-up, these figures were 17% and 11%. At follow-up, 19% described a sense of anal stenosis. At baseline, soiling was reported in 51% but in 20% at long-term follow-up (P < 0.001). Nineteen per cent used pads preoperatively and 6% at follow-up (P < 0.0001). Straining at defaecation was reported by 35% at baseline. At follow-up, this figure was 25% (P = 0.055).
CONCLUSION: Symptoms associated with haemorrhoids were reduced at long-term follow-up. The most common problems were perceived recurrence and a sense of anal stenosis.
