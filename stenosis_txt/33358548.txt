Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy Enabled Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation via Percutaneous Axillary Access Approach.

Abstract: Transfemoral (TF) access for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the most commonly used site, however its use may be limited by prohibitive peripheral arterial disease. Although a number of alternative access techniques have been well described, each has been shown to be associated with increased risks when compared to a TF approach. Recently, planned treatment of iliofemoral artery disease using intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) has emerged as a means of preserving TF access. Ipsilateral or contralateral femoral artery access has been routinely used to perform IVL but its use may be limited in certain conditions. Here we describe the novel technique of using percutaneous axillary artery access to perform IVL of iliofemoral artery to facilitate its use for large bore access. We present a 78-year-old high surgical risk female with severe aortic stenosis who was found to have a prior stent in the contralateral iliac artery protruding into the aorta which limited a traditional 'up and over' approach, and thus axillary artery access was used to perform IVL. This is the first case in literature to describe the use of percutaneous axillary access to perform IVL of the iliac and common femoral artery to facilitate TF TAVI. Based on our previous experience we feel this technique holds promise for a routine use when use of other access sites is limited.
