Title: An Unusual Presentation of Pyloric Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: A full-term newborn female presented with non-bilious emesis immediately after feeding and abdominal distension on day one of life with neither palpable abdominal mass nor electrolyte derangements. The baby was initially admitted to rule out gastrointestinal obstruction versus sepsis as a cause of vomiting and abdominal distension. Initial imaging studies involving an upper gastrointestinal (GI) series showed obstruction at the level of the duodenum, but it was only during surgical exploration that the diagnosis of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis was made. This case report highlights the atypical presentation of pyloric stenosis and the need to investigate cases of vomiting immediately after feeding in a newborn with ultrasonography at the least to minimize complications.
