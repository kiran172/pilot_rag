Title: Management of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Complex Aorta Anatomy: The Importance of Pre-Procedural Planning.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is the most common primary valve lesion requiring surgery or, especially for older patients, transcatheter intervention (TAVI). We showcase a successful transfemoral TAVI procedure in a very high-risk patient and an extremely tortuous S-shaped descending aorta, characterized by heavy calcifications and multiple strong resistance points. We demonstrated that transfemoral TAVI using the "buddy stiff guidewire" technique could be a feasible, simple, quick, and easy procedure able to straighten an extremely abdominal aorta tortuosity. With all techniques available and careful pre-procedural planning, and thanks to the flexibility of new generation TAVI delivery systems, it is possible to safely perform the procedure even in the most challenging patients.
