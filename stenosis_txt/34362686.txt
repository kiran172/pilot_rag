Title: Commissural Alignment With New-Generation Self-Expanding Transcatheter Heart Valves During Aortic Replacement.

Abstract: Preserving coronary artery access is a crucial goal during transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures, especially in case of self-expandable transcatheter heart valve (SE-THV) implantation. In this light, a proper commissural alignment is needed to avoid the risk of coronary obstruction and to permit easy vessels re-cannulation for diagnostic and interventional purposes. New-generation SE-THVs have been furnished of different markers, able to guide operators to perform a correct commissural alignment. In this case series, we describe key procedural aspects of commissural alignment for the different available SE-THVs, providing a step-by-step tutorial for each device. Lastly, we illustrate a commissural alignment in a contrast-zero TAVR.
