Title: Serum Biomarkers are Associated With Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease Among Patients With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Undergoing Elective Angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We assessed select cardiac biomarker associations for existing or future coronary artery disease (CAD) risk in patients with NAFLD.
METHODS: Patients with/without NAFLD undergoing elective cardiac angiography were prospectively enrolled. Severe CAD was defined as presence of at least 1 proximal artery >70% stenosis; risk of severe CAD as either existing severe CAD or atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease score ≥20; NAFLD was defined as hepatic fat in the absence of other liver diseases. Cardiac biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I [hs-cTnI]) were measured using Atellica Solution assays (Siemens Healthineers).
RESULTS: A total of 619 patients were enrolled (mean age, 63 ± 10 years; 80% male; 31% type 2 diabetes; 65% NAFLD); 42% had severe CAD, and 57% had risk of severe CAD. NAFLD prevalence was similar between patients with and without severe CAD (68% vs 62%; P > .05). Patients with NAFLD with severe CAD (44%) or with risk of severe CAD (58%) had higher levels of hs-cTnI than NAFLD controls (both P < .001). Presence of severe CAD or risk of severe CAD in all patients was associated with older age, male, aspects of metabolic syndrome, and elevated hs-cTnI: odds ratio 2.0 (95% confidence interval [CI],1.4-2.9) and 1.8 (95% CI, 1.1-3.0), respectively; 2.3 (95% CI, 1.4-3.8) and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.2-4.2), respectively, in patients with NAFLD (all P < .02).
CONCLUSION: CAD is common in patients with NAFLD. High hs-cTnI was associated with an increased risk of CAD. Pending validation, hs-cTnI may be a useful marker for CAD risk prediction in patients with NAFLD.
