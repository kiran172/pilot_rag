Title: Isolated ventricular inversion with hypoplastic right ventricle and pulmonary stenosis in an adolescent with situs solitus: a rare combination.

Abstract: Isolated ventricular inversion with situs solitus is a severe and rare congenital cardiac malformation characterised by an atrioventricular discordance but with ventriculo-arterial concordance. Here, we present the rare case of an adolescent with isolated ventricular inversion and hypoplasia of the left-sided morphological right ventricle and pulmonary stenosis, a first of its kind to be reported in the literature.
