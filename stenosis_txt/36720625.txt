Title: [Application and value of intravascular ultrasound for excimer laser ablation combined with drug-coated balloon in the treatment of lower limb arteriosclerotic obliterans].

Abstract: Objective: To examine the value of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) for excimer laser ablation (ELA) combined with drug-coated balloon (DCB) in treating lower limb arteriosclerotic obliterans (ASO). Methods: As a prospective case series study, patients who underwent ELA combined with DCB for lower limb ASO with the guidance of IVUS from September 2021 to March 2022 at Department of Vascular Surgery, Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University were enrolled prospectively. Lesion characteristics, procedure-related outcomes and complications were collected. The therapy outcomes were compared with baseline data by paired t test. Results: There were 8 males and 2 females, aged (72.0±5.9) years (range: 61 to 81 years). Of all the 11 lesions, there were 8 lesions in superficial femoral artery and 3 in popliteal artery. The lesion length was (7.0±2.4) cm (range: 3.2 to 9.8 cm). There were 4 chronic totally occlusion and 7 severe stenosis. All patients underwent the operation successfully. The technical success rate was 10/11. Bailout stenting was performed in one lesion because of flow-limiting dissection. Four lesions were grade 3 to 4 in peripheral artery calcium score system, and 9 lesions with calcification arc≥180°. Larger diameter drug-coated balloons were selected in 5 lesions after measurement of intravascular ultrasound. The follow-up time was (6.0±1.9) months (range: 3 to 9 months). The ankle-brachial index of the patient was significantly improved immediately after surgery (0.97±0.13 vs. 0.48±0.18, t=-7.60, P&lt;0.01) and at 3 months after surgery (0.95±0.12 vs. 0.48±0.18, t=-7.17, P&lt;0.01). The 3-month primary patency rate was 11/11, the target lesion reintervention was 0 and ulcer healing rate was 3/4. Conclusion: IVUS assisted ELA in the treatment of lower limb artery lesions is safe and effective in early stage.
