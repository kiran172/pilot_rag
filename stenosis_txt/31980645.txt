Title: Diagnostic performance of a vessel-length-based method to compute the instantaneous wave-free ratio in coronary arteries.

Abstract: The instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) is a recently introduced vasodilator-free index to assess the functional severity of coronary stenosis in the resting state, while fractional flow reserve (FFR) is the gold standard index in hyperemia. The computed instantaneous wave-free ratio (CT-iFR) is a noninvasive method to estimate iFR using computer simulations. Here, we developed a vessel-length-based CT-iFR method in patient-specific models of coronary arteries. This method was implemented by coupling a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics model with a lumped parameter model (LPM) of coronary circulation in a non-hyperemic resting state. A time-varying resistance in the LPM was used for the iFR simulation. In total, 50 coronary vessels of 32 patients were computed, and their CT-iFR values were compared with clinically measured iFRs to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the present CT-iFR method. The area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of CT-iFR validation was 0.93. In diagnostic performances of CT-iFR, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 86%, 83.3%, and 86.8%, respectively. These results indicate that this CT-iFR method can be used as a pre-operative aid to establish a percutaneous coronary intervention strategy as a noninvasive alternative to iFR.
