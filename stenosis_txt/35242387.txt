Title: Valvular Cardiomyopathy: The Value of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging.

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging has had a vast impact on the understanding of a wide range of disease processes and pathophysiological mechanisms. More recently, it has contributed significantly to the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with valvular heart disease. With its increasing use, CMR allows for a detailed, reproducible, qualitative, and quantitative evaluation of left ventricular volumes and mass, thereby enabling assessment of the haemodynamic impact of a valvular lesion upon the myocardium. Postprocessing of the routinely acquired images with feature tracking CMR methodology can give invaluable information about myocardial deformation and strain parameters that suggest subclinical ventricular impairment that remains undetected by conventional measures such as the ejection fraction (EF). T1 mapping and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging provide deep myocardial tissue characterisation that is changing the approach towards risk stratification of patients as an increasing body of evidence suggests that the presence of fibrosis is related to adverse events and prognosis. This review summarises the current evidence regarding the utility of CMR in the left ventricular assessment of patients with aortic stenosis or mitral regurgitation and its value in diagnosis, risk stratification, and management.
