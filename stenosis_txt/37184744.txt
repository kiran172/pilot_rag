Title: Regulatory T Cells in Pathological Cardiac Hypertrophy: Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pathological cardiac hypertrophy is linked to immune-inflammatory injury, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) play a crucial role in suppressing immune-inflammatory responses. However, the precise role of Tregs in pathological cardiac hypertrophy remains unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To summarize the current knowledge on the role and mechanisms of Tregs in pathological cardiac hypertrophy and explore their perspectives and challenges as a new therapeutic approach.
RESULTS: Treg cells may play an important protective role in pressure overload (hypertension, aortic stenosis), myocardial infarction, metabolic disorders (diabetes, obesity), acute myocarditis, cardiomyopathy (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, storage diseases), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease-related pathological cardiac hypertrophy. Although some challenges remain, the safety and efficacy of Treg-based therapies have been confirmed in some clinical trials, and engineered antigen-specific Treg cells may have better clinical application prospects due to stronger immunosuppressive function and stability.
CONCLUSION: Targeting the immune-inflammatory response via Treg-based therapies might provide a promising and novel future approach to the prevention and treatment of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.
