Title: Outcome of patients with epithelialized cavity formation after excessive vesicourethral anastomotic leak post radical prostatectomy.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Excessive vesicourethral anastomotic leak (EVAL) is a rare but severe complication after radical prostatectomy (RP). Epithelialized vesicourethral cavity formation (EVCF) usually develops during prolonged catheterization. To our knowledge, there is no description of postoperative outcomes, complications, or functional assessment of these patients who received conservative therapy after EVAL.
METHODS: We identified 70 patients (0.56%) with radiographic evidence of EVCF out of 12,434 patients who received RP in 2016-2020 at our tertiary care center. Postoperative radiographic cystograms (CG) were retrospectively re-examined by two urologists individually. We assessed urinary continence (UC), the need for intervention due to anastomotic stricture formation, urinary tract infection (UTI), and symphysitis during the first year of follow-up post-RP.
RESULTS: The median age was 66 years [interquartile range (IQR) 61-70 years], the median body mass index was 27.8 kg/m2 (IQR 25.5-30.3 kg/m2), and the median prostate specific antigen before RP was 7.1 ng/ml (IQR 4.7-11.8 ng/ml). The median catheter insertion time was 44.5 days (IQR 35.2-54 days). One-year continence follow-up was available for 27 patients (38.6%), of which 22 (81.5%) reported the use of ≤ one pad, two patients reported the use of two (7.4%) pads/24 h, and three (11.1%) patients reported use &gt; two pads/24 h. Overall, four (5.7%) patients needed surgical reintervention for anastomotic stricture, eight (11.5%) patients presented with symphysitis, and 55 (77.1%) presented with UTI.
CONCLUSION: UC in 81.5% 1-year post-RP suggests that conservative treatment in EVAL is a treatment option with an acceptable outcome on UC and should be considered before reintervention for anastomotic insufficiency.
