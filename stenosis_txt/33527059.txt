Title: Lumbar Extradural Angiolipoma: Clinical Presentation and Management.

Abstract: Angiolipomas are rare primary benign tumors that can arise in the epidural canal and cause stenosis. Of the few cases of spinal angiolipomas described, most lesions have been located in the thoracic spine, and presentation of angiolipoma in the lumbar spine is very rare. The surgical management of a 39-year-old morbidly obese woman with angiolipoma that caused stenosis with neurogenic claudication and urinary changes is described. The lesion spanned L1-L2 and surgical management consisted of T12-L2 laminectomy and en-bloc resection of the lesion. During the latest follow-up, four years after the surgery, the patient's neurological symptoms showed improvement and there was no recurrence.
