Title: Spinal Shortening Surgery for Lumbosacral Nerve Bowstring Disease: A Surgical Technique.

Abstract: Lumbosacral nerve bowstring disease (LNBD) is a syndrome of neurological symptoms caused by differences in the development speed of lumbosacral bone tissue and nerve tissue, which result in a longitudinal stretch of the slow-growing nerve tissue. LNBD is usually caused by congenital factors and accompanied by other lumbosacral diseases, such as lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar spondylolisthesis, and iatrogenic factors. The main symptoms of LNBD are lower extremity neurological symptoms and fecal dysfunction. The conservative treatment of LNBD includes rest, functional exercise, and drug therapy, but it usually fails to achieve satisfactory clinical results. Few studies have reported on the surgical treatment of LNBD. In this study, we used posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) to shorten the spine (0.6-0.8mm/segment). This reduced the axial tension of the lumbosacral nerves and relieved the patient's neurological symptoms. We report on the case of a 45 year old male patient whose main symptoms were left lower extremity pain, decreased muscle strength, and hypoesthesia. The above symptoms were significantly relieved 6 months after surgery.
