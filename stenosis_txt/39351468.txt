Title: The implications of measuring lipoprotein(a) in clinical practice.

Abstract: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) is a well-recognized causal risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) and calcific aortic valve stenosis. There are ongoing challenges with screening and management in primary and secondary prevention; however, future recommendations for clinical practice await the outcomes of clinical trials that are in progress.
