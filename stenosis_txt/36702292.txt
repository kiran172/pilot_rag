Title: Educating Surgeons to Construct Valved Conduits: What Does It Take to Achieve Reproducible Results?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Despite the demonstrated utility of surgeon-fashioned polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) valved conduits, methods for educating surgeons to reproducibly construct these conduits are lacking. We present a surgeon education process and early outcomes for children receiving surgeon-fashioned PTFE valved conduits during the initial learning curve.
METHODS: The educational curriculum included 4 hours of proctored instruction/supervised valve construction, followed by 2 hours of individual practice. A surgeon with prior mastery of the technique provided templated designs, videos, and follow-up consultation. A retrospective medical record review (2017-2022) described early outcomes and valve function for patients receiving surgeon-fashioned PTFE right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery conduits.
RESULTS: Two surgeons were educated using the method described. Fifteen valved conduits were implanted in 14 patients (median patient age, 38 months; conduit size range, 10-24 mm). At discharge, no patient had more than mild stenosis or regurgitation, and 12 of 15 valves (80%) had none or trivial regurgitation. Median follow-up was 14 months (range, 1-52 months). At the last follow-up, median peak conduit gradient of the 15 valves was low (18 mm Hg), 1 (7%) had moderate stenosis, and 1 (7%) had mild-moderate regurgitation. Two conduits were replaced concomitantly during repair of associated lesions at 14 and 38 months (sizes 10 and 12 mm, respectively). There were no deaths and no infectious complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Four hours of proctored surgeon education plus deliberate practice is an effective method for teaching valved PTFE conduit construction and is associated with excellent early valve function. This study provides educational methods and initial evidence of safety for congenital surgeons wishing to learn and adopt this technique.
