Title: Comparative Outcomes After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Unconscious and Conscious Patients With Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Up to 70% of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) patients have a relevant coronary stenosis which may need revascularization. The short- and long-term ischemic and bleeding risk of unconscious and conscious OHCA patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is largely unknown.
OBJECTIVES: This study sought to compare the occurrence of 1-year outcomes after PCI between OHCA patients, stratified on the basis of state of consciousness, with patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) not preceded by OHCA.
METHODS: The study assessed the unadjusted and adjusted risk of cardiovascular events in a prospective single-center cohort of 9,303 consecutive PCI patients.
RESULTS: At 1 year, all-cause mortality was higher in unconscious (49.5%) but not in conscious OHCA (8.9%) patients than in ACS patients (8.0%), and both unconscious and conscious OHCA patients were more likely than ACS patients to experience definite stent thrombosis (4.4% and 3.5% vs 1.3%) and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5 bleeding (17.8% and 9.0% vs 5.1%). The higher hazards were largely determined by events occurring in the first 30 days. After multivariable adjustment, only unconscious OHCA patients remained at increased risk of death (adjusted HR: 3.27; 95% CI: 2.65-4.05), definite stent thrombosis (adjusted HR: 2.40; 95% CI: 1.30-4.43), and Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5 bleeding (adjusted HR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.82-3.47) at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: At 1 year after PCI, unconscious OHCA patients were at higher risk of death, definite stent thrombosis, and bleeding, while conscious OHCA patients had similar hazards compared with an all-comer ACS population without OHCA. Dedicated PCI strategies for OHCA patients taking into account their state of consciousness after resuscitation are warranted.
