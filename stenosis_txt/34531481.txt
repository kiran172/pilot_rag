Title: Extent and characteristic of relationships in canal dimension and canal body ratio between cervical and lumbar spine.

Abstract: A known prevalence of concurrent cervical and lumbar spinal stenosis was shown to be 5-25%, but there is a lack of evidence regarding direct relationships in canal dimension and canal-body ratio between cervical and lumbar spine. Total 247 patients (mean age: 61 years, male: 135) with cervical and lumbar computed tomography scans were retrospectively reviewed. Midsagittal vertebral body and canal diameters in reconstructed images were measured at all cervical and lumbar vertebrae, and canal-body ratios were calculated. The canal diameter and ratio were also compared according to the gender and age, and correlation analysis was performed for each value. There were significant correlations between cervical (C3-C7) and lumbar (L1-L5) canal dimension (p < 0.001). C5 canal diameter was most significantly correlated with L4 canal diameter (r = 0.435, p < 0.001). Cervical canal-body ratios (C3-C7) were also correlated with those of lumbar spine (L1-L5) (p < 0.001). The canal-body ratio of C3 was most highly correlated with L3 (r = 0.477, p < 0.001). Meanwhile, mean canal-body ratios of C3 and L3 were significantly smaller in male patients than female (p = 0.038 and p < 0.001) and patient's age was inversely correlated with C5 canal diameter (r = - 0.223, p < 0.001) and C3 canal-body ratio (r = - 0.224, p < 0.001). Spinal canal dimension and canal-body ratio have moderate degrees of correlations between cervical and lumbar spine and the elderly male patients show the tendency of small canal diameter and canal-body ratio. This relationship of cervical and lumbar spine can be an important evidence to explain to the patients.
