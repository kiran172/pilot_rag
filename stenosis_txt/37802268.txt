Title: Progression of Pediatric Crohn's Disease Is Associated With Anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor Timing and Body Mass Index Z-Score Normalization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND & AIMS: The evolution of complicated pediatric Crohn's disease (CD) in the era of anti-tumor necrosis factor (aTNF) therapy continues to be described. Because CD progresses from inflammatory to stricturing (B2) and penetrating (B3) disease behaviors in a subset of patients, we aimed to understand the risk of developing complicated disease behavior or undergoing surgery in relation to aTNF timing and body mass index z-score (BMIz) normalization.
METHODS: Multicenter, 5-year longitudinal data from 1075 newly diagnosed CD patients were analyzed. Descriptive statistics, univariate and stepwise multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression (CPHR), and log-rank analyses were performed for risk of surgery and complicated disease behaviors. Differential gene expression from ileal bulk RNA sequencing was correlated with outcomes.
RESULTS: Stricturing complications had the largest increase: from 2.98% to 10.60% over 5 years. Multivariate CPHR showed aTNF exposure within 3 months from diagnosis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.33; 95% CI, 0.15-0.71) and baseline L2 disease (HR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.09-0.92) to be associated with reduced B1 to B2 progression. For children with a low BMIz at diagnosis (nÂ = 294), multivariate CPHR showed BMIz normalization within 6 months of diagnosis (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.26-0.85) and 5-aminosalicyclic acid exposure (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.13-0.81) were associated with a decreased risk for surgery while B2 (HR, 4.20; 95% CI, 1.66-10.65) and B2+B3 (HR, 8.24; 95% CI, 1.08-62.83) at diagnosis increased surgery risk. Patients without BMIz normalization were enriched for genes in cytokine production and inflammation.
CONCLUSIONS: aTNF exposure up to 3 months from diagnosis may reduce B2 progression. In addition, lack of BMIz normalization within 6 months of diagnosis is associated with increased surgery risk and a proinflammatory transcriptomic profile.
