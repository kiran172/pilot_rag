Title: The effect of bony cochlear nerve canal (BCNC) diameter on the degree of sensorineural hearing loss.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study investigated the correlation between the diameter of the bony cochlear nerve canal (BCNC), as determined by Temporal bone CT, and MRI findings of cochlear nerves (CN) in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study design was followed. Radiological data (Temporal bone CT and MRI) of fifty children with sensorineural hearing loss (age <18 y) were included in the study. All patients (100 ears) underwent routine MRI protocol in addition to 3D CISS (3-D constructive interference in steady state).
RESULTS: Based on CT findings, the BCNC was classified according to its diameter into three groups; group 1 (<1.4 mm), group 2 (1.4-2.0 mm), and group 3 (>2.0 mm). A significant difference between the three groups at degrees of SNHL (p < 0.001) was observed. Significant difference (p < 0.001) was also observed in the mean level of pure tone audiometry (PTA) average in group 1 compared to group 2. The CN was absent in 20 ears of group 1 CT results (29%), CN hypoplasia was noticed in 40 ears of group 1 CT (58%). However, CN was present in 9 ears of group 1 CT (13%), while in group 2 and 3, CN was present in 100% of the cases (27, and 4 ears, respectively, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: MRI and CT imaging are valuable in the diagnosis of SNHL in children. Moreover, with BCNC stenosis, there was a high probability of CN aplasia or hypoplasia.
