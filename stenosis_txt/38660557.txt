Title: Protocol for lower back pain management: Insights from the French healthcare system.

Abstract: In this editorial we comment on the article published in a recent issue of the World Journal of Clinical Cases. This article described a novel ultrasound-guided lateral recess block approach in treating a patient with lateral recess stenosis. The impact of spinal pain-related disability extends significantly, causing substantial human suffering and medical costs. Each county has its preferred treatment strategies for spinal pain. Here, we explore the lower back pain (LBP) treatment algorithm recommended in France. The treatment algorithm for LBP recommended by the French National Authority for Health emphasizes early patient activity and minimal medication use. It encourages the continuation of daily activities, limits excessive medication and spinal injections, and incorporates psychological assessments and non-pharmacological therapies for chronic cases. However, the algorithm may not aggressively address acute pain in the early stages, potentially delaying relief and increasing the risk of chronicity. Additionally, the recommended infiltrations primarily involve caudal epidural steroid injections, with limited consideration for other injection procedures, such as transforaminal or interlaminar epidural steroid injections. The fixed follow-up timeline may not accommodate patients who do not respond to initial treatment or experience intense pain, potentially delaying the exploration of alternative therapies. Despite these limitations, understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the French approach could inform adaptations in LBP treatment strategies globally, potentially enhancing patient outcomes and satisfaction across diverse healthcare systems.
