Title: Treatment Strategies for Basilar Top Syndrome Caused by Acute Vertebral Artery Occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We report a patient with basilar artery embolism caused by vertebral artery stenosis who was successfully treated using simultaneous percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and mechanical thrombectomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 64-year-old male, who had undergone medical treatment for cerebellum infarction at another hospital, was referred to our hospital due to disturbance of consciousness. Angiography revealed acute occlusion of the first part of the right vertebral artery and an embolism of the top of basilar artery. After performing PTA to create an approach route for the embolism, we collected it using a clot recovering device. The postoperative course was good, and the patient was discharged with mild ataxia and dysarthria.
CONCLUSION: We report the successful treatment of progressive cerebral infarction of the posterior circulation with revascularization 30 hours after symptom onset. Unlike the anterior circulation, the posterior circulation consists of smaller arteries and fewer collateral arteries, making it vulnerable to ischemic attack. Therefore, shortening the time until treatment may improve the outcome.
