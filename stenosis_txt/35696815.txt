Title: Impact of pregnancy on airway complications after intubation for COVID-19 infection: A case series.

Abstract: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is associated with severe acute respiratory illness, often requiring intensive care unit admission. Some patients require prolonged intubation and mechanical ventilation. Post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis occurs in approximately four to 13Â % of adult patients after prolonged intubation in the absence of COVID-19 infection. The rate of COVID-19 related post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis may be higher. Of 339 pregnant patients with COVID-19, we identified seven who required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Four of the seven developed persistent airway complications, and laryngotracheal stenosis, the most severe, was present in three. Each patient had variations in duration of intubation, endotracheal tube size, re-intubation, presence of superimposed infections, and pre-existing comorbidities. We speculate that underlying physiologic changes of pregnancy in addition to the increased inflammatory state caused by COVID-19 are associated with an increased risk of post-intubation laryngotracheal stenosis. Otolaryngology physicians should have a low threshold for considering this pathophysiology when consulting on obstetric patients who have previously been intubated with COVID-19. Otolaryngologists can educate obstetricians when caring for pregnant patients who have laryngotracheal stenosis, especially those who may require emergency airway management for obstetric indications.
