Title: Long-term outcomes of refractory esophageal strictures after endoscopic submucosal dissection of superficial esophageal neoplasms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Many studies have focused on prophylactic therapy for post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) of esophageal strictures. However, various strategies cannot prevent the occurrence of postoperative strictures after extensive ESD. Postoperative strictures often inevitably occur, and endoscopic dilation is still a temporarily effective therapy.
METHODS: This study included patients with post-ESD refractory esophageal strictures (RESs) from January 2014 to November 2019. Clinical effectiveness was assessed using univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. Hierarchical linear models were used to identify factors that predicted the dysphagia-free period.
RESULTS: A total of 50 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and entered the study. Twenty-seven (54%) patients had a history of prophylactic oral steroid therapy. Forty-six patients (92%) underwent ≥ 75% circumferential resection, including 32 (64%) cases involving entire circumferential ESD. The mean dysphagia-free period of 50 patients was 2.9 months (95% CI 2.3-3.5). The dysphagia-free period had a linear growth trend over time, increasing by 6.9 days per endoscopic therapy, and the estimated last dysphagia-free period was 85.9 days. Old and female patients had shorter dysphagia-free periods compared with young and male patients. Endoscopic therapy success was achieved in 30 (60%) patients. Multivariate analysis revealed that circumferential lesions (OR 6.106, 95% CI 1.013-36.785, P = 0.048) were significant predictive factors for poor clinical outcome.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic dilation seemed effective in patients with post-ESD RESs by increasing the dysphagia-free period. After approximately 10 continuous dilations, 60% of patients achieved endoscopic success, and the remission rate of obstruction was increased. Prophylactic oral steroid therapy could reduce the occurrence of RESs. However, once a RES had occurred, prophylactic steroid therapy could not reduce the frequency of dilations or change the long-term outcomes.
TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was prospectively registered and approved by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (IRB number: ChiCTR-ONN-17012382) on 2015.
