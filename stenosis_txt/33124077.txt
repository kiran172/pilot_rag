Title: Aortic root enlargement: When and how.

Abstract: Aortic valve replacement is the definitive management for severe aortic stenosis. Intraoperatively, an aortic root enlargement (ARE) may be used to facilitate the implementation of a suitably sized prosthetic valve. This is to prevent patient prosthesis mismatch (PPM), a condition that causes a left ventricular outflow obstruction. There are four main techniques that are used to perform ARE, namely, Nicks, Manouguian, Nunez (modified Manouguian), and Kanno-Rastan procedures. They each involve incisions through different anatomical structures and allow a variety of valve sizes to be implanted. Studies prove that ARE effectively reduces the incidence of PPM. In addition, they show that there is no definitive link between ARE and perioperative mortality or other complications. There is a scarcity of literature exploring the comparative outcomes of each surgical technique. Therefore, further research is warranted for these procedures to be compared adequately. This review aims to summarise the available literature surrounding ARE with respect to three main questions. (1) What are the indications for ARE, (2) what surgical techniques exist to facilitate ARE, and (3) are there significant differences in patient outcomes when these surgical techniques are employed?
