Title: Exploring Pathways for Pain Relief in Treatment and Management of Lumbar Foraminal Stenosis: A Review of the Literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) involves the narrowing of neural foramina, leading to nerve compression, significant lower back pain and radiculopathy, particularly in the aging population. Management includes physical therapy, medications and potentially invasive surgeries such as foraminotomy. Advances in diagnostic and treatment strategies are essential due to LFS's complexity and prevalence, which underscores the importance of a multidisciplinary approach in optimizing patient outcomes.
METHOD: This literature review on LFS employed a systematic methodology to gather and synthesize recent scientific data. A comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases using specific keywords related to LFS. The search, restricted to English language articles from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2023, focused on peer-reviewed articles, clinical trials and reviews. Due to the heterogeneity among the studies, data were qualitatively synthesized into themes related to diagnosis, treatment and pathophysiology.
RESULTS: This literature review on LFS analyzed 972 articles initially identified, from which 540 remained after removing duplicates. Following a rigorous screening process, 20 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. These studies primarily focused on evaluating the diagnostic accuracy, treatment efficacy and pathophysiological insights into LFS.
CONCLUSION: The comprehensive review underscores the necessity for precise diagnostic and management strategies for LFS, highlighting the role of a multidisciplinary approach and the utility of a unified classification system in enhancing patient outcomes in the face of this condition's increasing prevalence.
