Title: Helical Blood Flow in Hemodynamically Significant Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To define helical blood flow (HBF) characteristics in hemodynamically significant atherosclerotic stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) by means of duplex scanning.
METHODS: Twenty-five hemodynamically significant (65.0% [range, 63.0%-69.0%]) carotid stenoses were examined in 23 patients. The severity of the stenosis was calculated by the European Carotid Surgery Trial grading method by transverse section scanning in the B-mode. Rotational components were estimated in color flow mapping by transverse-section scanning of a vessel at the most narrowed site, as well as in the prestenotic and poststenotic segments. A quantitative evaluation of HBF was performed on the basis of pulsed wave Doppler imaging of longitudinal and transverse sections of the arterial lumen.
RESULTS: Helical blood flow was most often (68%) registered in the poststenotic segment of the ICA as a single vortex (52%) or double vortices (16%). At the most narrowed site, HBF was registered in 48% of the cases (44% single vortex and 4% double vortices), whereas in the prestenotic segment of the blood vessel, it was registered in only 16% of the cases (8% single vortex and 8% double vortices). The time-averaged maximum blood flow velocities at the most narrowed site were 88.5 cm/s (25th-75th percentiles, 73.8-127.8 cm/s) for the axial component and 33.1 cm/s (22.7-40.9 cm/s) for the rotational component. The calculated summary velocity of motion of the blood particles in helical paths was 92.2 cm/s (75.7-144.2 cm/s).
CONCLUSIONS: It has been shown that HBF can be registered by Doppler ultrasound in atherosclerotic stenosis, and its registration rate increases while passing through the narrowed segment of the ICA.
