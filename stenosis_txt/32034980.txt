Title: Late onset CMV disease presenting as a colonic stricture in a liver transplant recipient.

Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients in the first 6 months after transplant. Late onset CMV infection or disease outside the classical risk period is uncommon and can present with atypical signs and symptoms. Here, we report a case of late onset CMV presenting as a colonic stricture more than 10 years after liver transplantation in the absence of traditional CMV risk factors. We also briefly review CMV colitis presenting as a mass or stricture in SOT recipients.
