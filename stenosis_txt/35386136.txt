Title: Successful Explantation of a Ball and Cage Mitral Valve Prosthesis 48 Years After Initial Implantation.

Abstract: A 58-year-old female had undergone previous mechanical mitral replacement with a Starr-Edwards ball and cage valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) at 11 years of age for rheumatic disease. The valve functioned well until pannus resulted in prosthetic valve stenosis with class IV dyspnea and pulmonary hypertension. She underwent reoperative mitral replacement with an On-X mechanical mitral prosthesis (Cryolife, Kennesaw, GA) 48 years after initial implantation. To our knowledge, this case represents the longest known implant period of a ball and cage mitral valve in the literature. This presentation highlights the durability of this historic prosthesis, along with the role of reoperative surgery decades after initial implantation.
