Title: Sex Differences in In-Hospital Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Since the introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), there has been a paradigm shift in the management of severe aortic stenosis. While women represent almost half of the patients undergoing TAVR, there are limited data on sex-based comparisons in hospital outcomes and predictors of mortality in women and men. The National Inpatient Sample database from 2012 to 2015 was used to identify TAVR using international classification of diseases-9 clinical modification procedure codes 35.05 and 35.06. We identified 61,239 patients who underwent TAVR between 2012 and 2015. After adjusting for potential confounders, women had higher odds of all-cause mortality as compared to men [odds ratio (OR) 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01-1.54; P = 0.036]. Moreover, women had significantly increased odds of cardiac complications [OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.67-3.49; P ≤ 0.01], respiratory complications [OR 1.20 95% CI: 1.07-1.34; P = 0.001], major hemorrhage requiring transfusion [OR 1.51, 95% CI: 1.37-1.67; P ≤ 0.001], neurological complications [OR 1.38, 95% CI: 0.95-1.99; P = 0.08], need for vasopressor treatment [OR 1.33, 95% CI: 1.01-1.75; P = 0.04], and vascular complications [OR 1.73, 95% CI: 1.19-2.52; P = 0.004]. On the contrary, the odds of pacemaker requirement [OR 0.85, 95% CI: 0.75-0.97; P = 0.02], and acute kidney injury [OR 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71-0.91; P = 0.001] were significantly lower in women. Among patients undergoing TAVR, women were more likely to have in-hospital complications and mortality as compared with men. Further studies are needed to identify the discrepancy in in-hospital outcomes with sex-specific factors being considered.
