Title: Transverse-Sigmoid Sinus Dural Arteriovenous Fistula Concurrent With Bilateral Venous Sinus Occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE: Dural arteriovenous fistula (DAVF) is a relatively rare type of cerebrovascular malformation with unknown pathogenesis. Here, the authors report a patient with DAVF in the left transverse-sigmoid sinus (Cognard type III) combined with occlusions of the left sigmoid sinus and right transverse sinus. The authors describe and discuss their successful treatment approach, with the aim to improve the management of this rare disorder.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 59-year-old man presented with dizziness, headache, vomiting, and unsteady gait. His digital subtraction angiography evaluation indicated DAVF in the left transverse-sigmoid sinus (Cognard type III) combined with occlusions of the distal 1/3 of the left sigmoid sinus and the proximal one-third of the right transverse sinus. After balloon angioplasty and stenting, blood flow was restored in the occluded sinuses. The DAVF was treated by embolization. The patient had a satisfactory recovery with significantly improved clinical symptoms.
CONCLUSION: In patients with transverse-sigmoid sinus DAVF, satisfactory venous reflux should be ensured. In patients with concurrent DAVF and sinus stenosis or occlusion, it is important to reestablish antegrade venous blood flow first. It is feasible and safe to simultaneously embolize DAVF after the venous reflux can be reestablished.
