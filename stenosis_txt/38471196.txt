Title: Safety and efficacy of apixaban vs. enoxaparin in thromboprophylaxis after spinal stenosis and degenerative spine surgery.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Degenerative spine surgeries often require postoperative immobilization or reduced mobility, predisposing patients to the formation of thrombosis and higher risk of thromboembolic complications. Despite the significance of this issue, there remains a lack of consensus on the optimal anticoagulant agent for postoperative thromboprophylaxis in spinal stenosis and degenerative spine surgeries. Low molecular weight heparins and direct Xa inhibitors represent two anticoagulant groups with high chemoprophylactic potential.
METHODS: This study included a prospective cohort of patients undergoing posterior decompressive surgery with or without instrumentation for degenerative spine disease and/or spinal stenosis. Patients receiving postoperative prophylactic Enoxaparin and Apixaban were selected to evaluate the rate of complications, as assessed by Clavien-Dindo classification, thromboembolic events, and 30-day mortality, readmission, and reoperation rate between the two anticoagulants.
RESULTS: 130 patients were included in the analysis. 65 patients received Apixaban and Enoxaparin in each group. Mean age of the participants was 57.6Â±11.0. 83.1% underwent laminectomy and posterior spinal fusion, while 22 patients underwent decompressive surgery only. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (P-value=0.403), deep vein thrombosis (p-value=0.999), hematoma formation (p-value=0.403), surgical site infection (p-value=0.901), readmission (p-value=0.545), reoperation (p=0.510), mortality (p=0.648), and complications rate (p-value=0.232) were not statistically different between Enoxaparin and Apixaban.
DISCUSSION: Both Apixaban and Enoxaparin may be viable options for postoperative thromboprophylaxis in spine surgeries with comparable efficacy and safety profile. Future research endeavors should investigate the efficacy of these agents in comparison to placebo in a randomized setting.
