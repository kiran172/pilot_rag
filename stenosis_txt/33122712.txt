Title: Biorheology of occlusive thrombi formation under high shear: in vitro growth and shrinkage.

Abstract: Occlusive thrombi formed under high flow shear rates develop very rapidly in arteries and may lead to myocardial infarction or stroke. Rapid platelet accumulation (RPA) and occlusion of platelet-rich thrombi and clot shrinkage have been studied after flow arrest. However, the influence of margination and shear rate on occlusive clot formation is not fully understood yet. In this study, the influence of flow on the growth and shrinkage of a clot is investigated. Whole blood (WB) and platelet-rich plasma (PRP) were perfused at high shear rates (&gt; 3,000 s-1) through two microfluidic systems with a stenotic section under constant pressure. The stenotic section of the two devices are different in stenotic length (1,000 vs 150 μm) and contraction angle of the stenosis (15° vs 80°). In all experiments, the flow chamber occluded in the stenotic section. Besides a significantly increased lag time and decreased RPA rate for PRP compared to WB (p &lt; 0.01), the device with a shorter stenotic section and steeper contraction angle showed a shear-dependent occlusion and lag time for both PRP and WB. This shear-dependent behavior of the platelet aggregate formation might be caused by the stenotic geometry.
