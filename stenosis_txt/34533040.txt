Title: Outcomes in Patients With Obstructive Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Concomitant Aortic Stenosis Undergoing Surgical Myectomy and Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Background Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and aortic stenosis can cause obstruction to the flow of blood out of the left ventricular outflow tract into the aorta, with obstructive HCM resulting in dynamic left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and moderate or severe aortic stenosis causing fixed obstruction caused by calcific degeneration. We sought to report the characteristics and longer-term outcomes of patients with severe obstructive HCM who also had concomitant moderate or severe aortic stenosis requiring surgical myectomy and aortic valve replacement. Methods and Results We studied 191 consecutive patients (age 67±6 years, 52% men) who underwent myectomy and aortic valve (AV) replacement (90% bioprosthesis) at our center between June 2002 and June 2018. Clinical and echo data including left ventricular outflow tract gradient and indexed AV area were recorded. The primary outcome was death. Prevalence of hypertension (63%) and hyperlipidemia (75%) were high, with a Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 5±4, and 70% of participants had no HCM-related sudden death risk factors. Basal septal thickness and indexed AV area were 1.9±0.4 cm and 0.72±0.2 cm2/m2, respectively, while 100% of patients had dynamic left ventricular outflow tract gradient &gt;50 mm Hg. At 6.5±4 years, 52 (27%) patients died (1.5% in-hospital deaths). One-, 2-, and 5-year survival in the current study sample was 94%, 91%, and 83%, respectively, similar to an age-sex-matched general US population. On multivariate Cox survival analysis, age (hazard ratio [HR], 1.65; 95% CI, 1.24-2.18), chronic kidney disease (HR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.21-2.32), and right ventricular systolic pressure on preoperative echocardiography (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05-1.57) were associated with longer-term mortality, but traditional HCM risk factors did not. Conclusions In symptomatic patients with severely obstructive HCM and moderate or severe aortic stenosis undergoing a combined surgical myectomy and AV replacement at our center, the observed postoperative mortality was significantly lower than the expected mortality, and the longer-term survival was similar to a normal age-sex-matched US population.
