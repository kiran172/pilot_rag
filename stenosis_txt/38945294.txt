Title: Hepatic Artery Thrombectomy after Orthotopic Liver Transplantation: A Stent Retriever and/or Aspiration-Guided Catheter Approach.

Abstract: Retransplantation has been the primary treatment for hepatic artery thrombosis (HAT) in patients with orthotopic liver transplant (OLT); however, because of scarcity of grafts, endovascular revascularization via mechanical thrombectomy offers an alternative to retransplantation should it provide similar long-term benefits. Data regarding a series of 8 patients with hepatic artery thrombectomies across 10 procedures (1 early HAT and 9 late HAT) utilizing stent retriever and/or suction catheter were collected. All had technically successful restoration of flow with stent placement of the anastomotic stenosis in 8 cases. Two patients required reintervention for HAT at 18 and 701 days after primary intervention, with the first dying from liver failure but with a patent hepatic artery on explant. One case had a procedure-related adverse event, hepatic artery dissection, Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR) adverse event classification of 2. Technical success was achieved in all procedures, demonstrating promise in effectively treating HAT in patients with OLT.
