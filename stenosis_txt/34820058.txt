Title: Early repolarization and the severity of coronary artery disease: A case-control study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Early repolarization (ER) is a common finding of the routine electrocardiogram (ECG). The ER usually considered a benign ECG finding, nevertheless a controversy. This study was conducted to investigate the relationship between early repolarization (ER) and the severity of coronary artery disease in patients with a diagnostic coronary angiography.
METHODS: This case-control study included ninety patients (45 patients and 45 control groups) with a diagnostic angiography and was conducted in 2015. After obtaining informed consent, patients with angiography for ER were considered as cases and those for other purposes were as controls. Data were analyzed using SPSS software Version 16. A p-value lesser than 0.05 was significant.
RESULTS: The frequency of ER was higher in men (75.6%), and there was a significant relationship between sex and ER (P=0.003). The mean age of the patients in the ER group was lower than that of non-ER patients, but not statistically significant (P=0.1). Abnormal angiography was more prevalent in patients with ER than non-ER patients (59.6% vs. 40.4%). ER morphology showed a significant correlation to abnormal angiography and also stenosis severity (P=0.035).
CONCLUSION: ER was higher in men than in women. There was a significant correlation between the existence of ER morphology and atherosclerosis severity. Screening programs for ER detection may reduce the risk of arrhythmias and prevent related complications.
