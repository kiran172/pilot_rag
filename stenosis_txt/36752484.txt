Title: Very High-Power Short-Duration, Temperature-Controlled Radiofrequency Ablation in Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation: The Prospective Multicenter Q-FFICIENCY Trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: QDOT MICRO (QDM) is a novel contact force-sensing catheter optimized for temperature-controlled radiofrequency (RF) ablation. The very high-power short-duration (vHPSD) algorithm modulates power, maintaining target temperature during 90 W ablations for ≤4 seconds.
OBJECTIVES: This study aims to evaluate safety and 12-month effectiveness of the QDM catheter in paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation using the vHPSD mode combined with conventional-power temperature-controlled (CPTC) mode.
METHODS: In this prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study, patients with drug-refractory, symptomatic paroxysmal AF underwent pulmonary vein (PV) isolation with QDM catheter with vHPSD as primary ablation mode, with optional use of the CPTC mode (25 to 50 W) for PV touch-up or non-PV ablation. The primary safety endpoint was incidence of primary adverse events within ≤7 days of ablation. The primary effectiveness endpoint was freedom from documented atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence and acute procedural, repeat ablation, and antiarrhythmic drug failure.
RESULTS: Of 191 enrolled participants, 166 had the catheter inserted, received RF ablation, and met eligibility criteria. Median procedural, RF application for ablating PVs, and fluoroscopy times were 132.0, 8.0, and 9.1 minutes, respectively. The primary adverse event rate was 3.6%. Imaging conducted in a subset of participants (n = 40) at 3 months did not show moderate or severe PV stenosis. The Kaplan-Meier estimated 12-month rate for primary effectiveness success was 76.7%; freedom from atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence was 82.1%; clinical success (freedom from symptomatic recurrence) was 86.0%; and freedom from repeat ablation was 92.1%.
CONCLUSIONS: Temperature-controlled paroxysmal AF ablation with the novel QDM catheter in vHPSD mode (90 W, ≤4 seconds), alone or with CPTC mode (25 to 50 W), is highly efficient and effective without compromising safety.
