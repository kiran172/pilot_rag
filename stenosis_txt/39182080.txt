Title: Prognostic effect of the TyG index on patients with severe aortic stenosis following transcatheter aortic valve replacement: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The triglyceride glucose (TyG) index, as a reliable marker of insulin resistance, is associated with the incidence and poor prognosis of various cardiovascular diseases. However, the relationship between the TyG index and clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) remains unclear.
METHODS: This study consecutively enrolled 1569 patients with AS underwent TAVR at West China Hospital of Sichuan University between April 2014 and August 2023. The outcomes of interest included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Multivariate adjusted Cox regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) regression analyses were used to assess the associations between the TyG index and the clinical outcomes. The incremental prognostic value of the TyG index was further assessed by the time-dependent Harrell's C-index, integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and the net reclassification improvement (NRI).
RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 1.09 years, there were 146, 70, and 196 patients experienced all-cause death, cardiovascular death, and MACE, respectively. After fully adjusting for confounders, a per-unit increase of TyG index was associated with a 441% (adjusted HR: 5.41, 95% CI: 4.01-7.32), 385% (adjusted HR: 4.85, 95% CI: 3.16-7.43), and 347% (adjusted HR: 4.47, 95% CI: 3.42-5.85) higher risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality and MACE, respectively. The RCS regression analyses revealed a linear association between TyG index and endpoints (all P for non-linearity > 0.05) with 8.40 as the optimal binary cutoff point. Furthermore, adding TyG index to the basic risk model provided a significant incremental value in predicting poor prognosis (Time-dependent Harrell's C-index increased for all the endpoints; All-cause mortality, IDI: 0.11, P < 0.001; NRI: 0.32, P < 0.001; Cardiovascular mortality, IDI: 0.043, P < 0.001; NRI: 0.37, P < 0.001; MACE, IDI: 0.092, P < 0.001; NRI: 0.32, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe AS receiving TAVR, there was a positive linear relationship between TyG index and poor prognosis, with 8.4 as the optimal bivariate cutoff value. Our findings suggest TyG index holds potential value for risk stratification and guiding therapeutic decisions in patients after TAVR.
