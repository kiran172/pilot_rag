Title: Endovascular stent treatment of the iliac vein stenosis caused by a pelvic lymphocele secondary to gynecologic malignancy.

Abstract: Over the past two years, 6 patients had iliac vein stenosis caused by radiation and pelvic lymphocele secondary to gynecologic malignancy. Patients had symptomatic lymphoceles induced lower limb edema. Poor treatment of symptomatic lymphoceles, compression symptoms persist, all patients were performed endovascular stent therapy, clinical symptoms of lower limb were completely relieved. Iliac vein stenosis caused by radiation and pelvic lymphocele secondary to gynecologic malignancy, endovascular stent placement is a nonsurgical alternative for the reestablishment of venous flow and sustained relief of symptoms.
