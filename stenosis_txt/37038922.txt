Title: Utility of neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio in patients with coronary artery disease: a narrative review.

Abstract: The neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio (NHR) is thought to reflect inflammatory status and dyslipidaemia, both of which play significant roles in coronary artery disease (CAD). The objective of this narrative review is to summarise the results of studies that have explored the utility of NHR for the diagnosis and management of CAD. The PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases were searched for articles related to NHR from their inception to October 2022. Seven relevant articles were obtained for review. There were unclear relationships of NHR with age, sex, smoking status, hypertension and diabetes. However, NHR had a sensitivity and specificity as high as 94.8% and 59%, respectively, for the identification of significant coronary stenosis. NHR was also a superior predictor of prognosis to conventional parameters. NHR had a sensitivity and specificity as high as 77.6% and 74.2%, respectively, for the prediction of adverse events, including mortality, associated with acute coronary syndrome. Thus, NHR could be used in clinical cardiovascular medicine for risk stratification and the prediction of the short-term and long-term outcomes of CAD. However, more studies are required before a quantitative assessment of the efficacy of NHR for use in patient management can be completed.
