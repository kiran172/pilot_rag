Title: [Prevalence and intervention effect of arteriovenous graft stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the prevalence, intervention methods and effect of arteriovenous graft (AVG) stenosis. Methods: The clinical data of patients who received AVG in the Blood Purification Center, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from January 2018 to December 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. The patency rate, prevalence and intervention effect of AVG stenosis were analyzed. Results: A total of 475 patients aged (55.5Â±11.8) years were included, and there were 193 male cases (40.6%) and 282 female cases (59.4%). The patients were followed up for [M (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>)] 19 (12, 30) months, and the primary, assisted primary and secondary patency were 14 (5, 27), 27 (13, 55), and 59 (33, 65) months, respectively. There were 799 access events which needed intervention, with a total standardized intervention rate of 0.90 per patient-year. Totally, 431(53.9%, 431/799) stenosis events occurred in 207 AVG. Among 422 AVG stenosis events with complete clinical data, 57.8% (244/422) were multi-site stenosis and 42.2% (178/422) were single-site stenosis. The most common sites of stenosis were graft-vein anastomosis (47.6%, 340/715), venous outflows (22.7%, 162/715), and puncture zone (20.0%, 143/715). In the 414 stenosis with intact follow-up data, 90.8% (376/414) were treated by balloon angioplasty, 8.5% (35/414) received covered stent insertion, and 0.7% (3/414) were intervened by open surgery. Clinical success rate was 98.1% (406/414). The primary patency time after endovascular treatment was 6 (4, 12) months. Covered stent significantly increased post-intervention primary patency time compared withballoon angioplasty [6 (3, 7) months vs 3 (1, 4) months, P=0.020]. Conclusions: Stenosis is the most common complication of AVG, and the most common sites are graft-vein anastomosis, venous outflows, and puncture zone. Intervention of AVG stenosis has a high clinical success rate, and a relatively low post-intervention patency. Covered stent insertion improves the post-intervention patency of AVG, which has a poor effect using balloon expansion.
