Title: Percutaneous Treatment of Benign Biliary Anastomotic Strictures: Retrievable Covered Self-Expandable Metal Stent with Fixation String Versus Large-Bore Catheters.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To retrospectively compare the safety and efficacy of a covered self-expandable metal stent (CSEMS) with a transhepatic fixation string and a large-bore catheter for benign biliary anastomotic stricture after hepatobiliary surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From March 2012 to June 2017, 49 patients with benign biliary anastomotic strictures, untreatable with endoscopy, were included. Twenty-three patients (catheter group) were treated with a large-bore catheter (with progressive catheter upsizing to 16-18 Fr), whereas 26 patients (stent group) were treated by CSEMS (10-mm stent) placement. Technical success, clinical success, primary patency, recurrent strictures, complication rate, and catheter or stent indwelling time were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Technical success and clinical success were achieved in all patients. In the stent group, stent retrieval was successful in all patients. The overall complication rate was 24.5% (catheter group vs. stent group, 30.4% vs. 19.2%; P = .363). Stent migration occurred in 1 patient during follow-up (1/26, 3.8%). The mean indwelling time was 10.3 ± 3.0 months (range, 8-16 months; median, 10 months) in the catheter group and 4.0 ± 1.2 months (range, 3-7 months; median, 4 months) in the stent group (P < .001). Recurrent strictures occurred in 10 (43.5%) patients in the catheter group and 4 (15.4%) patients in the stent group (P = .030). The 1- and 3-year primary patency rates were 82.6% and 69.3% in the catheter group and 92.3% and 84.4% in the stent group (P = .042).
CONCLUSIONS: Percutaneous placement of a retrievable CSEMS showed superior intermediate-term outcomes over a large-bore catheter in patients with benign biliary anastomotic strictures.
