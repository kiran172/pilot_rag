Title: Clinical outcomes of different endovenous procedures among patients with varicose veins and iliac vein compression: A retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the short-term outcomes of three endovenous procedures in patients with varicose veins (VVs) and severe iliac vein compression syndrome (IVCS).
METHODS: A total of 158 consecutive patients were included in this multicenter retrospective study from May 2017 to December 2019; 54 patients underwent endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) alone, 47 patients underwent EVLA and balloon angioplasty (BA), and 57 patients underwent EVLA and stenting angioplasty (SA). Clinical outcomes and complications were assessed at one and twelve months post-surgery. The Quality of life (QoL) was assessed by the venous clinical severity score (VCSS) and Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ).
RESULTS: Patients who underwent the SA procedure were older (P < 0.05). Incidence of laser ablation complications was similar among the three procedures; closure rates of the great saphenous vein were 96.8%, 98.0%, and 98.4%, respectively, at 12 months. Reflux times in the SA procedure were lower than those in the EVLA and BA procedures at 12 months, while ulcer healing time was faster with the SA procedure (P < 0.05) than with the other procedures. The VCSS and AVVQ values were significantly improved post-procedure (P < 0.05), with lower AVVQ scores in the SA procedure than in the EVLA and BA procedures at 12 months post-surgery. The EVLA and BA procedures (stenosis >70%) caused a significantly higher symptom recurrence than the SA procedure, with an odds ratios of 14.04 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.99-99.18) and 10.50 (95% CI, 1.26-87.15), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that EVLA and SA procedures relieve symptoms, improve the QoL, and decrease symptom recurrence in patients with VVs and severe IVCS (stenosis >70%).
