Title: Treatment of balanitis xerotica obliterans in pediatric patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Balanitis xerotica obliterans (BXO) is a chronic inflammatory disease with a little known incidence in pediatric population. The objective of this work was to describe our experience in the treatment of BXO.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective study carried out in 419 patients undergoing circumcision surgery between January 2014 and January 2017. Demographic, clinical, therapeutic, and anatomical and pathological variables, as well as complications during follow-up, were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 419 patients, 41 (9.78%) were diagnosed with BXO. 6 patients were excluded owing to lack of follow-up, so 35 patients were analyzed. Mean age at diagnosis was 8.6 years. Suspicion diagnosis was clinical at physical exploration in 17 patients (48.6%), and at surgery in 18 patients (51.4%). Anatomical and pathological confirmation was performed in a total 35 patients (100%). During follow-up, 6 patients (17.14%) had lesions in the glans, 3 (8.57%) in the urethra, and 9 (25.71%) in both. 6 meatotomies (17.14%) and 5 new circumcisions (14.28%) had to be carried out. Mean recurrence time was 32.43 months. In 19 patients (54.28%), topical corticoids - ointment - were applied, and 1 patient (2.85%) received topical immunosuppressants.
CONCLUSIONS: A close follow-up of patients with clinical or anatomical and pathological diagnosis of BXO is required given its high morbidity. The complications described in pediatric population include meatal and urethral stenosis, as well as recurrent phimosis, unless a sufficient amount of foreskin is resected.
