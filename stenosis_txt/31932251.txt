Title: Calcifications in the neck region of patients with carotid artery stenosis: a computed tomography angiography study of topographic anatomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to map the vertical locations of calcified carotid plaques (CCPs), osseous anatomic structures, and calcified soft tissues in the area of the carotid artery, determine to what extent CCPs are superimposed on the cervical spine in coronal images, and analyze the differences between men and women.
STUDY DESIGN: Computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans of 79 patients were studied. CCPs were discovered in 152 of the total 158 neck sides. Evaluations were performed by using sagittal and coronal reformatted CTA images with maximum intensity projection.
RESULTS: Most of the calcified anatomic structures studied, including the carotid bifurcation, were found in close relationship to the level of the third and fourth cervical vertebrae. In the coronal view, all or most of the areas of the CCPs were superimposed on the cervical spine in 22 of 44 (50%) neck sides with CCP in women and in 37 of 108 (34.2%) in men (P = .070).
CONCLUSIONS: The carotid bifurcation is in close proximity to various calcified anatomic structures. This should be taken into account when diagnosing CCPs in panoramic radiographs. In the coronal view, CCPs and the cervical spine are often superimposed; thus, coronal images are not recommended for confirmation of putative carotid calcifications diagnosed on the basis of panoramic radiographs.
