Title: Balloon pulmonary valvotomy in severe dysplastic pulmonary valve restenosis: A novel maneuver for stabilizing balloon positioning.

Abstract: Balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (BPV) is an interventional procedure that has practically replaced the need of open-heart surgery in patients with severe valvular pulmonary stenosis. However, BPV in dysplastic pulmonary valve (PV) still remains a challenge in the current milieu of advanced technologies. We encountered a unique situation of severe restenosis of PV wherein the attempt to balloon dilate the valve was futile because no balloon remained stable at the level of the valve. This situation was overcome using a PDA device delivery sheath to keep the balloon positioned at the desired location.
