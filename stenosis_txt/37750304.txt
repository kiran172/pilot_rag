Title: Clinical Features and Outcomes Among Patients With Refractory Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest and an Initial Shockable Rhythm.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical features among patients with refractory out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) and initial shockable rhythms of ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia are not well-characterized.
METHODS: We compared clinical characteristics and coronary angiographic findings between patients with refractory OHCA (incessant ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia after ≥3 direct-current shocks) and those without refractory OHCA.
RESULTS: Between 2014 and 2018, a total of 204 patients with ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia OHCA (median age 62; males 78%) were divided into groups with (36%, 74/204) and without refractory arrest (64%, 130/204). Refractory OHCA patients had longer cardiopulmonary resuscitation (23 versus 15 minutes), more frequently required ≥450 mg amiodarone (34% versus 3.8%), and had cardiogenic shock (80% versus 55%) necessitating higher adrenaline dose (4.0 versus 1.0 mg) and higher rates of mechanical ventilation (92% versus 74%; all P&lt;0.01). Of 167 patients (82%) selected for coronary angiography, 33% (n=55) had refractory OHCA (P=0.035). Significant coronary artery disease (≥1 major vessel with &gt;70% stenosis) was present in &gt;70% of patients. Refractory OHCA patients frequently had acute coronary occlusion (64% versus 47%), especially left circumflex (20% versus 6.4%) and graft vessel (7.3% versus 0.9%; all P&lt;0.05) compared with those without refractory OHCA. Refractory OHCA group had higher in-hospital mortality (45% versus 30%, P=0.036) and greater new requirement for dialysis (18% versus 6.3%, P=0.011). After adjustment, refractory OHCA was associated with over 2-fold higher odds of in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 2.28 [95% CI, 1.06-4.89]; P=0.034).
CONCLUSIONS: Refractory ventricular fibrillation/pulseless ventricular tachycardia OHCA was associated with more intensive resuscitation, higher rates of acute coronary occlusion, and poorer in-hospital outcomes, underscoring the need for future studies in this extreme-risk subgroup.
