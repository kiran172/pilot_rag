Title: Successful Treatment of Hemi-Retinal Vein Occlusion with Macular Edema following Spinal Surgery Using Intravitreal Aflibercept and Retinal Photocoagulation: A Case Report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Perioperative visual loss (POVL) owing to hemi-retinal vein occlusion (HRVO) following prone positioning during spinal surgery is rare. Here, we report a case of HRVO with macular edema (ME) after spinal surgery that was successfully treated with intravitreal aflibercept (IVA) injections and retinal photocoagulation (RP).
CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old Japanese man underwent spinal surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Surgery was performed with the patient in the prone position under general anesthesia; the operation time was 305 min. No complications were associated with intraoperative anesthesia. On postoperative day 4, the patient noticed decreased visual acuity in his left eye and visited the Department of Ophthalmology on postoperative day 9. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the left eye was 0.1. Fundus and optical coherence tomography revealed HRVO and ME in the left eye. IVA injections and RP were performed in the eye, which substantially decreased the ME and improved the patient's BCVA to 0.8.
CONCLUSIONS: HRVO can cause POVL after prone positioning during spinal surgery. This is the first case of HRVO with ME after spinal surgery, which was successfully treated with IVA injections and RP.
