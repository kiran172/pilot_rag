Title: Massive hemoptysis in a pregnant woman: the first rare presentation of mitral valve stenosis.

Abstract: Massive hemoptysis is one of the rare manifestations of mitral valve stenosis. Massive hemoptysis is considered as a potentially life threatening that frequently needs emergency procedures. A 43- year-old pregnant woman presented with coughing and massive hemoptysis. She was diagnosed severe rheumatic mitral stenosis. The patient underwent percutaneous transluminal mitral valvuloplasty (PTMC). Before ICU admission and hospitalization, she was healthy, without any past medical history and complaints.
