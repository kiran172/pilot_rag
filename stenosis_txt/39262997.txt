Title: Prevalence of ascending aortic atheromatous plaques and risk factors in Thai cardiac surgery patients: A prospective cohort study.

Abstract: Cerebral embolism, a serious complication in cardiac surgery, is significantly impacted by atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta and aortic arch. However, data on the prevalence of these plaques in Asian populations are sparse. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of atheromatous plaques in the ascending aorta among Thai cardiac surgery patients, thereby facilitating risk stratification and improving preoperative management. We conducted intraoperative epiaortic ultrasound examinations on 239 cardiac surgery patients. Clinically significant atheromatous plaques were defined as those exceeding 3.0 mm in thickness. The collected demographic and clinical data included sex, age, body weight, height, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification, smoking status, alcohol consumption, and comorbidities. Atheromatous plaques were found in 33.5 % of the ascending aortas and 41.4 % of the aortic arches. The primary risk factors were advanced age (over 80 years; relative risk (RR) 1.444, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.113-1.874, P = 0.006) and carotid stenosis (RR 1.247, 95 % CI 1.04-1.495, P = 0.017). The prevalence of atheromatous plaques in Thai cardiac surgery patients was significant, with older age and carotid stenosis being major risk factors. Preoperative aortic imaging, such as computed tomography angiography or epiaortic ultrasound, should be applied to cardiac surgery candidates. In resource-limited settings, prioritizing patients of advanced age or those with carotid stenosis for imaging is advised.
