Title: Single rotation CTA of extracranial carotids integrated with cerebral CTP provides sufficient quality for decision making in patients with ischaemic stroke.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Large volume computed tomography scanners with 16 cm Z-axis single rotation coverage enable joggle-mode scanning of cerebral computed tomography perfusion and single rotation computed tomography angiography of cervical arteries. Our study aims to evaluate the feasibility of scanning cervical arteries, acquired with single rotation computed tomography angiography during computed tomography perfusion in ischaemic stroke patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 143 patients were scanned with a single contrast medium injection of 60 ml. Hounsfield units of the cervical arteries and veins were objectively measured and carotid bifurcations were subjectively reviewed. The incidence of artefacts and supra-aortic vessel coverage was recorded.
RESULTS: Single rotation computed tomography angiography of the neck demonstrated supra-aortic vessels to their origins in 58 (40.6%) patients. Ninety-nine per cent (1140/1152) of arterial segments were adequately opacified (â‰¥150 Hounsfield units). Arteries were adequately contrasted compared to veins in 81.3% (915/1126) of segments. However, the opacification was reversed in 14.0% (158/1126) of segments, indicating a delayed timing of acquisition; 95.5% (273/286) of carotid bifurcations were of good image quality. Measurement of internal carotid artery stenosis in single rotation computed tomography angiography according to the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial correlated well with digital subtraction angiography (R=0.87, P&lt;0.05). Significant artefacts resulted from metal/dental implants (10.5%), contrast in central veins (7.7%) and the shoulder region (4.9%).
CONCLUSION: Single rotation computed tomography angiography of the neck incorporated into cerebral computed tomography perfusion with single contrast medium administration revealed adequate image quality for further decision-making in our patient sample. The main drawbacks were inadequate coverage of supra-aortic arteries and possible delay in timing of the joggle.
