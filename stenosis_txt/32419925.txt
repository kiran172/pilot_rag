Title: Recent Advances in treatment of urethral stricture disease in men.

Abstract: Urethral stricturing is a narrowing of the urethral lumenÂ as a result of ischaemic spongiofibrosis. The main challenge of currently available treatment options is recurrence of the stricture. Recent advancements in the treatment of urethral strictures mainly came from the fields of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Research efforts have primarily focused on decreasing the recurrence of stricture after internal urethrotomy and constructing tissue-engineered urethral substitutes to improve clinical outcomes of urethroplasty surgeries. The aim of this article is to review the most recent advancements in the management of urethral stricture disease in men.
