Title: Left ventricular mechanical dispersion as a predictor of the need for pacemaker implantation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: MeDiPace TAVI study.

Abstract: AIMS: Permanent pacemaker (PM) implantation is common after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Left ventricular mechanical dispersion (MeDi) by speckle tracking echocardiography is a marker of fibrosis that causes alterations in the conduction system. We hypothesized that MeDi can be a predictor of the need for PM implantation after TAVI.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutively, 200 TAVI patients were enrolled. Transthoracic echocardiography and electrocardiography examinations were recorded before TAVI to evaluate global longitudinal strain (GLS), MeDi, and conduction disturbances. PM implantation information was obtained 3 months after TAVI. Patients were stratified into PM or no PM group. Mean age was 80 + 7 years (44% women). Twenty-nine patients (16%) received PM. MeDi, QRS duration, existence of right bundle branch abnormality (RBBB), and first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block were significantly different between groups. MeDi was 57 ± 15 ms and 48 ± 12 ms in PM and no PM groups, respectively (P < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, MeDi predicted the need for PM after TAVI independently of GLS, QRS duration, RBBB, and first-degree AV block [odds ratio (OR): 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.22-2.45] with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.68 in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Moreover, RBBB was an independent predictor of PM need after TAVI (OR: 8.98, 95% CI: 1.78-45.03). When added to RBBB, MeDi had an incremental predictive value with an AUC of 0.73 in ROC curves (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: MeDi may be used as an echocardiographic functional predictor of the need for PM after TAVI.
