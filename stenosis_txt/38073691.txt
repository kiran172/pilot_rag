Title: Median arcuate ligament syndrome complicated with gallbladder stones: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare disease caused by compression of the celiac trunk artery by the median arcuate ligament (MAL). It can cause symptoms of postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and nausea and vomiting.
CASE SUMMARY: A 55-year-old woman was admitted due to abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. On admission, the patient presented with epigastric pain that worsened after eating, without signs of peritoneal irritation. Computed tomography angiography of the upper abdomen showed compression of the proximal segment of the abdominal trunk, local luminal stenosis with angular "fishhook" changes, which changed significantly during forceful inspiration and expiration; gallbladder stones; and multiple cysts in the liver. Abdominal duplex ultrasonography showed that peak systolic velocity was 352 cm/s. After diagnosis of MALS was confirmed, an arch ligament release procedure was performed. MALS has no specific symptoms and can be misdiagnosed as other abdominal diseases. Awareness of MALS should be improved to avoid misdiagnosis. The commonly used treatment option is MAL release and resection of the peripheral ganglion of the celiac trunk artery.
CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and treatment of MALS must be individualized, and MAL release is effective and provides immediate symptomatic relief.
