Title: The efficacy and safety of domestic and imported rapamycin drug-eluting stents and paclitaxel drug-coated balloons in the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to analyze the efficacy and safety of domestic and imported rapamycin drug-eluting stents (DES) and paclitaxel drug-coated balloons (DCB) in the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions.
METHODS: A total of 98 patients with coronary bifurcation lesions treated in our hospital from January 2019 to December 2019 were recruited as the study cohort and divided into four groups according to the different treatment method each patient underwent, including group A (n=25, treated with domestic rapamycin DES), group B (n=21, treated with imported rapamycin DES), group C (n=29, treated with domestic paclitaxel DCB), and group D (n=23, treated with imported paclitaxel DCB). The minimum lumen diameters (MLD), the diameter stenosis rates, the late lumen losses (LLLs), and the incidence of adverse events in each group were compared.
RESULTS: The MLD in the four groups were increased immediately after the surgeries and at nine months after the surgeries (P&lt;0.05), and the diameter stenosis rates were decreased (P&lt;0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the MLD or the diameter stenosis rates among the four groups before the surgeries, immediately after the surgeries, or at nine months after the surgeries (P&gt;0.05). The LLLs of groups A and B were significantly higher than the LLLs of groups C and D (P&lt;0.05). Compared with the incidences of major adverse cardiovascular events (16.00% vs. 14.29% vs. 13.79% vs. 17.39%) and the incidences of restenosis (8.00% vs. 4.76% vs. 6.90% vs. 4.35%) in groups A, B, C, and D, there were no significant differences (P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Domestic and imported rapamycin DES and paclitaxel DCB can effectively improve MLD, reduce the diameter stenosis rate, and have fewer adverse events in the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions, and domestic and imported paclitaxel DCB have lower LLLs.
