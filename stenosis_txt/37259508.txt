Title: Trauma-Induced Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome is an Under-Recognized Source of Chronic Abdominal Pain.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) can be a debilitating condition resulting in epigastric pain, nausea, difficulty eating due to postprandial pain, weight loss, and malnutrition in otherwise healthy individuals. The pain is caused by the compression of the celiac artery and neural ganglia by the median arcuate ligament as it attaches from the spine to the diaphragm. Diagnostic imaging, either duplex or angiography, can show the abnormality however, vague symptoms can lead to a missed diagnosis. While MALS is a known anatomical variation in the population, to our knowledge, has not been identified to be caused by trauma. Here, we present 4 patients who developed MALS following abdominal or spinal trauma whom all required surgery to alleviate lifestyle-limiting pain.
