Title: A Case Series of Acute Painless Bilateral Foot Drop Without Cauda Equina Syndrome.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Acute painless bilateral foot drop without bowel/bladder involvement is a very rare presentation of lumbar degenerative disorders. Only a few cases have been published on it in the literature. An early intervention could prove to be very helpful for the neurological recovery.
CASE REPORT: We present three cases where patients developed acute onset bilateral foot drop without radiculopathy and without bowel/bladder involvement. The first case was due to acute lumbar disc herniation, the second was caused by acute disc prolapse in a pre-existing asymptomatic lumbar canal stenosis, and the third one precipitated in a progressive degenerative severe lumbar spinal stenosis. Two cases (case reports 1 and 3) underwent minimal invasive decompression while the other case (case report 2) underwent instrumentation+ decompression + fusion. Case 1 and 2 with a short duration of symptoms showed good neurological recovery, whileereas Case 3 with longer duration of complaints did not improve.
CONCLUSION: Patients presenting with painless bilateral foot drop without cauda equine syndrome should be evaluated for spinal causes besides central nervous systemCNS, peripheral nerve, metabolic and autoimmune causes. Any finding in support of lumbar degenerative disease as the cause after excluding other causes should prompt for surgical decompression of the spine as an early intervention might help patient recover back to a normal and active lifestyle.
