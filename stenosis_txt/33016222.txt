Title: Optical coherence tomography: assessment of coronary artery disease and guide to percutaneous coronary intervention.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Angiographic guidance for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has significant limitations in interpretation. The superior spatial resolution of optical coherence tomography (OCT) can provide meaningful clinical benefits, although limited data is available on Asian populations. This study aimed to determine whether OCT can provide additional advantages and useful clinical information beyond that obtained by angiography alone in decision making for PCI.
METHODS: This was an observational study based on a single tertiary cardiac center in Pakistan, which includes 67 patients who underwent coronary angiogram and stenting. Their pre and post stenting OCT findings were recorded. Any additional intervention was also recorded. The data were analysed using IBM SPSS software version 26.0.
RESULTS: The mean age was 55.00 ± 9.00 years. Majority of the patients were males (65.7%). On angiography, there was an equal number of stable and ruptured plaques (38.8%). Post stenting results showed 29.9% under deployed stents and 34.3% were either undersized or mal-apposed. Out of 67 patients, 50 (74.6%) needed re-intervention after PCI. Among different procedures, post-dilatation was most common.
CONCLUSION: The main OCT benefit is in borderline lesions on CA, in whom OCT identifies significant coronary stenosis and leads to PCI indication in patients. In the post-PCI context, OCT leads to an indication of PCI optimisation in half of the coronary lesions.
