Title: Multiple Aneurysms of the Subclavian-Axillary, Abdominal Aortoiliac, Lower Extremity, and Coronary Arteries in A Pediatric Patient of Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis affecting mainly the aorta and its branches. Stenosis and occlusion of the involved vessels usually develop; however, their dilation and aneurysmal formation are extremely rare. Although aneurysmal disease has been reported in adults with Takayasu arteritis, it is a rare entity in children. The present report described an 11-year-old male found to have the subclavian-axillary, abdominal aortoiliac, lower extremity artery aneurysms with mural thrombi. Aneurysms were also found at the proximal and middle segments of the right coronary artery. The patient was conservatively treated with corticosteroid in addition to antiplatelet and anticoagulation agents.
