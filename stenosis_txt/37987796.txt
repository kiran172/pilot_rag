Title: I-C-F-6 attenuates chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-induced neurological injury in mice by modulating microglia polarization.

Abstract: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is the leading cause of chronic cerebral dysfunction syndrome with its complex pathological mechanisms involving cortical and hippocampal neuronal loss, white matter lesions, and neuroinflammation. I-C-F-6 is a septapeptide, which has anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects. This study aimed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of I-C-F-6 in chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH)-induced neurological injury. C57BL/6 J mice were subjected to bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS), and BV2 microglia cells were induced with oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). In vivo, mice were divided randomly into four groups: Sham, BCAS, GBE (30 mg/kg), and I-C-F-6 (0.5 mg/kg). In vitro, microglia were divided randomly into four groups: control, OGD, I-C-F-6 (25 μg/mL), and Shikonin (800 nmol/L). Through LFB, TUNEL, and NeuN staining, we found that I-C-F-6 was able to mitigate myelin pathology and reduce the number of apoptotic neurons. Furthermore, immunofluorescence staining revealed that I-C-F-6 was able to reduce microglia clustering and downregulate NF-κB p65. We also observed a significant downregulation of M1 phenotype microglia signature genes, such as TNF-α, iNOS, and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as Arg-1 and IL-10, indicating that I-C-F-6 may mainly reduce polarization towards the M1 phenotype in microglia. Notably, I-C-F-6 downregulated the expression of NF-κB signaling pathway-related proteins IKK-β and NF-κB p65, as well as pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β and iNOS. In conclusion, I-C-F-6 can improve neurological damage, alleviate neuroinflammation, and inhibit microglia polarization to the M1 phenotype via the NF-κB signaling pathway.
