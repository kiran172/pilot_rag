Title: Concomitant surgical aortic valve replacement with bilateral orthotopic lung transplantation.

Abstract: Concomitant cardiac surgery at the time of lung transplantation while uncommon has been shown to have acceptable morbidity and mortality. We present a case of a 66-year-old man with a history of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis with end-stage lung disease who presented with moderate aortic stenosis and severe aortic regurgitation. He underwent a bioprosthetic surgical aortic valve replacement at the time of bilateral orthotopic lung transplant and recovered without any major complications.
