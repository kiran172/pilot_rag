Title: Transient Ischemic Attack Shakes: A Case Report.

Abstract: Transient ischemic attack (TIA) shakes can present as epilepsy which could lead to misdiagnosis. When a patient present with neurological findings we must ensure our differentials remain broad. As a physician, we must ensure our role in analyzing the full clinical picture of our patients. We present the case of a 75-year-old man with multiple comorbidities who presented with limb shaking and seizure-like symptoms and who was found to have bilateral carotid stenosis. After finding bilateral carotid stenosis, it ultimately led to the diagnosis of "TIA Shakes." Overall, this case re-emphasizes the importance of diagnosis and correctly managing our patients.
