Title: Correlation between microalbuminuria and atherosclerotic intracranial and extracranial arterial stenosis in patients with cerebral infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Microalbuminuria (MAU) reflects the generalized vascular endothelial dysfunction. Whether MAU has correlation with atherosclerotic intracranial and extracranial arterial stenosis in cerebral infarction patients is not known and is explored in the present investigation.
METHODS: We enrolled 255 cerebral infarction patients hospitalized at the department of neurology. All patients underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to evaluate the severity and distribution of intracranial and extracranial arterial stenosis. MAU was expressed as the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). We collected basic information, medical history reviews and laboratory results of each participant. The multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to analyze the risk factors for severity and distribution of cerebral arterial stenosis.
RESULTS: The prevalence of MAU in patients with cerebral infarction was 39.2%, patients with MAU had older age, lower blood uric acid, higher systolic blood pressure (SBP), higher prevalence of hypertension and diabetes (p < 0.05) and higher incidence of atherosclerotic intracranial and extracranial arterial stenosis (χ2 = 5.900, p = 0.015). In multiple logistic regression analysis for intracranial and extracranial arterial stenosis more than 50% or occlusion groups, UACR (OR 1.088 95%CI 1.012-1.170p = 0.022), male (OR 2.196 95%CI 1.085-4.442p = 0.029) as well as SBP (OR 5.870 95%CI 1.026-1.048p = 0.015) showed statistical significance. But UACR had no correlation with the distribution of intracranial and extracranial artery stenosis after adjusting for all potential confounders.
CONCLUSIONS: Microalbuminuria was an independent risk factor for intracranial and extracranial arterial stenosis more than 50% or occlusion.
