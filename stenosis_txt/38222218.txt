Title: Carotid Artery Stenting Versus Carotid Artery Endarterectomy in Asymptomatic Severe Carotid Stenosis: An Updated Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid artery endarterectomy (CEA) are revascularization options for the management of severe carotid disease in asymptomatic patients. We aimed to compare the peri-procedural outcomes of the two modalities. A systematic review of the databases PUBMED, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library was performed. All the studies that reported periprocedural outcomes (within 30 days) in asymptomatic carotid stenosis patients were included in the meta-analysis. Random effects models with inverse-variance weighting were used to estimate pooled risk ratios (RRs) to compare the outcomes. Fifteen studies (including seven randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. A total of 15251 patients were included, out of which 6419 (42%) underwent CAS and 8832 (57.9%) underwent CEA. There was no statistical difference in the primary composite outcome of death/stroke/myocardial infarction (MI) (RR 1.02, 95% CI [0.69-1.51], p 0.93). No difference was found in the secondary outcome of all-cause mortality. CAS was associated with a slightly lower risk of MI and cranial nerve palsy. CAS was associated with a slightly higher risk of stroke with no difference in the occurrence of disabling stroke or ipsilateral stroke. In general terms, the study confirms equipoise in the two treatment strategies with a higher risk of MI and cranial nerve palsy with CEA and a higher risk of non-disabling stroke with CAS.
