Title: Right Anterior Mini-Thoracotomy for Discrete Fibromembranous Subaortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Discrete fibromembranous subaortic stenosis is a common type of subaortic stenosis causing clinically significant left ventricular outflow obstruction. Surgery for discrete subaortic stenosis is most often performed through a typical midline sternotomy. Herein, we present our experience with an adult patient who underwent a right mini-thoracotomy for subaortic membrane resection with central cannulation under direct operative vision.
