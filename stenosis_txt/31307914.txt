Title: Commissuroplasty as a Main Operative Technique in Rheumatic Mitral Valve Repair: Surgical Experiences and Mid-Term Results.

Abstract: AIM: We aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effectiveness of commissuroplasty in mitral valve repair for rheumatic mitral valve disease. For this purpose, we summarise our experience with this technique and analyse the mid-term postoperative outcomes.
METHOD: We retrospectively evaluated the records of patients with rheumatic valve disease who underwent mitral valve repair between January 2011 and January 2018 at our centre. Detailed follow-up data were collected. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve for survival free from reoperation and valve failure was constructed. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of relevant end points (death, reoperation, and valve failure).
RESULTS: A total of 362 patients underwent rheumatic mitral valve repair during the study period. Mitral valve stenosis was the primary pathological feature. Almost all surgeries were accomplished via commissuroplasty. The mean duration of follow-up was 25.57 ± 19.91 months. Twenty-two (22) endpoint events were noted during follow-up. The 2- and 7-year rates of survival free from reoperation and valve failure were 93.9%±1.4% and 91.5%±2.0%, respectively. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that left atrial anteroposterior diameter >60 mm (hazard ratio, 5.2; p < 0.001) was an independent predictor of all endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: Most Chinese patients with rheumatic valve disease were treated effectively via commissuroplasty combined with other surgical procedures, and the mid-term postoperative outcomes were satisfactory.
