Title: [Evolution of transcatheter aortic valve implantation from a high-volume Italian center: report of 2058 procedures over 15-year experience].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To assess the longitudinal changes in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) practice and patients' outcomes in a high-volume Italian center.
METHODS: We analyzed all patients undergoing TAVI at our Institution from June 2007 to August 2021. We stratified the overall population considering four time periods according to procedural advancements and changes in clinical practice: period 1 (2007-2009, n=107) vs period 2 (2010-2014, n=449) vs period 3 (2015-2019, n=864) vs period 4 (2019-2021, n=638). Baseline and procedural characteristics, and in-hospital outcomes among the four groups were compared.
RESULTS: A total of 2058 patients underwent TAVI receiving all the available devices. Patients had a median age of 82 years (78-85) with no differences among time periods. A stepwise reduction of median Society of Thoracic Surgeons mortality risk score (3.7 [2.8-5.3] vs 3.6 [2.6-5.4] vs 3.6 [2.5-5.5] vs 3.3 [2.2-4.9]; p=0.01) was observed. In-hospital all-cause-death (7.5% vs 5.1% vs 2.9% vs 3.0%; p<0.05), major stroke (4.7% vs 0.7% vs 1.0% vs 0.8%; p<0.05), major vascular complications (17.8% vs 8.7% vs 10.5% vs 5.8%; p<0.05) and permanent pacemaker implantation (23.4% vs 12.0% vs 8.7% vs 8.8%; p<0.05) rates significantly lowered over time. Device success markedly improved (80.4% vs 87.1% vs 95.0% vs 96.3%; p<0.05) with significant improvement of paravalvular regurgitation after TAVI (moderate-to-severe 16.8% vs 8.1% vs 0.7% vs 0.2%; mild 61.4% vs 38.2% vs 38.5% vs 25.6%; p<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: All-cause death and in-hospital outcomes of patients undergoing TAVI significantly improved accordingly to technical advancements and changes in clinical practice over 15-year experience.
