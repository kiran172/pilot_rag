Title: Large bowel obstruction secondary to schistosomiasis-related colonic stricture.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Intestinal involvement of schistosomiasis uncommonly involves the formation of non-obstructive polypoid lesions; however, obstructing fibrotic stenoses and strictures secondary to chronic infection are extremely rare with only nine reported cases in the literature.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: An 85-year-old Southeast Asian female originating from the Philippines presents with a one-day history of obstructive symptoms in the setting of chronic constipation over the past four months. Subsequent CT imaging and colonoscopy biopsy revealed a nodular cecal mural wall thickening with chronic inflammation and a single Schistosoma egg. Despite treatment with praziquantel, and medical optimization the patient did not improve. Additionally, a malignancy as the underlying cause of obstruction could not be ruled out as such, she had a right hemicolectomy. Final pathology confirmed the diagnosis of intestinal submucosal schistosomiasis causing fibrotic stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Obstructing lesions including fibrotic stenoses secondary to Schistosomiasis infection can be managed safely with medical co-morbidity optimization when possible, treatment with Praziquantel and surgical resection of the involved area of colon. Given the risk of malignancy and the inability to clinically distinguish between infectious and neoplastic processes, surgical management is recommended.
