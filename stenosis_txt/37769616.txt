Title: Traumatic transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: A 76-year-old female with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis underwent cardiac CT angiography imaging. Severe calcification of the ascending aorta (porcelain aorta) (Figures 1A and 1B) precluded surgical aortic valve replacement. The aortic annular area, perimeter, and diameter were 372 mm2, 68.5 mm, and 20 mm, respectively. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was performed with direct implantation of a 23 mm Sapien S3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences). The valve was delivered via the right femoral artery and a pigtail catheter was delivered to the aortic root via the left femoral artery. The balloon ruptured during valve implantation (Video).
