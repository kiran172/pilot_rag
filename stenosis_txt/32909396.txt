Title: Prognostic value of Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form with aortic valve stenosis following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: Older adults at risk for malnutrition are known to have a high mortality rate. This study aimed to investigate whether the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA-SF) could predict midterm mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: We applied the MNA-SF in 288 patients who had undergone TAVI from January 2016 to June 2019 at the St. Marianna University School of Medicine hospital. Using the MNA-SF cut-off value to indicate the risk of malnutrition, patients were divided into two groups, namely, those with an MNA-SF score ≤11 (impaired MNA-SF group) and those with an MNA-SF score ≥12 (maintained MNA-SF group). We used this value to investigate the association between the MNA-SF and all-cause mortality. Overall, 188 (65%) and 100 (35%) patients comprised the impaired MNA-SF and maintained MNA-SF groups, respectively, and 41 patients died after TAVI (mean follow-up duration, 458 ± 315 days). Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that patients in the impaired MNA-SF group had a significantly higher incidence of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.67; 95% confidence interval 1.29-6.21; P = 0.01). Multivariate Cox regression analyses showed that the MNA-SF score was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality after adjusting for the Society of Thoracic Surgeons risk score, Katz Index, and brain natriuretic peptide test results (hazard ratio 1.14; 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.28; P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: The MNA-SF was useful to screen for the risk of malnutrition in patients with TAVI and in predicting midterm prognoses in patients undergoing TAVI and could predict patient mortality after the procedure.
