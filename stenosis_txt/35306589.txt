Title: Clinically Relevant Late-Onset Biliary Complications After Pancreatoduodenectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Late-onset biliary complications (LBC) after pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) can be serious. This study aimed to clarify the frequency and risk factors of severe LBC after PD.
METHODS: We defined LBC as biliary complications occurring 3 months after PD and severe LBC as cases that required intensive care. A total of 318 patients who underwent PD between 2010 and 2018 with at least 1 year of postoperative follow-up were evaluated.
RESULTS: Hospitalization for severe LBC was required in 59 patients (19%), of whom 20 had liver abscesses (6.3%); 18, acute cholangitis (5.7%); 12, biliary stones (3.8%); and 21, biliary strictures (6.6%). Interventional radiological or endoscopic treatment was required in 32 patients (10%), of whom 9 had a benign primary disease with biliary stones and/or strictures. Thirteen of the remaining 23 patients with a malignant primary disease had liver abscesses and cholangitis. Significant independent risk factors for severe LBC in patients with malignant primary disease were recurrence around the hepaticojejunostomy (odds ratio 6.5, P = 0.013) and chemotherapy (odds ratio 13.5, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Severe LBC after PD may occur regardless of whether the primary disease is benign or malignant. The course of severe LBC differs according to the primary disease, and therefore, appropriate follow-up and optimal treatment should be recommended according to the condition of the patient and the disease state.
