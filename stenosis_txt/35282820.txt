Title: The expression of SAH, IL-1β, Hcy, TNF-α and BDNF in coronary heart disease and its relationship with the severity of coronary stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To investigate the expression of serum S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), serum homocysteine (Hcy), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in coronary heart disease and their relationship with the degree of coronary artery disease.
METHODS: A total of 132 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) from March 2020 to April 2021 were included in this retrospective study. The experimental group was composed of CHD patients, including single-vascular group (46 cases), dual-vascular group (49 cases), and multi-vascular group (37 cases). 145 healthy subjects during the same period for physical examination constituted the control group.
RESULTS: The levels of SAH, IL-1β, Hcy, TNF-α and BDNF in single-vascular group, dual-vascular group and multi-vascular group were higher than that in control group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.05). The serum levels of SAH, IL-1β, Hcy, TNF-α and BDNF in multi-vascular group were higher than those in single-vascular group and dual-vascular group, and the serum levels of SAH, IL-1β, Hcy, TNF-α and BDNF in dual-vascular group were higher than those in single-vascular group, with statistical significance (P < 0.05). Kendall's tau-b correlation showed that the levels of SAH, IL-1β, Hcy, TNF-α and BDNF were positively correlated with the number of stenosis vessels (r = 0.421, 0.533, 0.301, 0.265, 0.678, P = 0.016, 0.009, 0.023, 0.036, 0.004).
CONCLUSION: SAH, IL-1β, Hcy, TNF-α and BDNF in serum of patients with CHD can be used as effective biological indicators to monitor the degree of CHD and severity of coronary stenosis.
