Title: Intracardiac endograft stent of inferior vena cava stenosis after cardiac surgery.

Abstract: Iatrogenic injury of the inferior vena cava is very uncommon but can lead to serious devastating sequelae. This can occur during reoperative or congenital surgery but also during routine cardiac surgery. We have presented a very rare case of a partial obstruction of the inferior vena cava-right atrium junction after multiple cardiac surgeries, which was treated using an endovascular percutaneous approach.
