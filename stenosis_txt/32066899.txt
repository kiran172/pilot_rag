Title: The clinical and histopathological characteristics of Kelly punch punctoplasty.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To examine the clinical presentation, histopathological characteristics and surgical success of patients that underwent Kelly punch punctoplasty.
METHODS: A retrospective consecutive case series of all patients diagnosed with punctal stenosis and referred to Kelly punch punctoplasty and mini-monoka insertion between January 2017 and December 2017. The demographic, clinical and prognosis parameters were retrieved and analyzed. Moreover, a histopathological examination was performed on the tissue retrieved from the Kelly punch at the end of the procedure in order to evaluate the presence of muscle in the tissue, as well as chronic inflammation.
RESULTS: The series was composed of 44 eyes of 28 patients. All patients' complaints prior to surgery were epiphora: 18 patients had bilateral epiphora, 5 presented with right-eye epiphora and 5 with left-eye epiphora. The average Munk degree of epiphora before surgery was 3 and at least 3 months after surgery 1.04 (matched pairs, p < 0.0001). Two patients underwent the second punctoplasty. In haematoxylin and eosin staining, the Riolan muscle was not visible in the mucosal layer in 40 specimens. In four specimens, the muscle was observed. A Masson's trichrome staining ensured that the Riolan muscle existed only in those four specimens.
DISCUSSION: Kelly punch punctoplasty is a simple and minimally invasive procedure for punctal dilation with high functional success rate. Moreover, in histopathological specimens, in all but four of the cases there was no muscle indicated. Intact Riolan muscle enables the punctum to stay in the right circular shape and position, and the lacrimal pump to maintain its pressure gradient.
