Title: Heat stroke with significantly elevated troponin and dynamic ECG changes: Myocardial infarction or myocardial injury?

Abstract: We described an 82-year-old man who was taken to our emergency department after being found unconscious. His electrocardiogram (ECG) showed ST-segment elevation in leads V4-V6 and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was abnormally elevated. In addition to ECG and cTnI changes, this patient was combined with unconsciousness, high fever, abnormal liver function, acute renal failure, and rhabdomyolysis. The initial diagnosis was heat stroke, so cooling measures were initiated immediately, but a concurrent myocardial infarction was suspected. Meanwhile, emergency coronary angiography was performed, but no severe coronary stenosis or thrombosis was found. We first evaluated quantitative flow ratio (QFR) and coronary angiography-derived index of microvascular resistance (ca-IMR) in patients with heat stroke. Ca-IMR was 260 mmHg*s/m in the left circumflex artery, indicating the presence of coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD). After several days of treatment, the patient recovered from multiple organ damage. Therefore, ECG and troponin results should be interpreted carefully in patients with high fever and coma during high temperature seasons.
