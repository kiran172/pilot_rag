Title: Alcohol-Mediated Renal Denervation Using the Peregrine System Infusion Catheter for Treatment of Hypertension.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this multicenter, open-label trial was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alcohol-mediated renal denervation using a novel catheter system (the Peregrine System Infusion Catheter) for the infusion of dehydrated alcohol as a neurolytic agent into the renal periarterial space.
BACKGROUND: The number of hypertensive patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP) remains unacceptably low. The renal sympathetic nervous system has been identified as an attractive therapeutic target.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with uncontrolled hypertension on ≥3 antihypertensive medications underwent bilateral renal denervation using the Peregrine Catheter with 0.6 ml alcohol infused per renal artery.
RESULTS: All patients were treated as intended. Mean 24-h ambulatory BP reduction at 6 months versus baseline was -11 mm Hg (95% confidence interval [CI]: -15 to -7 mm Hg) for systolic BP and -7 mm Hg (95% CI: -9 to -4 mm Hg) for diastolic BP (p < 0.001 for both). Office systolic BP was reduced by -18/-10 mm Hg (95% CI: -25 to -12/-13 to -6 mm Hg) at 6 months. Antihypertensive medications were reduced in 23% and increased in 5% of patients at 6 months. Adherence to the antihypertensive regimen remained stable over time. The primary safety endpoint, defined as the absence of periprocedural major vascular complications, major bleeding, acute kidney injury, or death within 1 month, was met in 96% of patients (95% CI: 85% to 99%). Two patients had major adverse events of periprocedural access-site pseudoaneurysms, with major bleeding in one. There were no deaths or instances of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or renal artery stenosis. Transient microleaks were noted in 42% and 49% of the left and right main renal arteries, respectively. There were 2 cases of minor vessel dissection that resolved without treatment.
CONCLUSIONS: Primary results from this trial suggest that alcohol-mediated renal denervation using the Peregrine Catheter safely reduces blood pressure and as such may represent a novel approach for the treatment of hypertension.
