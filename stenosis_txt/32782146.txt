Title: CXCR3 contributes to neuropathic pain via ERK activation in the anterior cingulate cortex.

Abstract: The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is activated by noxious stimuli and is involved in the affective component of pain processing; but its role in the sensory component of pain remains largely unknown. Studies have verified that Chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3) is involved in nociceptive sensitization in the spinal cord after peripheral nerve injury; however, the expression of CXCR3 in the ACC and its role in neuropathic pain has not been reported. Here, we showed that CXCR3 co-localized with neurons in the ACC and the upregulation of CXCR3 corresponded with hypersensitive behaviors after a chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. Pharmacological blockade of CXCR3 using local injection of its inhibitor, AMG487, into the ACC significantly attenuated hyperalgesia induced by chronic constriction injury and suppressed the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Collectively, these results suggest that CXCR3 in the ACC is involved in hyperalgesia induced by peripheral nerve injury and ERK may be a downstream target.
