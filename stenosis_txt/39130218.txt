Title: Combined Transcervical and Median Sternotomy Approach for a Massive Substernal Goiter.

Abstract: Herein, we describe a combined transcervical and median sternotomy approach for a massive substernal goiter causing tracheal stenosis. A goiter of this size, specifically weighing 630Â g, is rare. We advocate for a multidisciplinary approach for airway management and for consideration of awake fiberoptic intubation with tracheosomy avoidance for similar patients.
