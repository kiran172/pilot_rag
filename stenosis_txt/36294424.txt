Title: Core Lab Adjudication of the ACURATE neo2 Hemodynamic Performance Using Computed-Tomography-Corrected Left Ventricular Outflow Tract Area.

Abstract: (1) Background: Hemodynamic assessment of prosthetic heart valves using conventional 2D transthoracic Echocardiography-Doppler (2D-TTE) has limitations. Of those, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) area measurement is one of the major limitations of the continuity equation, which assumes a circular LVOT. (2) Methods: This study comprised 258 patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), who were treated with the ACURATE neo2. The LVOT area and its dependent Doppler-derived parameters, including effective orifice area (EOA) and stroke volume (SV), in addition to their indexed values, were calculated from post-TAVI 2D-TTE. In addition, the 3D-LVOT area from pre-procedural MDCT scans was obtained and used to calculate corrected Doppler-derived parameters. The incidence rates of prosthesis patient mismatch (PPM) were compared between the 2D-TTE and MDCT-based methods (3) Results: The main results show that the 2D-TTE measured LVOT is significantly smaller than 3D-MDCT (350.4 ± 62.04 mm2 vs. 405.22 ± 81.32 mm2) (95% Credible interval (CrI) of differences: -55.15, -36.09), which resulted in smaller EOA (2.25 ± 0.59 vs. 2.58 ± 0.63 cm2) (Beta = -0.642 (95%CrI of differences: -0.85, -0.43), and lower SV (73.88 ± 21.41 vs. 84.47 ± 22.66 mL), (Beta = -7.29 (95% CrI: -14.45, -0.14)), respectively. PPM incidence appears more frequent with 2D-TTE- than 3D-MDCT-corrected measurements (based on the EOAi) 8.52% vs. 2.32%, respectively. In addition, significant differences regarding the EOA among the three valve sizes (S, M and L) were seen only with the MDCT, but not on 2D-TTE. (4) Conclusions: The corrected continuity equation by combining the 3D-LVOT area from MDCT with the TTE Doppler parameters might provide a more accurate assessment of hemodynamic parameters and PPM diagnosis in patients treated with TAVI. The ACURATE neo2 THV has a large EOA and low incidence of PPM using the 3D-corrected LVOT area than on 2D-TTE. These findings need further confirmation on long-term follow-up and in other studies.
