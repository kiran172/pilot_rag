Title: Simultaneous Transcatheter Closure of a Ventricular Septal Defect and Pulmonary Valvuloplasty: A Case Report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are the most common form of birth defects, affecting the structure and function of neonatal hearts. Pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) and ventricular septal defects (VSD) are 2 of the more prevalent forms, both of which can lead to significant morbidity if left untreated. The emergence of transcatheter techniques has revolutionized the therapeutic landscape, presenting minimally invasive yet effective alternatives to open-heart surgery and significantly reducing associated patient morbidity and recovery time. CASE REPORT The presented case details the management of a 19-year-old man with complex CHDs, highlighting the nuanced decision-making process that led to a transcatheter approach. The patient's clinical presentation, marked by symptoms reflective of significant cardiac compromise, demanded a tailored approach that utilized the latest advancements in non-surgical intervention. The successful closure of the VSD with an Amplatzer device and the resolution of PVS via balloon valvuloplasty were achieved without complications, showcasing the potential of these techniques in managing similar cases. The post-intervention period was marked by a noteworthy recovery, confirming the procedural efficacy and enhancing the patient's quality of life. CONCLUSIONS The favorable outcome of this case highlights the pivotal role of transcatheter interventions in treating complex CHDs and suggests a shift towards less invasive approaches in cardiac care. This case contributes valuable insights to the existing body of evidence, reinforcing the potential of transcatheter techniques to become the preferred treatment modality. With promising immediate and short-term results, these techniques highlight the need for continued research into their long-term efficacy and application across diverse patient demographics.
