Title: The role of far-field intravascular ultrasound in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Precise and accurate characterization of the aortic valve complex is a vital step in the procedure planning for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Far-field intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a novel technology that can be utilized to assess aortic valve annulus and predict paravalvular leak, with comparable results to multi-detector computed tomography-the current gold standard in the preprocedural planning in TAVR. Far-field IVUS carries the advantage of minimal contrast use and lower radiation exposure. In this commentary, we describe two cases of far-field IVUS use during TAVR procedures and review its role as a complementary tool to current the imaging modalities used in TAVR.
