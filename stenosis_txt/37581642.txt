Title: Procedural safety of transcatheter aortic valve replacement with Portico valve: a systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Portico transcatheter aortic heart valve is a self-expandable, fully resheathable bioprosthetic valve with a nitinol frame and porcine pericardial sealing cuff. It has been used among symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS) who are at high or extreme surgical risk. However, till date very few studies has been reported with inconclusive evidence for its postprocedure safety outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: The authors aim to evaluate the safety of the Portico transcatheter aortic valve replacement system among patients with AS.
METHODOLOGY: The authors conducted a systematic literature search on PubMed, Embase, and Scopus from inception till 10th April 2023 by using predefined MESH terms using 'AND' and 'OR'. The following search terms were used: 'Aortic Stenosis' AND 'Transcatheter aortic valve replacement' OR 'Portico valve'. Finally, descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data in this paper. The mean and SD were adopted to describe continuous variables, whereas frequencies and percentages were used for dichotomous data.
RESULTS: A total of 7 studies with 2782 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age of patients was 82.3 years, and 54.63% were female. The most common comorbidity was hypertension (65.21%) and diabetes mellitus (26.45%). Among patients of AS with Portico valve implants, postprocedural outcomes including 30-day mortality (2.32%), cardiovascular mortality (2.37%), stroke (2.23%), myocardial infarction (0.94%), major bleeding (3.97%), major vascular complications (4.91%), acute kidney injury (1.37%), and permanent pacemaker implantations in 15.73% patients were reported. Overall, device success was observed in 95.82% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement with the repositionable Portico valve, a new bioprosthesis, appears to have a low postprocedural mortality rate and other clinical outcomes in high-risk patients with severe AS.
