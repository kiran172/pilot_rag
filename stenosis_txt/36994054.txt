Title: Congenital heart disease - A complex cardiac anomaly: A case report.

Abstract: Congenital heart disorders (CHDs) are a major cause of juvenile morbidity and mortality in many poor nations, owing to late detection and a lack of talent and facilities for decisive treatments. A case of a newborn baby with atrial septal defect (ASD) with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), tricuspid atresia (TA), and pulmonary valve stenosis is admitted to the pediatric ward. It is a complex cardiac anomaly that leads to mortality and morbidity. We rarely get to see a baby dealing with four major complex heart conditions except in the condition of tetralogy of Fallot. The child was a known case of congenital heart disease. Symptomatic treatment was given and treated with antibiotics.
