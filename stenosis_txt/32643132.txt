Title: The impact of FLAIR vascular hyperintensity on clinical severity and outcome : A retrospective study in stroke patients with proximal middle cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The clinical significance of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery vascular hyperintensity (FVH) has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to clarify the effects of FVH on the clinical severity and long-term prognosis of patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion or severe stenosis.
METHOD: Because their clinical and imaging data is not accessible, we excluded the patients being treated with IV thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Clinical and imaging characteristics were documented in 282 consecutive AIS patients with proximal MCA occlusion or severe stenosis. We assessed clinical severity using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score and clinical outcomes using mRS scores. The average time interval between symptom onset and imaging was 16-18 h. The FVH score according to FVH-ASPECTS ranged from 0 to 7, based on the numbers of territories where FVH is positive.
RESULTS: FVH was observed in 235 (83.33%) of the AIS patients. The FVH(+) group tended to have more alcoholics (65 [27.66%] vs 6 [12.77%], P = 0.032), a higher NIHSS score on the 7th day (3 [1-6] vs 2 [1-3], P = 0.039), more instances of early neurological deterioration (END) (27 [11.4%] vs 1 [2.12%], P = 0.05), and more patients with MCA occlusion (94 [40.00%] vs 3 [6.38%]). Among the patients with positive FVH, a high FVH score represented severe clinical impairment (higher NIHSS score on admission [P = 0.009] and 7th day since admission [P = 0.02]) and poor clinical outcomes. Spearman's rank correlations showed that FVH scores were positively correlated with NIHSS scores on admission and NIHSS scores on the 7th day (P = 0.039; P = 0.017, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In patients with proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion or stenosis ≥ 70%, a high FVH score represented severe clinical impairment and poor clinical outcomes. In acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with proximal MCA occlusion, a high FVH score represented favorable clinical outcomes.
