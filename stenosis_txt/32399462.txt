Title: The Efficacy and Safety of a Promising Single-Channel Endoscopic Closure Technique for Endoscopic Treatment-Related Artificial Ulcers: A Pilot Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS: It is important to appropriately manage patients with procedure-related artificial mucosal ulcers or procedure-related complications. Many endoscopic closure techniques have been reported; however, they often require the use of special devices. We developed a single-channel endoscopic closure technique (SCCT) that can be performed with conventional devices. In the present study, we describe the technique and evaluate its efficacy.
METHODS: Twenty-five consecutive patients who underwent endoscopic treatment and whose artificial ulcer was closed using the SCCT were enrolled in this study. The technical success rate, number of clips for closure, procedure time, complication rate on the day of the procedure, clinical success rates on days 1 and 5, and incidence of severe stenosis of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract at 2 months after the procedure were evaluated.
RESULTS: The median ulcer diameter was 20 mm. The tumor locations were the stomach (n = 19), jejunum (n = 1), and colon (n = 5). The technical success rate was 100% (25/25), and the rate of incomplete closure was 0% (0/25). Eight clips were needed on average. The median procedure time was 18 min (range 5-49 min). The complication rate was 0% (25/25). The clinical success rates on days 1 and 5 were 100% (19/19) and 100% (9/9), respectively. No patients presented stenosis as a late complication at 2 months after the procedure (0/25).
CONCLUSION: The SCCT could be applied in the treatment of artificial ulcers in several parts of the GI tract with a high clinical success rate and no complications. The SCCT appears to be a good option for closing artificial mucosal ulcers.
