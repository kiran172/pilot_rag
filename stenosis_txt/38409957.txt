Title: Endovascular treatment with interwoven nitinol stent for common femoral artery lesions: 2-year outcomes of a single center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The study aimed was to report 2-year outcomes of endovascular treatment with interwoven nitinol (Supera™) stent for common femoral artery (CFA) lesions.
METHODS: We reviewed the clinical data of 20 patients who presented with CFA stenosis or occlusion and underwent balloon angioplasty followed by Supera™ stenting in CFA between February 2016 and January 2022. The outcomes were evaluated in these patients in terms of technical success, post-intervention complications, reintervention, and cumulative patency (1 year, and 2 years).
RESULTS: The study included 20 patients (22 lesions) who presented with isolated CFA lesions (3), iliac lesions involving CFA (6), superficial femoral artery (SFA) lesions involving CFA (8), and extensive lesions from the iliac artery to SFA (5). There were 16 men (80%) with a mean age of 69.7 years (range, 34-83). Hypertension, smoking, and diabetes were found in 15 (75%), 7 (35%), and 7 patients (35%), respectively. Clinical presentations were Rutherford stage 5 (9, 45%), Rutherford stage 4 (5, 25%), Rutherford stage 6 (4, 20%), and Rutherford stage 3 (2, 10%). Technical success was achieved in all patients (100%). The procedures for treatment were isolated CFA Supera™ stenting (1, 4.5%), CFA plus DFA Supera™ stenting (jailed SFA) (2, 9.1%), CFA plus SFA Supera™ stenting (jailed DFA) (8, 36.4%), CFA Supera™ stenting plus bare iliac stenting (Astron) (6, 27.3%), CFA plus SFA Supera™ stenting (jailed DFA) plus bare iliac stenting (Astron) (5, 22.7%), and additional DFA angioplasty (7, 31.8%). The rate of in-hospital mortality and morbidity were 0% and 10%, respectively. Distal embolization after pre-dilatation occurred in 1 patient, and cerebral infarction occurred 12 h after the procedure in 1 patient. The mean follow-up time was 23 months (range, 2-64). During the follow-up period, in-stent occlusion occurred in 2 patients at 9 and 46 months. Re-intervention was performed in 1 patient due to recurrent symptom of claudication. The cumulative primary patency at 1 year and 2 years were 93.3% and 93.3%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Endovascular treatment with interwoven nitinol (Supera™) stent for CFA lesions was associated with acceptable outcomes at 2 years.
