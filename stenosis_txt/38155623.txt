Title: Three cases of open surgical procedures on ileal conduits for the repair of benign ureteroenteric anastomotic strictures after total pelvic exenteration of rectal tumors.

Abstract: Ureteroenteric anastomotic strictures (UEAS) are typical complications after creating an ileal conduit for total pelvic exenteration (TPE) of rectal tumors. We report the ileal conduit for reconstruction in three patients, in the age-range of 47-73 years. Case 1 was when a left-sided UEAS had sufficient length of ureter for anastomosis, Case 2 was a right-sided UEAS with sufficient length of ureter for anastomosis, and Case 3 was a left-sided UEAS with insufficient length of ureter for anastomosis. There were no complications after operation and no recurrence of UEAS. It is important to learn the open surgical procedures for repair of a benign UEAS after TPE of rectal cancers. This has fewer complications and is safe in the long term.
