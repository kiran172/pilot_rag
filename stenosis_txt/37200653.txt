Title: Prevalence and Risk Factors of Carotid Artery Stenosis (CAS) Among Cardiac Surgery Patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cardiac disease and carotid atherosclerosis rates have increased in recent years. Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) has been recognized as a high-risk factor of perioperative stroke among cardiac surgery patients.  Aims: The aims of the study are to identify the prevalence and common risk factors of CAS among patients undergoing cardiac surgery that include coronary artery bypass surgery or valvular cardiac surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted in the radiology department at Medina Cardiac Center, Al Madinah Al-Munawara. The inclusion criteria for the study were patients aged ≥ 20 years who were scheduled for coronary artery bypass surgery or valvular cardiac surgery and had carotid duplex examination before surgery. A Philips X matrix IU22 linear-array ultrasound probe (Philips, Bothell, WA) was used to scan the common carotid artery (CCA), internal carotid artery (ICA), external carotid artery (ECA), and vertebral artery.  Results: Of the 261 patients in this study, 78.5% (n = 205) were male. The mean age of patients was 61.6 ± 11.3 years (median: 62.0; range: 55.5-68.0). The overall prevalence of CAS was 71% (n = 187): 52% (n = 136) with bilateral CAS and 19.5% (n = 51) with unilateral CAS. Age group was significantly associated with bilateral CAS and the severity of CAS (p = 0.001). Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and both diabetes mellitus and hypertension together were significantly associated with CAS status (p &lt; 0.05, for all). A significantly higher proportion of smokers had a mild level of CAS on the left side compared to non-smokers (55.8% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.033). Gender and weight status were not linked to severity of CAS.
CONCLUSION: This study shows a high prevalence of CAS among cardiac surgery patients. In addition, older age, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension were found to be major risk factors for CAS. Gender and weight status were not associated with CAS. Preoperative carotid duplex scan is a useful exam to identify CAS among cardiac surgery patients and, therefore, to predict and reduce postoperative neurological complications.
