Title: Descending aortic translocation for left aortic arch with right descending aorta and coarctation of the aorta.

Abstract: Left aortic arch with right descending aorta associated with coarctation of the aorta is a rare congenital cardiac anomaly. Conventional aortic arch repair in this condition may cause airway compression by the abnormally coursing descending aorta. We present the case of a neonate with this anomaly who underwent successful descending aortic translocation to prevent postoperative left main bronchial stenosis.
