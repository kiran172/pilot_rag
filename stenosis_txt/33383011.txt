Title: Rate of Incomplete Revascularization Following Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting at a Single Institution Between 2007 and 2017.

Abstract: Incomplete revascularization following coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is associated with increased repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction and death. Whether the rate of incomplete revascularization is increasing over time has not been previously described. All patients with multivessel coronary artery disease who underwent isolated and elective CABG at our Institution in 2007 (n = 291) were compared to patients who underwent CABG in 2017 (n = 290). A Revascularization Index Score was created to compare rates of incomplete revascularization between the 2 years based on the coronary anatomy and degree of stenosis. Comparison of the 2 years disclose that the rate of incomplete revascularization increased from 17.9% in 2007 to 28.3% in 2017 (p = 0.003) and was accompanied by a decline in the Revascularization Index Score from 0.73 to 0.67 (p = 0.005). Left ventricular function improved in both groups following CABG. Two-year cardiovascular mortality was significantly higher in the 2017 cohort compared to the 2007 cohort. These differences may be attributable to patient factors including more severe coronary artery disease associated with older age, greater incidence of smoking and previous percutaneous coronary intervention. In conclusion, the rate of incomplete revascularization following CABG significantly increased in 2017 compared to 2007 and was associated with higher cardiovascular mortality.
