Title: Medium-Term Outcomes of Antegrade Continent Enema (ACE): Cairo University Specialized Pediatric Hospital (CUSPH) Experience.

Abstract: AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess the medium-term outcomes of ACE in children with fecal incontinence (FI).
METHOD: Eligible children were recruited from the colorectal clinic between December 2016 and January 2020 and were followed prospectively for 2-6 years. A series of questionnaires were used to assess QOL, patients and parent satisfaction, and to assess the outcomes of the ACE.
RESULT: 24 children aged 6-12 years (mean age 8.17 ± 1.95), including 18 males (75%) and 6 females (25% were studied. Cases included anorectal malformations (45.83%)., Hirschsprung disease (25%), neural tube defects (16.66%), sacrococcygeal teratoma (4.16%), and intractable pseudoincontinence (8.33%). QOL improved from (3) [3 -3] to (16) [16-16],p < 0.05. Fecal incontinence index showed significant improvement: 20 [20-20] versus 3 [0-4],p < 0.05. Bowel symptoms demonstrated improvement in the ability to decide when to pass stools and a decrease in soiling. Stooling survey showed lower scores representing better outcome. ACE questionnaire showed that the range of irrigation volumes used by parents is wide, and that all families recommend the ACE for children with similar condition. Postoperative complications were stenosis (16.66%), stomal prolapse (12.5%), leakage (4.16%), and false passage (4.16%). Satisfaction questionnaire showed a median score of 9 (range, 5-10).
CONCLUSION: ACE is an effective method to keep the child with FI clean, more socially active, and with a better QOL and FII in the medium-term. The reported complications were stenosis, false passage, and leakage. ACE mucosa prolapse is a novel complication picked up on medium-term follow up.
