Title: Simultaneous surgical treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma with tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava and ischemic heart disease own research and literature review.

Abstract: &lt;b&gt; Introduction:&lt;/b&gt; Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Tumor penetration into the inferior vena cava/right atrium is rare, as it occurs only in 34% of HCC patients. There are no clear guidelines for the management of this stage of disease. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Aim:&lt;/b&gt; This is a case report of a patient with HCC and tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava and with advanced coronary artery disease. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt; Materials and methods:&lt;/b&gt; The patient was qualified for a simultaneous cardiac surgery and liver resection with removal of the tumor thrombus from the inferior vena cava due to a high risk of sudden cardiac death. The first stage involved aortocoronary bypass followed by a right-sided hemihepatectomy with removal of the tumor thrombus from the inferior vena cava (this part of the operation was performed by extracorporeal circulation). The postoperative period was uneventful. Surgical treatment is one of the therapeutic options that offers a chance to radically remove the tumor and extend the patient&apos;s life. From a standpoint, these operations are extremely difficult and carry a high risk of perioperative complications (up to 40%). At the same time, the patient is at risk of complications due to cancer, such as pulmonary embolism, tricuspid stenosis, and congestive heart failure, which should be considered when choosing a treatment method. A significant number of patients also suffer from chronic conditions that worsen the prognosis. Cardiac diseases combined with tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava may cause sudden cardiac death. &lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; Surgical treatment should be considered in patients with HCC and tumor thrombus in the inferior vena cava, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease burden, as it is not only a chance to prolong life, but also to protect them against life-threatening cardiac complications.
