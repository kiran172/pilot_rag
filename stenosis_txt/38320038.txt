Title: What Is the Role of Transcarotid Artery Revascularization in the Treatment of Carotid Stenosis?

Abstract: TCAR for the Treatment of Carotid StenosisTwo carotid revascularization strategies, CEA and TF-CAS, have been informed by high-quality randomized trials. In contrast, no randomized trial evidence exists regarding a newer procedural option, TCAR. The authors discuss these procedures and propose a randomized trial to inform the role of TCAR in the treatment of carotid stenosis.
