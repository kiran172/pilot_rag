Title: CT venography correlate of transverse sinus stenosis and venous transstenotic pressure gradient in unilateral pulsatile tinnitus patients with sigmoid sinus wall anomalies.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the correlation between transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) and transstenotic pressure gradient (TPG) in unilateral pulsatile tinnitus (PT) patients with sigmoid sinus wall anomalies (SSWA).
METHODS: Fifty-seven patients with unilateral venous PT were retrospectively included. All of them underwent CT venography and catheter manometry, accompanied with SSWA. The degree, length, shape (intrinsic/extrinsic/dysplasia), location (proximal/middle/distal, referring to the relative position of TSS and the Labbé vein junction) of TSS, the types of SSWA (dehiscence/diverticulum), and the degree of transverse sinus outflow laterality were assessed, and the correlations with ipsilesional TPG were analyzed.
RESULTS: The mean value of ipsilesional TPG was 7.61 ± 0.52 mmHg. The degree and length of ipsilesional TSS were positively correlated with TPG (p &lt; 0.001, p' &lt; 0.001), respectively. TPG was significantly larger in patients with contralateral transverse sinus dysplasia than those without (p = 0.023) and significantly smaller in patients with ipsilesional sigmoid sinus diverticulum than those with isolated dehiscence (p = 0.001). No statistical difference in TPG was shown between ipsilesional TSSs of different shapes or locations (p &gt; 0.05). No correlation was noted between the degree of ipsilesional transverse sinus outflow laterality and TPG (p = 0.051). Stepwise linear regression indicated that the degree (β = 9.207, 95% CI = 3.558-14.856), length (β = 0.122, 95% CI = 0.025-0.220) of ipsilesional TSS, and contralateral transverse sinus dysplasia (β = 1.875, 95% CI = 0.220-3.530) were significantly correlated with TPG (R2 = 0.471).
CONCLUSIONS: The degree, length of ipsilesional TSS, and contralateral transverse sinus dysplasia may be used to predict TPG in unilateral PT patients with SSWA.
KEY POINTS: • CT venography may act as a screening tool to help low-probability unilateral pulsatile tinnitus (PT) patients with sigmoid sinus wall anomalies (SSWA) avoid invasive catheter manometry. • The degree and length of ipsilesional transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) are positively correlated with transtenotic pressure gradient (TPG) in unilateral PT patients with SSWA. • Ipsilesional TPG is larger in unilateral PT patients with contralateral transverse sinus dysplasia than those without and is smaller in unilateral PT patients with sigmoid sinus diverticulum than those with isolated dehiscence.
