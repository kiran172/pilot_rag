Title: The origin of lumbar subcutaneous edema: two case reports.

Abstract: Since magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used to evaluate complaints of low back pain, there have been many reports of lumbar subcutaneous edema (LSE). However, the mechanism underlying its development is unknown. We herein report 2 cases that showed the reduction of LSE. These cases suggest details concerning the mechanism underlying the development of LSE. The first case was an obese 70-year-old woman with a history of chronic back pain due to lumbar canal stenosis. MRI revealed LSE extending from the level of the L2 vertebral body to the sacrum. However, LSE was reduced following weight loss due to a stomach ulcer. This case clearly indicated obesity as the cause of LSE. The second case was a nonobese 31-year-old woman with acute excruciating low back pain due to thoracolumbar fascia strain. LSE was observed at the level of the L3-L4 vertebral body. Two weeks later, her low back pain and LSE were reduced. This case suggests that the origin of LSE was impairment of the thoracolumbar fascia due to strain. We hypothesize that the mechanism underlying the development of LSE may be lymphatic or interstitial fluid pooling due to disturbance of the lumbar fascia.
