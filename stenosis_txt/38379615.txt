Title: Directional atherectomy for retained valves in a femoropopliteal saphenous vein bypass graft.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 62-year-old man presenting 2 months after a reversed great saphenous vein femoropopliteal bypass performed for critical limb ischemia. He was found to have early, high-grade bypass graft stenosis on duplex ultrasound. Subsequent angiography demonstrated flow limitations secondary to two areas of retained venous valves in the proximal and mid-portions of the vein graft. The culprit valve lesions were successfully lysed endovascularly with a HawkOne (Medtronic) directional atherectomy device. This case demonstrates a safe, novel use of a directional atherectomy device for treatment of remnant valves causing hemodynamically significant flow problems in peripheral vein grafts.
