Title: Efficacy and Safety of Non-Vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants Compared with Vitamin K Antagonists in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation and Type 2 Valvular Heart Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) compared with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and type 2 valvular heart disease (VHD).
METHODS: We searched the PubMed, LILACS, and MEDLINE databases to retrieve, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing NOACs and VKAs in patients with AF and type 2 VHD, excluding mitral stenosis (moderate to severe, of rheumatic origin) or mechanical heart valves. The efficacy outcomes assessed were stroke and systemic embolism (SE), while safety outcomes included major bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH).
RESULTS: Seven RCTs, including 16,070 patients with AF and type 2 VHD, were included. NOACs reduced the risk of stroke/SE (relative risk [RR], 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.89; P = 0.0005), with no significant difference in major bleeding (RR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.64-1.21; P = 0.43). The risk of ICH was reduced with NOACs (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.27-0.77; P = 0.003). For patients with AF and bioprosthetic heart valve (five trials, 2805 patients), stroke/SE risks (RR, 0.65, 95% CI, 0.44-0.96) with NOACs were superior to VKAs. Major bleeding risks without ENVISAGE TAVI AF trial (RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.30-0.94; P = 0.03) with NOACs were superior to VKAs. The risks of ICH (RR, 0.61; 95% CI 0.34-1.09; P = 0.09) with NOACs were comparable to VKAs.
CONCLUSIONS: NOACs demonstrate efficacy and safety in patients with AF and type 2 VHD and reduce the risk of stroke/SE and ICH when compared with those with VKAs.
