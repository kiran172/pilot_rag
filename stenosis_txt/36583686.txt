Title: Periostin increased by mechanical stress upregulates interleukin-6 expression in the ligamentum flavum.

Abstract: Ligamentum flavum (LF) hypertrophy is a major cause of lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Although mechanical stress is thought to be a major factor involved in LF hypertrophy, the exact mechanism by which it causes hypertrophy has not yet been fully elucidated. Here, changes in gene expression due to long-term mechanical stress were analyzed using RNA-seq in a rabbit LF hypertrophy model. In combination with previously reported analysis results, periostin was identified as a molecule whose expression fluctuates due to mechanical stress. The expression and function of periostin were further investigated using human LF tissues and primary LF cell cultures. Periostin was abundantly expressed in human hypertrophied LF tissues, and periostin gene expression was significantly correlated with LF thickness. In vitro, mechanical stress increased gene expressions of periostin, transforming growth factor-β1, α-smooth muscle actin, collagen type 1 alpha 1, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in LF cells. Periostin blockade suppressed the mechanical stress-induced gene expression of IL-6 while periostin treatment increased IL-6 gene expression. Our results suggest that periostin is upregulated by mechanical stress and promotes inflammation by upregulating IL-6 expression, which leads to LF degeneration and hypertrophy. Periostin may be a pivotal molecule for LF hypertrophy and a promising therapeutic target for lumbar spinal stenosis.
