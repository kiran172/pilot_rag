Title: Characteristics and Outcomes of Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Discussed by the Multidisciplinary "Heart Team" According to Treatment Allocation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an alternative and effective contemporary intervention to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for patients with severe aortic valve disease at increased surgical risk. Guidelines recommend a multidisciplinary "Heart Team" (MHT) review of patients considered for a TAVI procedure, but this has been little studied. We reviewed the characteristics, treatments and outcomes of such patients reviewed by the MHT at our centre.
METHODS: Data on consecutive patients with severe aortic valve stenosis discussed by the Auckland City Hospital MHT from June 2011 to August 2016 were obtained from clinical records. Patient characteristics, treatment and outcomes were analysed using standard statistical methods.
RESULTS: Over the 5-year period 243 patients (mean age 80.2 ± 8.0 years, 60% male) were presented at the MHT meeting. TAVI was recommended for 200, SAVR for 26 and medical therapy for 17 patients, with no significant difference in mean age (80.2 ± 8.3, 80.4 ± 6.1, 80.4 ± 7.3 years, respectively) or EuroSCORE II (6.5 ± 4.7%, 5.3 ± 3.6%, 6.7 ± 4.3%, respectively). Over time, there was an increase in the number of patients discussed and treated, with no change in their mean age, but the mean EuroSCORE II significantly decreased (TAVI p = 0.026, SAVR p = 0.004). Survival after TAVI and SAVR was similar to that of the age-matched general population, but superior to medical therapy p = 0.002 (93% (n = 162), 84% (n = 21) and 73% (n = 18) at one year and 85% (n = 149), 84% (n = 21) and 54% (n = 13) at 2 years, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: An increasing number of patients were discussed at the MHT meeting with the majority undergoing TAVI, with a similar age and EuroSCORE II to those allocated SAVR or medical therapy. Survival following TAVI and SAVR was superior to medical therapy and similar to the age-matched general population. These findings suggest that the MHT process is robust, consistent and appropriately allocating a limited treatment resource.
