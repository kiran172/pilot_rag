Title: Protective mechanism of SIRT1 on Hcy-induced atrial fibrosis mediated by TRPC3.

Abstract: High plasma levels of homocysteine (Hcy) are regarded as a risk factor for atrial fibrillation (AF), which is closely associated with the pathological consequence of atrial fibrosis and can lead to heart failure with a high mortality rate; here, we show that atrial fibrosis is mediated by the relationship between canonical transient receptor potential 3 (TRPC3) channels and sirtuin type 1 (SIRT1) under the stimulation of Hcy. The left atrial appendage was obtained from patients with either sinus rhythm (SR) or AF and used to evaluate the relationship between the concentration of Hcy and a potential mechanism of cardiac fibrosis mediated by TRPC3 and SIRT1. We next performed transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mouse to investigate the relationship. The mechanisms underlying atrial fibrosis involving TRPC3 and SIRT1 proteins were explored by co-IP, BLI and lentivirus transfection experiments. qPCR and WB were performed to analyse gene and protein expression, respectively. The higher level of atrial fibrosis was observed in the HH mouse group with a high Hcy diet. Such results suggest that AF patients may be more susceptible to atrial fibrosis and possess a high probability of progressing to hyperhomocysteinemia. Moreover, our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that TRPC3 channel up-regulation leads to abnormal accumulation of collagen, with the down-regulation of SIRT1 as an aetiological factor of high Hcy, which in turn predisposes to atrial fibrosis and strongly enhances the possibility of AF.
