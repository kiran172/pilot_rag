Title: Review of imaging and endovascular intervention of iliocaval venous compression syndrome.

Abstract: Iliocaval venous compression syndrome (ICS) is the extrinsic compression of the common iliac vein by the overlying iliac artery against the vertebra. Chronic compression can lead to venous stenosis and stasis, which manifests as chronic venous disease and treatment resistance. Therefore, early recognition of ICS and prompt treatment are essential. Clinical presentations of ICS can be ambiguous and diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion with the relevant imaging studies. The initial imaging test is typically a Duplex ultrasound for vessel assessment and pelvic ultrasound to exclude a compressive mass, which is followed by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) venography. CT and MRI can identify the anatomical causes for venous compression. In patients with high clinical suspicion for ICS, negative findings on CT and MR venography would still warrant further investigations. Definitive diagnosis can be established using catheter-based venography complemented with intravascular ultrasonography but the nature of their invasiveness limits its utility as a routine imaging modality. In this review paper, we will discuss the evidence, utility and limitations of the existing imaging modalities and endovascular intervention used in the management of ICS.
