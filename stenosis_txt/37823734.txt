Title: Resection of a cardiac tumour with reconstruction of the atria and the superior vena cava.

Abstract: Cardiac tumours are very rare and their complete resection, when feasible, remains the only curative treatment. We present the case of a patient who had aortic stenosis. The routine preoperative workup also identified stenosis in the left anterior descending and right coronary arteries, and most importantly, an invasive tumour at the confluence of the superior vena cava-right atrium-left atrium. After discussion by the heart team, and as is usually done in our department for non-complex right coronary lesions, the stenosis was treated by inserting a stent. The patient was operated on for an aortic valve replacement with a concomitant left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery coronary artery bypass graft. In addition, the tumour was completely resected surgically. Reconstruction included a patch for the left atrium, another for the right atrium and a Dacron tube for the superior vena cava. Histological analysis confirmed the complete resection of a cardiac hibernoma. Three months after the surgery, the patient is doing well without any symptoms.
