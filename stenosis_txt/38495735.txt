Title: Role of interventional bronchoscopy and chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with small-cell lung cancer: A case report.

Abstract: Most of the small-cell lung cancer patients are of the central type of lung cancer. Small-cell lung cancer often intrudes into the atmospheric tract and large blood vessels, thus causing severe tracheobronchial stenosis and superior vena cava syndrome. In addition, patients with malignant tumors, especially those with respiratory failure and severe hypoxia, can be complicated with thromboembolic diseases. We reported a 65-year-old woman with severe stenosis of the trachea, and right main bronchus complicated with acute respiratory failure was treated with bronchoscopy and stent implantation to improve the patient's dyspnea, thus successfully receiving chemotherapy and timely treatment. After chemotherapy, the tumor shrank and the stenosis of the trachea and right main bronchus improved. We removed the right main bronchus stent and the tracheal stent successively to improve the quality of life of the patients. We managed both the cancer and exacerbation-related factors to improve the patient's medical conditions so that the patient could receive timely and suitable treatment.
