Title: Pancreatic Carcinoma Causing Schnitzler's Metastasis.

Abstract: Schnitzler's metastasis occurs due to the deposition of the tumor cells in the submucosa of the rectum, leading to rectal stenosis. We present a 60-year-old female who presented with abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting. Abdominal examination showed a distended abdomen and palpable bowel loops, and per rectal examination showed rectal stenosis. Imaging studies suggest rectal stenosis with carcinoma of the pancreas head. The patient was diagnosed with Schnitzler's metastasis with carcinoma of the pancreas head, which has not been reported in the literature. The patient underwent a diversion sigmoid colostomy and was planned for palliative chemotherapy after stenting the common bile duct.
