Title: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical outcomes of TAVI versus SAVR in the octogenarian population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) has shown safe, robust results in elderly populations, and up until recently, was the gold standard for management of severe aortic stenosis. The approach to severe aortic stenosis in high-risk populations, such as octogenarians, has been challenged with the development of transcatheter-based strategies. We sought to systematically analyse outcomes between surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVI) in octogenarians.
METHOD: Electronic databases were searched from their inception until November 2018 for studies comparing SAVR to TAVI in octogenarians, according to a predefined search criterion. The primary end point was mortality, and secondary end points included post-procedural complications.
RESULTS: The review yielded four observational studies. The total number of patients included was 1221 including 395 who underwent TAVI and 826 SAVR. On average, patients from both subgroups carried a high number of cardiac risk factors, and STS-PROM scoring yielded mean values equating to high-risk population groups, with significantly higher values for TAVI patients across the board. The presence of post-procedural moderate aortic regurgitation was noted only in the TAVI population (OR = 8.88; 95% CI (1.47-53.64), χ2 = 1.22; p = 0.02; I 2 = 0%). Otherwise, there were no significant differences when accounting for mortality (OR = 0.68; 95% CI (0.44-1.05), χ2 = 1.88; p = 0.60; I 2 = 0%), permanent pacemaker implantation groups (OR = 0.45; 95% CI (0.44-1.49), χ2 = 0.11; p = 0.19; I 2 = 0%), and neurological events (OR = 0.72; 95% CI (0.42-1.23), χ2 = 2.57; p = 0.23; I 2 = 22%).
DISCUSSION: The analysed data on TAVI versus SAVR in the octogenarian population show that TAVI shows similar outcomes with relation to mortality and inpatient admission times, in a population with significantly higher risk profiles than their SAVR counterparts. TAVI has higher occurrences of post-procedural AR. TAVI still does not have robust long-term data to ensure its efficacy and rate of complications, but is showing promising results nonetheless.
