Title: Rare Case of Coincident Quadricuspid Pulmonic Valve and Suprapulmonic Ridge: Multimodality Imaging.

Abstract: A 32-year-old woman with a history of mild congenital pulmonic stenosis presented with new dyspnea on exertion. Multimodal imaging revealed a quadricuspid pulmonic valve with supravalvular ridge. We illustrate the evaluation and diagnosis of this rare condition. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
