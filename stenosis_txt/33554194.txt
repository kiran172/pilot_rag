Title: Balloon Laryngoplasty for Pediatric Subglottic Stenosis: A 5-year Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to present our experience and evaluate our results of endoscopic balloon laryngoplasty (BL) in children with subglottic stenosis (SGS) at a pediatric tertiary center over a 5-year period.
METHODS: This study reviewed 41 pediatric patients diagnosed with acquired SGS who had undergone BL as the primary course of treatment. Cases were analyzed for details including patient demographics, SGS grade and length, timing and the type of surgery, presence of tracheostomy, comorbidities, postoperative management, complications and outcomes of balloon dilatation.
RESULTS: Forty-one children (22 girls and 19 boys) who had undergone BL at a mean age of 26 months (range, 1 month to 14 years) were included in the study. Nineteen (46.3%) were diagnosed with acute SGS (12 thin stenosis, 7 thick stenosis) and 22 (53.7%) with chronic SGS (9 thin stenosis, 13 thick stenosis). The success rate of BL was 100% in patients with acute and chronic thin membranous stenosis. The effectiveness of BL was significantly higher in patients with acute thick stenosis than in patients with chronic thick stenosis (p=0.016).
CONCLUSION: This study confirms that BL in patients presenting with acquired SGS with thin membranous stenosis, regardless of whether acute or chronic, can have a good prognosis. However, the results are less promising in cases of chronic thick stenosis.
