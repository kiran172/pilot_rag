Title: [Analysis on clinical features of patients with ulcerative colitis associated colorectal cancer].

Abstract: Objective: To analyze the clinical features of ulcerative colitis associated colorectal cancer (UC-CRC). Methods: A total of 869 inpatients with Ulcerative Colitis (UC) in Peking Union Medical Hospital from January 1998 to January 2018 were continuously enrolled. Clinical data and the outcome of colorectal cancer (CRC) were collected via medical records and telephone follow-up. Chi-square test and logistic regression model were used to analyze the data. Results: There were 16 patients in 869 UC inpatients who were diagnosed with CRC during a period of 7 548 person years and the incidence rate of UC-CRC was 1.84%. Compared to UC inpatients without CRC, a longer course of disease (OR=1.087, 95% CI:1.046-1.129) , a lower usage rate of 5-Aminosalicylic Acid(5-ASA) (OR=0.218, 95% CI:0.052-0.915) and a higher incidence rate of intestinal stenosis (OR=16.533, 95% CI:3.824-71.478) were found in UC inpatients with CRC. Conclusions: A long disease course is a risk factor for UC patients developing CRC, while 5-ASA therapy can reduce the risk of suffering from CRC. For UC patients with intestinal stenosis, CRC should be warned for occurring.
