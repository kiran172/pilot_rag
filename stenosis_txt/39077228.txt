Title: Anesthetic Management of a 24-Year-Old Male With Tracheal Stenosis Planned for Tracheal Resection and Anastomosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Tracheal resection and anastomosis are among the most challenging surgeries. Advancements in this field have made a variety of surgical, anesthetic, and airway management options possible. This procedure calls for multidisciplinary preoperative planning and close communication during surgery and recovery. Here, we present a case of a 24-year-old male who developed post-intubation tracheal stenosis. Repeated bronchoscopic dilatations were done for the same, but the symptoms persisted. Hence, the patient was planned for tracheal resection and anastomosis, the definitive surgical management. In this case report, we have discussed the anesthetic management of the same.
