Title: Elements of Immunoglobulin E Network Associate with Aortic valve Area in Patients with Acquired Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Allergic mechanisms are likely involved in atherosclerosis and its clinical presentations, such as coronary artery disease (CAD). It has been previously reported that CAD severity associates with serum levels of immunoglobulin E (IgE), the molecule that, along with its high-affinity receptor (FcԑRI), plays a central role in allergic reactions. Considering multiple pathophysiological similarities between atherosclerosis and acquired aortic (valve) stenosis (AS), we speculated that allergic pathways could also contribute to the AS mechanisms and grading. To validate this hypothesis, we first checked whether total serum IgE levels associate with echocardiographic markers of AS severity. Having found a positive correlation between serum IgE and aortic valve area (AVA), we further speculated that also total IgE-determining genetic polymorphisms in FCER1A, a locus encoding an allergen-biding FcԑRI subunit, are related to acquired AS severity. Indeed, the major allele of rs2251746 polymorphism, known to associate with higher IgE levels, turned out to correlate with larger AVA, a marker of less severe AS. Our findings surprisingly suggest a protective role of IgE pathways against AS progression. IgE-mediated protective mechanisms in AS require further investigations.
