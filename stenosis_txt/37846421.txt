Title: Gastroenteric-anastomosis in the setting of marked stomach dilatation associated with gastric pyloric obstruction secondary to Sarcina ventriculi.

Abstract: Sarcina ventriculi is an anaerobic gram-positive bacterium capable of surviving in the acidic environment of the stomach and causing gastrointestinal symptoms. We report the case of a 51-year-old patient with no notable medical history who presented with abdominal distension, nausea, and vomiting. Initial endoscopic evaluation revealed a distended stomach in stasis with pyloric stenosis. Biopsies revealed the presence of Helicobacter pylori and S. ventriculi. A therapeutic protocol was administered, but no symptomatic relief was observed. Subsequently, the patient was referred to our institution, where computed tomography imaging of the abdomen was performed. The results corroborated a presentation suggestive of a high obstruction attributable to a right anterior para-duodenal internal hernia. Ultimately, surgery was undertaken, ruling out the diagnosis of right para-duodenal internal hernia and resulting in gastroenteric anastomosis with satisfactory improvement in clinical symptoms.
