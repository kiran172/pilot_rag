Title: Can Moyamoya Disease Susceptibility Gene Affect Extracranial Systemic Artery Stenosis?

Abstract: Diseases associated with the RNF213 gene include moyamoya disease, with the p.R4810K (c.14429G>A, rs112735431) homozygous variant thought to be the most pathogenic and significantly associated with severe manifestation such as early onset or cerebral infarction at onset. We report a case of a unique Japanese pedigree associated with RNF213. A 53-year-old woman with no arteriosclerotic risk factors experienced coronary artery disease, followed by coronary artery bypass surgery. In 8 years, she suffered sudden abdominal pain. Her abdominal contrast computed tomography revealed stenosis of abdominal artery and superior mesenteric artery. Though her 2 children and uncle had a typical moyamoya disease with RNF213 p.R4810K heterozygous variant, she has had no clinical and radiological evidence of moyamoya disease. Due to a family history of moyamoya disease, a genetic investigation was performed and revealed RNF213 p.R4810K homozygous variant. A possible role of RNF213 influencing systemic artery stenosis can be further be understood from this rare case harboring the homozygous variant carrier.
