Title: Focusing on the Native Matrix Proteins in Calcific Aortic Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a widespread valvular heart disease affecting people in aging societies, primarily characterized by fibrosis, inflammation, and progressive calcification, leading to valve orifice stenosis. Understanding the factors associated with CAVS onset and progression is crucial to develop effective future pharmaceutical therapies. In CAVS, native extracellular matrix proteins modifications, play a significant role in calcification in vitro and in vivo. This work aimed to review the evidence on the alterations of structural native extracellular matrix proteins involved in calcification development during CAVS and highlight its link to deregulated biomechanical function.
