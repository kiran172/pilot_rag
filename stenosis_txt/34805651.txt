Title: A novel endovascular treatment for transcatheter aortic valve embolization.

Abstract: In the present report, we have described the case of an 82-year-old obese man who had required transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. During implantation, the balloon-mounted valve became dislodged and embolized to the ascending aorta. A second valve was successfully implanted after several failed attempts to reposition the first one into the aortic annulus. The dislodged valve became further embolized and landed in the distal descending aorta, partially obstructing the splanchnic, renal, and lower extremity blood flow. It was rotated with flexible forceps and permanently secured in the distal thoracic aorta using a thoracic endoprosthesis, rendering it harmless.
