Title: A one-stage method for external auditory canal reconstruction; the Wessex pre-auricular flap.

Abstract: This technique has been developed with the aim of expanding the well documented pre-auricular flap to help reconstruct pinna lesions that extend into the external auditory canal. This area can be a challenge to reconstruct effectively to minimise morbidity and there are limited published techniques. This flap is a reproducible, one-stage technique that is readily available to most ENT surgeons, avoiding stenosis and allowing for adequate reconstruction of the external auditory canal.
