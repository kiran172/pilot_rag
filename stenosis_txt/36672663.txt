Title: TGF-β1 and TGFβR2 Gene Polymorphisms in Patients with Unstable Angina.

Abstract: Acute coronary syndromes result from a sudden reduction in the lumen of a coronary artery as a result of atherosclerotic plaque rupture, its swelling or the formation of thrombotic lesions. Many mediators with inflammatory, prothrombotic and proatherogenic effects have been shown to be involved, including numerous cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and growth factors. TGF-β1 is a pleiotropic cytokine found in various cells that regulates cell growth, differentiation and matrix production. The aim of our study was to assess the association between polymorphisms in the TGF-β1 gene (rs1800469, rs1800470) and polymorphisms in the TGFBR2 receptor gene (rs6785358, rs9838682) and the risk of unstable angina, as well as selected clinical parameters affecting the risk of ischemic heart disease. The study included 232 patients with unstable angina. The diagnosis of unstable angina was made by typical clinical presentation and confirmation of significant coronary artery lumen stenosis (>70%) during coronary angiography. There were no statistically significant differences in the distribution of TGFBR2 rs6785358 and rs9838682 genotypes and haplotypes between patients with unstable angina and control subjects. We observed increased values of plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels, as well as triglycerides, in patients with the TGFBR2 rs9838682 AA genotype. In patients with the TGFBR2 rs6785358 AA genotype, we noted increased BMI values. There were no statistically significant associations between other studied polymorphisms and clinical parameters. Polymorphisms in the TGF-β1 gene (rs1800469, rs1800470) and polymorphisms in the TGFBR2 receptor gene (rs6785358, rs9838682) are not significant risk factors for unstable angina in our population. The TGFBR2 gene rs9838682 polymorphism may influence the lipid parameters in patients with coronary artery disease.
