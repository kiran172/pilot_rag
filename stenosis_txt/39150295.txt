Title: Long-term comparison of rotational and directional atherectomy outcomes in patients with femoropopliteal lesions.

Abstract: Objective: This study aims to elucidate the differences in vessel patency rates, procedural complications, and the need for repeat interventions between these two techniques, thereby providing insights into the optimal atherectomy strategy for managing peripheral arterial disease in the femoropopliteal segment. Material and Methods: This retrospective study investigated the long-term effectiveness of two atherectomy techniques, rotational atherectomy (RA) and directional atherectomy (DA), in treating lower extremity peripheral artery disease (LE-PAD) affecting the superficial femoral artery (SFA) and popliteal arteries. A total of 134 patients with symptomatic LE-PAD and significant stenosis (70%-99%) were included and divided into two groups based on the atherectomy method used. Both groups underwent similar pre- and post-atherectomy procedures, including drug-coated balloon angioplasty. The primary outcome measure was clinical success, defined as procedural success and an improvement in Rutherford classification at 1Â year. Results: Baseline characteristics were similar between the two groups, with no significant differences in demographics or lesion characteristics, except for a higher proportion of right-sided lesions in the DA group. While both RA and DA effectively improved ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford classification at 12 months, RA demonstrated superior long-term benefits, with significantly higher ABI at 24 months and a greater proportion of asymptomatic patients. Although RA had a longer procedural duration and a higher incidence of dissection, it resulted in lower residual stenosis and fewer cases of treated segment thrombosis than DA. Both RA and DA are effective treatment options for femoropopliteal lesions, but RA may offer advantages in long-term symptom management and vessel patency. Conclusion: Both rotational and directional atherectomy effectively treat femoropopliteal lesions, with rotational atherectomy demonstrating superior long-term outcomes in terms of symptom management and vessel patency. Despite longer procedural times and a slightly higher risk of dissection, rotational atherectomy resulted in lower residual stenosis and fewer cases of treated segment thrombosis than directional atherectomy.
