Title: Predictors and Prognostic Implications of Myocardial Injury After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Myocardial injury (MI) is not unusual after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). To determine precipitating factors and prognostic outcomes of MI after TAVR, we retrospectively investigated relationships between MI after TAVR and aortic root dimensions, baseline patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and procedural features. Of 474 patients who underwent transfemoral TAVR for severe aortic stenosis in our tertiary center from June 2011 through June 2018, 188 (mean age, 77.7 Â± 7.7 yr; 96 women [51%]) met the study inclusion criteria. Patients were divided into postprocedural MI (PMI) (n=74) and no-PMI (n=114) groups, in accordance with high-sensitivity troponin T levels. We found that MI risk was associated with older age (odds ratio [OR]=1.054; 95% CI, 1.013-1.098; P=0.01), transcatheter heart valve type (OR=10.207; 95% CI, 2.861-36.463; P=0.001), distances from the aortic annulus to the right coronary artery ostium (OR=0.853; 95% CI, 0.731-0.995; P=0.04) and the left main coronary artery ostium (OR=0.747; 95% CI, 0.616-0.906; P=0.003), and baseline glomerular filtration rate (OR=0.985; 95% CI, 0.970-1.000; P=0.04). Moreover, the PMI group had a longer time to hospital discharge (P=0.001) and a higher permanent pacemaker implantation rate (P=0.04) than did the no-PMI group. Our findings may enable better estimation of which patients are at higher risk of MI after TAVR and thus improve the planning and course of clinical care.
