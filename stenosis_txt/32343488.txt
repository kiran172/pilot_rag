Title: Tripartite motif 10 regulates cardiac hypertrophy by targeting the PTEN/AKT pathway.

Abstract: The pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy is tightly associated with activation of intracellular hypertrophic signalling pathways, which leads to the synthesis of various proteins. Tripartite motif 10 (TRIM10) is an E3 ligase with important functions in protein quality control. However, its role in cardiac hypertrophy was unclear. In this study, neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) and TRIM10-knockout mice were subjected to phenylephrine (PE) stimulation or transverse aortic constriction (TAC) to induce cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Trim10 expression was significantly increased in hypertrophied murine hearts and PE-stimulated NRCMs. Knockdown of TRIM10 in NRCMs alleviated PE-induced changes in the size of cardiomyocytes and hypertrophy gene expression, whereas TRIM10 overexpression aggravated these changes. These results were further verified in TRIM10-knockout mice. Mechanistically, we found that TRIM10 knockout or knockdown decreased AKT phosphorylation. Furthermore, we found that TRIM10 knockout or knockdown increased ubiquitination of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which negatively regulated AKT activation. The results of this study reveal the involvement of TRIM10 in pathological cardiac hypertrophy, which may occur by prompting of PTEN ubiquitination and subsequent activation of AKT signalling. Therefore, TRIM10 may be a promising target for treatment of cardiac hypertrophy.
