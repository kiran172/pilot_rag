Title: Utility of Follow-Up Echocardiograms in Uncomplicated PDA Device Closures Performed During Infancy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Guidelines recommend lifelong follow-up with transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) for patients who had a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) device closure via catheterization. The goal of this study was to determine the utility of follow-up TTE in patients who underwent an uncomplicated PDA device closure during infancy.
METHODS: Chart review was performed on patients who had a PDA closure at not more than 1 year of age between January 1, 2002 and June 1, 2020. Patients were excluded if they had other congenital heart disease, did not have a follow-up TTE at least 3 months after procedure, or had a velocity greater than 2.0 m/s in the left pulmonary artery (LPA) or descending aorta (DAo) on the first TTE at least 3 months after device placement. Time points included the first TTE after the procedure, first TTE at least 3 months after procedure, and the most recent TTE.
RESULTS: Total of 147 infants met the inclusion criteria. Age and weight at initial procedure were 141 ± 217 days and 4.2 ± 2.8 kg. There was no significant difference in DAo velocity between initial and most recent TTE. LPA velocity and left ventricular diastolic Z score significantly decreased between initial and most recent TTE. Seventy-eight patients had repeat echocardiograms more than 1 year after PDA procedure with no change in clinical management. No patient underwent an intervention on the LPA or DAo for stenosis.
CONCLUSION: In patients who underwent an uncomplicated PDA closure during infancy, TTE parameters either stayed stable or improved over time. These findings need to be corroborated in larger studies with longer follow-up. If verified, the long-term TTE guidelines may need to be simplified for this patient population.
