Title: Minimally invasive versus abdominal radical trachelectomy for early-stage cervical cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: The safety of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) for cervical cancer has been questioned. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with cervical cancer who underwent MIS and abdominal trachelectomy. We searched for and subsequently analyzed studies published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Clinical Trials.gov from their inception until April 10, 2023. Six studies with 1,079 participants were included, constituting 512 and 567 patients in the MIS and abdominal surgery groups, respectively. No significant difference was observed in the overall survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.16-1.65; I2=0.0%; P=0.881), recurrence rate (RR, 1.26; 95% CI, 0.68-2.33; I2=0.0%; P=0.815), and death rate (RR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.23-1.31; I2=0.0%; P=0.680) between the MIS and abdominal surgery groups. No significant difference was found in urinary tract complication (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.28-2.17; I2=0.0%; P=0.603), cerclage erosion (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.34-2.43; I2=0.0%; P=0.650), or cervical stenosis (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.22-2.18; I2=0.0%; P=0.885) between both groups. However, significant differences in blood loss and length of hospital stay were observed between both groups. Among 49 females who attempted to get pregnant, 31.3% (5/16) and 51.5% (17/33) in the MIS and abdominal surgery groups, respectively, succeeded in conceiving. We established that laparoscopic and abdominal radical trachelectomy had similar efficacies for treating patients with early cervical cancer, with no significant differences in survival, tumor recurrence, and mortality rates. Additionally, they showed no significant differences in pregnancy-related outcomes. However, owing to the limited number of studies, more high-quality cohort studies are required to confirm these findings.
