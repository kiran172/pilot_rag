Title: [Prognostic factors for successful outcome in sialendoscopy for sialolithiasis].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The success of sialendoscopy depends on several factors. The 2008 introduced lithiasis-stenosis-dilatation (LSD) classification intended to describe more precise the stone-duct system. We investigated whether the LSD classification and additional pre- and intraoperative parameters could be used as prognostic factors for success.
METHODS: We retrospectively assessed patients with primary sialendoscopy for sialolithiasis between September 2018 und March 2020. Among others, the outcome variables were the stone size, location and LSD classification.
RESULTS: We included 37 patients. The success group included 12/37 (32 %) patients. The median stone size was 3.7 millimeters (mm) in the success group and 10.0 mm in the failure group (Mann-Whitney test; p < 0.0001). In the success group, 11/12 stones were distal in contrast to the failure group (13/25 stones proximal; Pearson's chi-square test; p = 0.010). We noted 10 L1S0D0 stones in the success group in contrast to the failure group (15 L3aS0D0 stones; Pearson chi-square test; p = 0.001). For distal stones smaller than 5 mm, the success rate was 100 % and for proximal stones larger than 4 mm, it was 0 %. For stones free in the duct lumen (L1S0D0), the success rate was 60-100 %.
CONCLUSION: The distal stone location and the smaller stone size in a normal duct should be beneficial prognostic factors for success. Future studies should focus on the LSD classification, stone volume, stone duct orientation and stone distance from the papilla.
