Title: [Posterior Lumbar Decompression:Variations and Pitfalls].

Abstract: Lumbar canal stenosis is the most common pathological condition causing spinal degeneration. Symptomatic patients who fail conservative treatment are considered candidates for surgical treatment. Many types of minimally invasive procedures for lumbar decompression have been proposed, most of which are effective and have shown good long-term results. However, in special cases, a second operation may be needed for spondylolisthesis caused by degeneration of the same segment. Two major minimally invasive approaches are available for bilateral decompression of lumbar canal stenosis: unilateral approach and midline approach. The unilateral approach is used to preserve midline structures, the contralateral facet joint, and the contralateral paravertebral muscle. The midline approach is used to preserve the left and right facet joints and the enthesis of the paravertebral muscle. These two approaches are suitable for specific situations based on their own concepts. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the advantages and disadvantages of each procedure. In this article, the varieties of lumbar decompressive methods and the pitfalls of decompression procedures will be discussed.
