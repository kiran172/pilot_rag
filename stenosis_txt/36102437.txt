Title: LIVER TRANSPLANTATION IN HIV PATIENTS: A CASE SERIES FROM THE NORTHEAST REGION OF BRAZIL.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The emergence of potent combined highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) in 1996 changed the natural history of HIV infection, with a significant reduction in mortality due to opportunistic infections but increased morbidity due to chronic cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. In May 2016, a reference center for liver transplantation in the Northeast of Brazil performed the first liver transplantations (LT) in HIV patients, with five others until 2021.
METHODS: The criteria for selection of LT were good adherence and absence of resistance to ART, HIV viral load maximum suppression, T-CD4+ lymphocyte count of more than 100 cells/mm3, and absence of opportunistic infections in the last 6 months.
RESULTS: Six liver transplants were performed between May 2016 and May 2021, five men, with a mean age of 53.2 years, and one was a diabetic patient. All patients had access to grafts with short cold ischemia with a mean time of 5 hours and 39 minutes. The 4-month survival rate was 100%, with a range time of follow-up of 4-63 months (mean time of 31 months). The mean pre-transplant T-CD4+ lymphocyte count was 436 cells/mm3. The mean length of hospital stay after transplantation was 16.8 days. One patient presented precocious vena cava thrombosis; another had stenosis of cavocaval anastomosis leading to refractory ascites, renal failure and post-transplant graft dysfunction, and another presented stenosis of choledochal anastomosis. Immunosuppression and prophylaxis were used according to standard protocols, and there were no differences in the profile of infections or rejection after liver transplantation.
CONCLUSION: This case series documents good survival and usual transplant procedures for confirmed HIV cases.
