Title: [A Case of Pyloric Stenosis Due to Gastric Metastasis of Breast Cancer].

Abstract: We report a case of left advanced breast cancer(T4N1M0, Stage ⅢA)in a 67-year-old woman. In August 2010, her breast cancer(triple-negative invasive ductal carcinoma)was resected(mastectomy plus axillary lymph node dissection) with adjuvant chemotherapy(TC)and irradiation to her chest wall. In July 2018, she experienced recurrent vomiting. Gastrointestinal endoscopy(GS)revealed type Ⅳ advanced gastric cancer-like appearance with pyloric stenosis. Pathological findings confirmed hormone-positive gastric metastasis of breast cancer. Systemic chemo-endocrine therapy(EC and anastrozole) was performed, following which her symptoms improved. In May 2019, recurrent vomiting appeared again. Thereafter, systemic chemo-endocrine therapy(paclitaxel plus bevacizumab and fulvestrant)was initiated, and her symptoms showed improvement. In November 2020, she showed obstructive jaundice due to malignant biliary stenosis. She was treated using endoscopic biliary stenting, but died 2 months later. Gastric metastasis is reported rarely in 4% of all breast cancers, and GS should be recommended in cases of recurrent abdominal complaints.
