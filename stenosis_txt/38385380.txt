Title: Interventional Management of Portal Vein Stenosis after Liver Transplant: Single Center Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Portal vein stenosis is a relatively rare complication after liver transplant but has severe consequences. We evaluated the efficacy and longterm results of the endovascular treatment methods for portal vein stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2011 to October 2022, we treated 22 patients (5 female, 17 male) with portal vein stenosis using endovascular methods. Doppler ultrasonography was used for initial diagnosis, with consideration of flow rate increase over stenosis, absence of flow, or reduced anastomotic segment size (>50%). Angiography served as the gold standard, with a pressure gradient above 5 mm Hg indicating the need for treatment. Technical success criteria were defined as <50% stenosis remaining and/or a pressure gradient <5mm Hg. The transhepatic approach was used for all patients. Balloon angioplasty was initially performed, and stents were reserved for patients in the early postoperative period or those unresponsive to balloon angioplasty.
RESULTS: The technical success rate was 100%. Mean age was 27.1 years (SD 22.4; range, 4 months to 63 years). Mean time from transplant to intervention was 317 days (range, 0-3135 days). Angioplasty was successful for 7 patients (13.8%). Of 15 patients who underwent stent placement, 9 (40.9%) were in the early postoperative period; in the other 6 patients (27%), results of angioplasty were not satisfactory, and stents were placed. Within 3 months of transplant, 3 patients died because of other complications. Among patients with stents, 2 required reintervention, resulting in reestablishment of good portal venous flow. During the mean follow-up of 24 months (range, 15 days to 9 years), 19 patients (86%) had portal flows within reference limits.
CONCLUSIONS: The endovascular approach is a safe and effective treatment option for management of portal vein stenosis in both adult and pediatric liver transplant recipients in the early or late period.
