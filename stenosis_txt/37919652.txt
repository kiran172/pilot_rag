Title: Postoperative outcomes, predictors and trends of mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery with underlying aortic stenosis: a nationwide inpatient sample analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hip fractures frequently necessitate hospitalization, especially among patients aged 75 and above who might concurrently suffer from aortic stenosis (AS). This study focuses on postoperative outcomes, potential determinants of morbidity and mortality, as well as evolving trends in patients with AS undergoing surgical repair of hip fractures.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the Nationwide Inpatient Sample from 2008 to 2019 was conducted. Hip fracture cases were identified, and a subgroup with AS was isolated using the ICD-9 and ICD-10 diagnostic codes. We compared baseline characteristics, postoperative in-hospital outcomes and trends in mortality and morbidity between patients with and without AS.
RESULTS: From the dataset, 2,834,919 patients with hip fracture were identified on weighted analysis. Of these, 94,270 (3.3%) were found to have concurrent AS. The AS cohort was characterized by higher mean age and elevated burden of cardiovascular comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, pulmonary hypertension, congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias. Postoperative mortality following hip fracture surgery was greater in the AS groups compared to non-AS group (3.3% vs 1.57%, p < 0.001). Risk factors such as congestive heart failure (OR, 2.3[CI, 2.1-2.6]), age above 85 years (OR, 3.2[CI, 2.2-4.7]), cardiac arrhythmias (OR, 2.4[CI, 2.2-2.6]), end-stage renal disease (OR, 3.4[CI, 2.7-4.1]), malnutrition (OR, 2.3[CI, 2.1-2.7]) and AS (OR, 1.2[CI, 1.08-1.5] were associated with increased adjusted odds of postoperative mortality. AS was linked to higher adjusted odds of postoperative mortality (OR, 1.2 [CI, 1.1-1.5]) and complications such as acute myocardial infarction (OR, 1.2 [CI, 1.01-1.4]), cardiogenic shock (OR, 2.0[CI, 1.4-2.9]) and acute renal failure (OR, 1.1[CI, 1.02-1.2]). While hospital stay duration was comparable in both groups (average 5 days), the AS group incurred higher costs (mean $50,673 vs $44,607). The presence of acute heart failure in patients with AS and hip fracture significantly increased mortality, hospital stay, and cost. A notable decline in postoperative in-hospital mortality was observed in both groups from 2008-2019 though the rate of major in-hospital complications rose.
CONCLUSION: AS significantly influences postoperative in-hospital mortality and complication rates in hip fracture patients. While a reduction in postoperative mortality was observed in both AS and non-AS cohorts, the incidence of major in-hospital complications increased across both groups.
