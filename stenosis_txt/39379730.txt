Title: Intravenous indocyanine green to evaluate distal ureteral vascularity during robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the present study is to assess the role of indocyanine green (ICG) to evaluate distal ureteral vascularity during robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with intracorporeal urinary diversion and its impact on the incidence of benign ureteroenteric strictures (UES).
METHODS: The study included patients who underwent RARC for bladder cancer between 2018 and 2023. All patients included underwent intracorporeal urinary diversion with ileal conduit or neobladder. Bricker technique was performed in all ureteroenteric anastomosis. ICG was employed during the study period to evaluate ureteral vascularity. We divided patients into 2 groups depending on the utilization of ICG during surgery and compared demographic, clinicopathological and perioperative outcomes, including benign UES rates.
RESULTS: We identified 221 patients that underwent RARC with intracorporeal urinary diversion. Ileal conduit was performed in 173 (78.3%) patients and neobladder in 48 (21.7%) cases. A total of 142 (64.3%) and 79 (35.7%) patients were in the non-ICG and ICG group, respectively. With a median follow-up of the entire cohort of 21.1 months, there were no differences in the rate of benign UES after RARC between the non-ICG and the ICG group (p = 0.901). In the non-ICG group, 26 (18.3%) patients developed benign UES and in the ICG group 15 (19.0%) patients. Most of the strictures appeared in the left ureter in both groups (80.8% non-ICG vs. 66.7% ICG, p = 0.599). Median time to stricture diagnosis was 4 months (IQR 3-7.25) for the non-ICG and 3 months (IQR 2-5) for the ICG group (p = 0.091). The ICG group had a slightly greater length of ureter resected compared with the non-ICG group (1.5 vs. 1.3 cm, p = 0.007).
CONCLUSION: In our experience, choosing to use ICG intraoperatively to evaluate distal ureteral vascularity may not reduce the rate of benign UES after robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal urinary diversion and Bricker ureteroileal anastomosis.
