Title: What should otolaryngologists know about dural venous sinus stenting?

Abstract: Dural venous sinus stenting is an emerging and exciting area in otolaryngology in collaboration with neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists. The first cases were reported 20 years ago. It is now considered part of the routine treatment of increased intracranial pressure due to transverse sinus stenosis. ENT doctors are the first to see these patients in their clinics, as sinus headaches, pulsating tinnitus, and dizziness are the most common symptoms. Previously, with limited success, high-dose diuretics and intracranial shunts had been the only options for treating these patients. Other methods, such as covering the sigmoid sinuses with graft material, appear to cause a sudden increase in intracranial pressure that can lead to blindness and even death. This overview summarizes the clinical and imaging characteristics of patients who will benefit from endovascular sinus stenting for elevated intracranial pressure.
