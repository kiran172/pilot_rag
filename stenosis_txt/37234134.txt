Title: Diagnostic Dilemma: A Patient With Pulmonary Fibrosis Who Presented for Severe Tracheal Stenosis After COVID-19 Pneumonia.

Abstract: A 44-year-old man with pulmonary fibrosis presented to our pulmonary hypertension clinic with biphasic stridor and dyspnea. He was sent to the emergency department, where he was found to have 90% subglottic tracheal stenosis and was successfully treated with balloon dilation. Seven months prior to the presentation, heâ€¯required intubation for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia complicated by hemorrhagic stroke. He was discharged after percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy, which was decannulated after three months. Our patient possessed several risk factors for tracheal stenosis, including endotracheal intubation, tracheostomy, and airway infection. Furthermore, our case is of great importance given the developing literature on COVID-19 pneumonia and its subsequent complications. Additionally, his history of interstitial lung disease may have confounded his presentation. Therefore, it is important to understand stridor, as it is an important exam finding that clinically distinguishes upper and lower airway disease. Our patient's biphasic stridor is consistent with the diagnosis of severe tracheal stenosis.
