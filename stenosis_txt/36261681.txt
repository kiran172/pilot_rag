Title: Association between iron status and incident coronary artery disease: a population based-cohort study.

Abstract: Disorders of iron metabolism has been implicated in cardiovascular disease. However, the association of serum iron stores and coronary artery disease (CAD) remains inconsistent. Here, we investigated the associations of serum iron metabolism with the incidence of CAD, the severity of coronary artery stenosis, metabolic biomarkers, and the risk of major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE). A total of 643 CAD patients and 643 healthy controls were enrolled to assess the associations of serum iron status with the presence of CAD, the severity of CAD, and the risk of MACE. Serum iron metabolism and other metabolic markers were measured in all subjects. All statistical analyses were analyzed using SPSS22.0 software and STATA statistical package. Serum level of iron metabolism markers, including serum iron, unsaturated transferrin iron binding capacity (UIBC), Total iron binding capacity (TIBC) levels, in CAD groups was significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.001). UIBC and TIBC were negatively correlated with ferritin in both sexes. Each unit increase of serum iron and TIBC were found to have a protective role for CAD in women (iron: OR 0.794, 95% CI (0.647-0.973), TIBC: OR 0.891, 95% CI (0.795-0.999), P < 0.05). However, high ferritin level was significant associated the CAD incident in both sexes (OR 1.029, 95% CI (1.002-1.058) in men, OR 1.013, 95% CI (1.0-1.025) in women, P < 0.05). Serum iron metabolism markers exhibited no significant association with the severity of CAD. Increased serum level of iron and TIBC levels were found to have a protective role for CAD in women, but not in men. Elevated serum ferritin is independently and positively associated with CAD in men and women.
