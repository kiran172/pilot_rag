Title: Unveiling the Influence of Smoking and Uncontrolled Lipid Profile in the Development of ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: We report a case of a 25-year-old male with the traditional risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD), such as frequent smoking, while the other risk factors such as familial history of CAD were denied and hypertension, obesity, diabetes mellitus, or coagulation factors were not found. Patient was admitted with anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography showed high intracoronary thrombus burden and total occlusion of the proximal segment of left anterior descending artery. Percutaneous coronary intervention was then performed as the treatment of choice, and resulted with no residual stenosis after. The patient had a smooth and progressive recovery.
