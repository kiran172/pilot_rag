Title: A case with life-threatening secondary sclerosing cholangitis caused by nivolumab.

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy has potent anti-cancer effects but is associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs). We present a case who developed secondary sclerosing cholangitis following treatment with nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer who did not respond to immunosuppressive treatments and died of liver failure. A 75Â year-old male with lung cancer who had been treated with nivolumab for non-small cell lung cancer developed Grade 3 liver injury with significant elevation of hepatobiliary enzymes. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed diffuse dilatation of the common bile duct and multifocal stenosis with prestenotic dilatation from the perihilar to intrahepatic bile duct, consistent with sclerosing cholangitis. Histological findings represented an infiltration of mainly CD8-positive T cells around the bile ducts in the liver. Despite treatments with ursodeoxycholic acid, prednisolone, and mycophenolate mofetil, the sclerosing cholangitis did not improve, and the patient died due to liver failure and aggravation of lung cancer. These findings suggest that immune checkpoint inhibitors may lead to resistance to immunosuppressive treatment as well as pose a risk of life-threatening sclerosing cholangitis.
