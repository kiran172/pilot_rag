Title: Iatrogenic bile duct injury during cholecystectomy presenting after 11 years as a biliary stricture: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Benign biliary stricture is an infrequent condition and the majority occur following cholecystectomy. This case report highlights the occurrence of such a stricture 11 years after cholecystectomy without development of biliary cirrhosis.
CASE PRESENTATION: Our patient was a 55-year-old Nepalese woman who presented to our hospital with cholangitis of 1-month duration and a history of cholecystectomy 11 years ago. A diagnosis of benign biliary stricture without features of biliary cirrhosis was made, and the patient was successfully managed with a multidisciplinary approach.
CONCLUSION: Benign biliary stricture can present even decades after cholecystectomy. Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is the treatment of choice, and a long-term favorable outcome can be expected.
