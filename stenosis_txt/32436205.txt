Title: Moyamoya Presenting after Whole Body Cryotherapy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND PURPOSE: Moyamoya syndrome is the progressive stenosis of intracranial carotids with secondary collateralization. Whole body cryotherapy (WBC) involves external cooling and is used in holistic and sports medicine, its neurologic effects are unknown.
CASE REPORT: We report a first case of symptoms of moyamoya syndrome presenting following WBC and diagnosed with classic MRI ( "Brush Sign", "Ivy sign") and digital subtracted angiography.
CONCLUSION: WBC may provoke symptoms of moyamoya syndrome possibly through hyperventilation or vasoconstriction. Practitioners should be aware of possible consequences of WBC in patients with poor cerebrovascular reserve.
