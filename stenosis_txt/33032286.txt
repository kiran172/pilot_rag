Title: Prevalence and Risk Factors of Silent Brain Infarction in Patients with Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Silent brain infarction (SBI) is an independent risk factor for subsequent symptomatic stroke in the general population. Although aortic stenosis (AS) is also known to be associated with an increased risk of future symptomatic stroke, little is known regarding the prevalence and risk factors for SBI in patients with AS.
METHODS: The study population comprised 83 patients with severe AS with no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack and paralysis or sensory impairment (mean age 75 ± 7 years). All patients underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging to screen for SBI and multidetector-row computed tomography to quantify the aortic valve calcification (AVC) volume. Comprehensive transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography were performed to evaluate left atrial (LA) abnormalities, such as LA enlargement, spontaneous echo contrast, or abnormal LA appendage emptying velocity (<20 cm/s), and complex plaques in the aortic arch.
RESULTS: SBI was detected in 38 patients (46%). Multiple logistic regression analysis indicated that CHA2DS2-VASc score and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were independently associated with SBI (p < 0.05), whereas LA abnormalities and AVC volume were not. When patients were divided into 4 groups according to CHA2DS2-VASc score and eGFR, the group with a higher CHA2DS2-VASc score (≥4) and a lower eGFR (<60 mL/min/1.73 m2) had a greater risk of SBI than the other groups (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that AS is associated with a high prevalence of SBI, and that the CHA2DS2-VASc score and eGFR are useful for risk stratification.
