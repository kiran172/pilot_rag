Title: [Endovascular management of chronic mesenteric ischemia : retrospective single-centre study].

Abstract: Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a clinical entity linked to a gradual decrease in coelio-mesenteric arterial flow caused by occlusive disease of the digestive arterial axes. There are many etiologies of CMI, but most of the time atherosclerosis is the leading cause. Due to the development of collateral networks, clinical manifestations of CMI are very rare although some degree of stenosis of the digestive arteries is frequently found in asymptomatic elderly patients. Symptomatic CMI typically presents with the triad «post-meal abdominal pain - fear of eating - weight loss». Open surgical treatment was the gold standard for the management of symptomatic CMI since 1958. However, from 1980 and the introduction of endovascular treatment, percutaneous angioplasty combined with with stenting became the most common revascularization technique for CMI. The objective of this article is to report the results associated with endovascular therapy in patients with CMI at our hospital over the past 8 years.
