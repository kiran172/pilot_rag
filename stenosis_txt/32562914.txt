Title: Roll of stenosis severity, artery radius and blood fluid behavior on the flow velocity in the arteries: Application in biomedical engineering.

Abstract: In this work, the Sisko model is involved for blood flow simulation in the arteries with triangular shapes of stenosis, which is different in severities of 20%, 30%, and 40%, respectively. Firstly, the effects of different severity of stenosis as much as 20%, 30%, and 40% are investigated in the velocity of blood while artery radius of 0.002 m and Sisko parameters of n = 0.639 and b = 0.1735 are constant. Then, stenosis with the severity of 40% remains, and the radius of the artery is varied from 0.002 m to 0.0035 m to investigate the effects of artery radius on the blood velocity. Finally, different types of blood fluids are employed by manipulation of Sisko parameters, and influences of blood fluid behaviors are investigated in velocity profiles. It is reported that influences of increasing severity of stenosis and reducing the radius of the artery cause blood velocity to be augmented due to the role of stenosis as an obstacle against blood flow and influences of artery radius in reducing cross-section area of the vessel. Maximum velocities are roundabout 0.15 m/s, 0.185 m/s of 0.235 m/s in order of stenosis of 20%, 30% and 40% respectively. Also, investigation in the effects of the behavior of different blood showed that blood fluid types could change maximum flow velocity as much as 0.025 m/s. Despite of roll of stenosis severity, artery radius, and blood fluid behavior in exacerbation of velocity deviation, it was concluded that their consequences for the human body healthy can be ignorable in the range of studied.
