Title: Spontaneous Regression of Cystic Adventitial Disease of the Popliteal Artery: A Case Report.

Abstract: Spontaneous regression of cystic adventitial disease (CAD) of the popliteal artery is rare. In this report, we describe a 53-year-old woman who presented with left calf pain and was diagnosed with CAD with popliteal artery stenosis, which regressed without therapy. The disease was diagnosed via computed tomography, and a surgical intervention was planned at the time of diagnosis. However, her symptoms disappeared 2 months after the initial presentation. Ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed spontaneous regression of the cystic lesions and resolution of the popliteal artery stenosis. During the 29-month follow-up period, her symptoms did not recur. Although CAD often requires surgical intervention, it may be acceptable to carefully observe patients with spontaneous regression for some time to check for recurrence.
