Title: Lessons From ACST-2.

Abstract: The recent 130-center, international, second ACST trial (Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery Trial) involving 3625 patients found that regardless of whether a patient underwent stenting or endarterectomy, the periprocedural risk of disabling or fatal stroke was about 1% and the 5-year estimated risk of nonprocedural disabling or fatal stroke was 2.5%. With advances in technique, technology, and patient selection, stenting done by appropriately trained and experienced operators can achieve safety and efficacy comparable to endarterectomy for asymptomatic patients. The ongoing CREST-2 trial (Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial) will clarify whether revascularization, by either stenting or endarterectomy, remains an important therapeutic goal in the setting of modern intensive medical therapy.
