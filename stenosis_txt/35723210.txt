Title: Systematic Review of Slide Tracheoplasty Outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify factors predicting success in slide tracheoplasty surgery at a regional children's hospital and compare with available published literature.
MEASURES: Retrospective chart review comparing demographics (age, weight) and clinical (operative and hospital course, need for additional airway intervention) factors experienced with slide tracheoplasty. Findings were compared with a systematic review of published literature.
RESULTS: Of the 16 tracheal stenosis patients in our cohort, 13 (81.3%) presented with an additional congenital or cardiovascular anomaly. When adjusted for cardiovascular anomalies, congenital tracheal stenosis patients had a mean age of 5.2 months (range 6 days-17 months), mean weight of 5.04 kg, and average ICU and hospital length of stay of 31.5 and 36.0 days, respectively. Tracheostomy was required for 4 patients and no early deaths were recorded. Of the 391 children in the grouped cohort, mean age and weight was older at 7.67 months and larger at 5.70 kg. Length of stay in both ICU and overall hospital course was 31.6 and 43.5 days, respectively. Mortality etiology for 44 patients was reported: 17 (38.6%) cardiac-related and 28 (63.6%) late mortalities. Our overall calculated mortality risk of 1.26 (P &lt; .05) was lower than reported ratios of 2.0+.
CONCLUSION: Despite the numerous institutional studies involving tracheal stenosis, mortality and surgical challenges remain high. Future studies with the inclusion of specific perioperative data can prove to further evaluate correlations between presentation characteristics and mortality.
