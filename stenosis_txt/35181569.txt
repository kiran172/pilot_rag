Title: Fully Covered Self-expanding Stents are Cost-effective at Remediating Biliary Strictures in Patients With Chronic Pancreatitis.

Abstract: Benign biliary strictures (BBS) develop in up to 10% to 30% of patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP).1 Endoscopic endoprosthetics via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) has become the standard of care for remediating these strictures. Seventy percent to eighty percent of these strictures resolve with sequential or concurrent placement of multiple plastic stents (MPS).1,2 More recently, placement of fully covered self-expanding metal stents (FCSEMS) have been shown to have similar outcomes as MPS.3-6 FCSEMS provide a larger radial diameter and require fewer procedures, but may have drawbacks, including a higher risk of migration, cholecystitis, delamination, and tissue ingrowth. A recent study demonstrated that FCSEMS with a 12-month indwell had similar outcomes to MPS with fewer ERCP needed.7 However, the cost-effectiveness of either strategy for managing BBS has not been assessed previously nor has the impact of additional reimbursement to cover the cost of FCSEMS on the cost-effectiveness of FCSEMS utilization.
