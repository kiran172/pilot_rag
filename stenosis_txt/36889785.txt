Title: Forbearance with endobronchial stenting: cognisance before conviction.

Abstract: Endobronchial stenting is an important aspect of the practice of interventional pulmonology. The most common indication for stenting is the management of clinically significant airway stenosis. The list of endobronchial stents available on the market continues to grow. More recently, patient-specific 3D-printed airway stents have been approved for use. Airway stenting should be considered only when all other options have been exhausted. Due to the environment of the airways and the stent-airway wall interactions, stent-related complications are common. Although stents can be placed in various clinical scenarios, they should only be placed in scenarios with proven clinical benefit. The unwarranted placement of a stent can expose the patient to complications with little or no clinical benefit. This article reviews and outlines the key principles of endobronchial stenting and important clinical scenarios in which stenting should be avoided.
