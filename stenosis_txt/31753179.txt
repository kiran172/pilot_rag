Title: Prevalence and Prognostic Implications of Frailty in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Assessment of frailty has become engrained in the preprocedural evaluation of older adults referred for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Addition of frailty and disability to clinical risk scores results in improved discrimination for short- and midterm mortality and identifies patients less likely to be discharged home and more likely to report worsening quality of life over the ensuing 6 to 12Â months. In clinical practice, frailty can be evaluated by a tiered approach starting with a brief screening tool such as the Essential Frailty Toolset.
