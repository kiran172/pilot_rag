Title: Transcatheter Therapy for Mitral Valve Stenosis.

Abstract: Mitral valve stenosis remains highly prevalent among the US population although with dramatically shifting demographics. The significance of rheumatic mitral disease in developing nations persists, despite improvements in preventative measures and early detection, and its presence in developed countries is still evident as observed through international migration. In addition, the substantial growth in the aging population with a heightened occurrence of concurrent cardiovascular risk factors is leading to an increased prevalence of chronic calcific degeneration and degeneration of previously repaired or replaced valves. This article aims to review various transcatheter therapies in the treatment of mitral valve stenosis.
