Title: Short-term glycemic variability and intracranial atherosclerotic plaque stability assessed by high-resolution MR vessel wall imaging in type 2 diabetes mellitus.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between short-term glycemic variability in patients with T2DM and the vulnerability of intracranial atherosclerotic plaques using HR-MR-VWI.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 203 patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS)/transient ischemia (TIA) combined with T2DM were enrolled. All of them underwent HR-MR-VWI during the period between July 2020 and July 2023. 203 patients were divided into groups with higher (1,5-AG≤ 30.7 μmol/L) and lower (1,5-AG> 30.7 μmol/L) short-term glycemic variability. Patients were also divided into the T1WI and non-T1WI hyperintensity groups. Associated factors(FBG, HbA1c, and 1,5-AG)for the T1WI hyperintensity were analyzed by binary logistic regression. We used the area under the curve (AUC), while the sensitivity and specificity were calculated at the optimal threshold. The Delong test was employed to compare the quality of the AUC of the predictors.
RESULTS: The group with higher short-term glycemic variability had a higher incidence of the hyperintensity on T1WI, higher degree of enhancement, higher degree of stenosis and smaller lumen area (P < 0.05). The T1WI hyperintensity group had higher HbA1c levels, higher hemoglobin levels and lower 1,5-AG levels(P < 0.05). 1,5-AG (OR = 0.971, 95 % CI: 0.954∼0.988, P = 0.001), HbA1c (OR=1.305, 95 % CI: 1.065∼1.598, P = 0.01) and male sex (OR = 2.048, 95 % CI: 1.016∼4.128, P = 0.045)/(OR=2.102, 95 % CI: 1.058∼4.177, P = 0.034) were independent risk factors for the hyperintensity on T1WI. 1,5-AG demonstrated enhanced performance and yielded the highest AUC of the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC = 0.726), with sensitivity and specificity values of 0.727 and 0.635 respectively.
CONCLUSION: 1,5-AG, HbA1c and male sex are independent predictors of intracranial plaques with T1WI hyperintensity, the greater short-term glycemic variability, the higher incidence of vulnerable plaques.
