Title: In-vivo efficacy of biodegradable ultrahigh ductility Mg-Li-Zn alloy tracheal stents for pediatric airway obstruction.

Abstract: Pediatric laryngotracheal stenosis is a complex congenital or acquired airway injury that may manifest into a potentially life-threatening airway emergency condition. Depending on the severity of obstruction, treatment often requires a combination of endoscopic techniques, open surgical repair, intraluminal stenting, or tracheostomy. A balloon expandable biodegradable airway stent maintaining patency while safely degrading over time may address the complications and morbidity issues of existing treatments providing a less invasive and more effective management technique. Previous studies have focused on implementation of degradable polymeric scaffolds associated with potentially life-threatening pitfalls. The feasibility of an ultra-high ductility magnesium-alloy based biodegradable airway stents was demonstrated for the first time. The stents were highly corrosion resistant under in vitro flow environments, while safely degrading in vivo without affecting growth of the rabbit airway. The metallic matrix and degradation products were well tolerated by the airway tissue without exhibiting any noticeable local or systemic toxicity.
