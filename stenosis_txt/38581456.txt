Title: Analysis of gap length as a predictor of surgical outcomes in esophageal atresia with distal fistula: a single center experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Long-gap esophageal atresia (LGEA) is still a challenge for pediatric surgery. No consensus exists as to what constitutes a long gap, and few studies have investigated the maximum gap length safely repairable by primary anastomosis. Based on surgical outcomes at a single institution, we aimed to determine the gap length in LGEA with a high risk of complications.
METHODS: The medical records of 51, consecutive patients with esophageal atresia (EA) with primary repair in the early neonatal period between 2001 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed. Three, major complications were found in the surgical outcomes: (1) anastomotic leakage, (2) esophageal stricture requiring dilatation, and (3) GERD requiring fundoplication. The predictive power of the postsurgical complications was assessed using receiver operating characteristic analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) and the cutoff value with a specificity of > 90% were calculated.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients (31.4%) experienced a complication. The AUC of gap length was0.90 (p < 0.001), and the gap length cutoff value was ≥ 2.0 cm for predicting any complication (sensitivity: 62.5%, specificity: 91.4%).
CONCLUSION: A gap length ≥ 2.0 cm was considered as defining LGEA and was associated with an extremely high complication rate after primary repair.
