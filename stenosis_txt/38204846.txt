Title: Pulmonary Congestion by Conventional Chest Radiography: Relationship With Hemodynamics and Mortality in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationship between chest radiograph (CXR) findings of pulmonary congestion and invasive hemodynamics and clinical outcomes in patients with cardiac diseases is unclear. We assessed the correlation between a CXR-based congestion score (RxCS) and the mean pulmonary artery wedge pressure (mPAWP) and the prognostic impact of RxCS and mPAWP in severe aortic stenosis (AS).
METHODS: In 471 patients with severe AS undergoing right heart catheterization and upright CXR, the RxCS was calculated (6 items, maximum score: 10 points) independently by 2 radiologists (average value taken) blinded to clinical data. Congestion was defined as an RxCS > 1. Four patterns were defined based on the presence or absence of congestion (C+ or C-) and elevated (> 15 mm Hg) or normal mPAWP (P+ or P-).
RESULTS: The median (interquartile range) RxCS was 1 (0-2). Patients with an RxCS &gt; 1 (n = 207) had a higher mean right atrial pressure, mean pulmonary artery pressure, mPAWP, and pulmonary vascular resistance than patients with an RxCS ≤ 1 (n = 264). However, the correlation between the RxCS and the mPAWP was moderate only (r = 0.45). Patients with a C+/P+ pattern had the worst hemodynamics, whereas C-/P- patients had the most favourable constellation. After a median post-valve replacement follow-up of 1361 days, mortality was higher in patients with RxCs &gt; 1 vs ≤ 1 as well as mPAWP &gt; 15 mm Hg vs ≤15 mm Hg. Mortality was highest in C+/P+ patients and lowest in C-/P- patients, whereas it was intermediate in C-/P+ and C+/P- patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In AS patients, RxCS and mPAWP have a significant but moderate correlation. Both RxCS and mPAWP provide prognostic information.
