Title: Minimally invasive resection of gastric GIST tumor by trans-gastric approach: A case report of a novel technique.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: GIST (Gastro Intestinal Stromal Tumor) treatment is surgical however surgical resection, especially for gGIST (gastric GIST), may be challenging due to location of tumor and the possible sequelae post resection.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of 66-year-old female presented for the management of gGIST. We opted for transgastric resection assisted by robot. The resection was with free surgical margins for a 4Â cm GIST tumor low in grade.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: Classical wedge resection of gastric tumors poses post-operative complications especially if the tumor is located near the cardia or pylorus. Various minimally invasive techniques were described aiming to avoid post-operative complications as in stenosis and gastric reflux.
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive transgastric resection of gGIST tumor seems to be worth of attention for it can prevent stenosis, hemorrhage and can preserve gastric tissue. Further studies need to be involved to endorse this technique.
