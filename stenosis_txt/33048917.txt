Abstract: The case of a 73-year-old female patient obtained and resident of Florencia, Caquetá (Colombia), with a history of hypertension who is admitted to a highly complex hospital due to a 3-month clinical picture of constant evolution in pain is presented. Thoracic oppressive type in the anterior region of the left thorax, non-irradiated, of intensity 8/10. The echocardiogram shows calcified aortic valve disease with severe aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, left ventricular hypertrophy, and mild grade mitral regurgitation. Within the pre-surgical studies, she presented VDRL with 1:4 dilutions and the diagnosis was confirmed with the result of the treponemal test and other infectious diseases were ruled out. Valvular replacement was performed with a bioprosthesis plus a supra-coronary valvular tube. In the biopsy, chronic scar valvulitis with extensive calcifications was confirmed. After the surgical intervention, discharge was performed due to adequate clinical evolution.
