Title: Treatment of external auditory canal stenosis and atresia after transcanal endoscopic ear surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To discuss the treatment of external auditory canal stenosis or atresia occurring as a complication of transcanal endoscopic ear surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 11 patients who developed external auditory canal stenosis or atresia after undergoing transcanal endoscopic ear surgery. The 10 patients with stenosis were treated with external auditory canal expansion via drainage tube insertion; 2 of these patients further received local injections of triamcinolone acetonide. One patient with atresia was treated with meatoplasty surgery followed by tube insertion and triamcinolone acetonide injection.
RESULTS: The stenosis/atresia improved in all patients, and the external auditory canal was unobstructed without restenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Stenosis/atresia of the external auditory canal after transcanal endoscopic ear surgery should be treated with dilation therapy/meatoplasty in a timely manner to prevent progressive hyperplasia of the scar and regain a normal-sized ear canal.
