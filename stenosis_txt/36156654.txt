Title: [Findings of optical coherence tomography in saphenous grafts failure. Report of one case].

Abstract: Atherosclerosis is the main cause of late saphenous vein graft (SVG) failure. Intracoronary images using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in addition to angiography allow a detailed analysis of the lesion beyond the degree of stenosis. We report a 67 years old diabetic male who underwent coronary surgery in 2009, consulting for an acute coronary syndrome. Angiography showed two different lesions on one aortocoronary venous grafts. OCT demonstrates atherosclerosis in different stages identifying the culprit lesion. Stent placement were successfully carried out.
