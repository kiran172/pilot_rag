Title: Suicide left ventricle following protamine: A case report.

Abstract: A patient with severe aortic stenosis and left ventricular hypertrophy underwent a transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The patient's blood pressure significantly dropped after protamine administration. A diagnosis of suicide left ventricle post-valve replacement was made. The diagnosis and management of the protamine reaction are detailed. This case highlights the need to slowly infuse protamine sulfate and monitor for adverse events.
