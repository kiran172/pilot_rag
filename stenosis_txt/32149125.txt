Title: Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery Vascular Hyperintensities in Transient Ischemic Attack within the Anterior Circulation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship of fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) vascular hyperintensities (FVH) with haemodynamic abnormality and severity of arterial stenosis in patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) of the carotid artery system. Patients and Methods. Consecutive inpatients (N = 38) diagnosed with TIAs of the carotid system in a 4-year period (2014-2017) were retrospectively analysed in our study and divided into FVH-negative and FVH-positive groups based on the presence of FVH sign. Each inpatient had undergone magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) followed by computed tomography (CT) perfusion imaging studies. We investigated the degree of arterial stenosis, number of stenosis, watershed regions, and related CT perfusion indexes, including hypoperfusion regions, mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood flow (CBF), and cerebral blood volume (CBV). Spearman rank correlation was performed between FVHs score, the degree of arterial stenosis, and CT perfusion indexes with significant difference.
RESULTS: Thirty-one patients (81.6%) observed with FVH sign were assigned to the FVH-positive group. The hypoperfusion regions, MTT, and CBF values were significantly different between the FVH-negative group and FVH-positive groups. Spearman correlation analysis showed significant positive correlations between hypoperfusion regions, MTT, and FVHs scores (r = 0.755 and 0.674, respectively, p &lt; 0.01); a moderate negative correlation was found between CBF and FVHs scores (r = 0.755 and 0.674, respectively, p &lt; 0.01); a moderate negative correlation was found between CBF and FVHs scores (r = 0.755 and 0.674, respectively, p &lt; 0.01); a moderate negative correlation was found between CBF and FVHs scores (.
CONCLUSION: Hyperintense vessels on FLAIR were closely associated with hypoperfused regions, MTT, and CBF values, which indicated that the presence of FVHs could be an important and convenient imaging marker of haemodynamic impairment in patients with TIA.
