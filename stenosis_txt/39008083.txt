Title: Prognostic value of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity changes post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) offers a solution, especially for high-risk aortic stenosis (AS) patients. However, patient outcomes post-TAVR show variability, highlighting the need for reliable prognostic indicators. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV), a measure of arterial stiffness, may predict outcomes post-TAVR. This study aims to explore baPWV's prognostic value in relation to all-cause mortality post-TAVR. This study prospectively enrolled 212 severe AS patients undergoing TAVR between September 2015 and December 2021, focusing on pre- and post-TAVR baPWV measurements to explore associations with all-cause mortality. Of the 212 patients (119 females, 93 males, mean age 85 years), post-TAVR baPWV increased significantly from 1589 ± 376 to 2010 ± 521 cm/s (p < 0.001). Aortic valve (AV) peak velocity and mean pressure gradient decreased, while AV area increased, indicating procedural success. Despite this, 88% of patients experienced an increase in baPWV, with higher pre-procedure AV peak velocity and mean pressure gradient identified as predictors of increased baPWV post-TAVR. Over 23 months, 29 patients (14%) reached the primary endpoint of all-cause mortality. Notably, changes in baPWV, rather than baseline values, were significantly associated with event-free survival (HR: 0.64 per 1SD increase, p = 0.009). The study highlights the prognostic value of baPWV changes post-TAVR in predicting patient outcomes. Elevated baPWV post-TAVR may reflect a beneficial adaptation to altered hemodynamics, suggesting the need for individualized patient evaluation and the integration of baPWV measurements into clinical practice for improved post-TAVR management.
