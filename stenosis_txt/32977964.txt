Title: Surgical repair of coronary artery ostial stenosis in patients with Williams and elastin arteriopathy syndromes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Patients with Williams and elastin arteriopathy syndromes often have similar cardiac phenotypes characterized by supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS), peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (PPAS), and coronary artery ostial stenosis (CAOS). SVAS and/or PPAS result in a marked increase in myocardial oxygen demand, whereas CAOS may limit myocardial oxygen supply. This combination predisposes to myocardial ischemic events and sudden cardiac arrest. The purpose of this study was to review our experience with the surgical repair of CAOS in patients with Williams and elastin arteriopathy syndromes.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 16 patients with Williams (n = 11) or elastin arteriopathy (n = 5) who underwent surgical repair of CAOS as a concomitant procedure with SVAS and/or PPAS repair. Eleven patients had moderate or severe SVAS, and 10 had PPAS. The median age at surgery was 9 months (range, 3-108 months).
RESULTS: Seven patients had repair of the left main and right coronary ostia, 6 the left main, and 3 the right coronary ostium. Median duration of aortic crossclamp was 56 minutes and cardiopulmonary bypass time was 454 minutes. The median SVAS gradient decreased from 70 to 12 mm Hg and pulmonary artery pressure decreased from 120 to 30 mm Hg. There was 1 operative mortality (6%). The remaining 15 patients were discharged from the hospital and are alive at a median of 17 months' follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrate that patients with Williams and elastin arteriopathy syndromes presenting with SVAS and/or PPAS plus CAOS can undergo successful repair of all hemodynamic issues simultaneously.
