Title: Posterior cervical triangle approach for carotid endarterectomy: Technical note and results.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is usually performed using the anterior cervical triangle as a surgical corridor but, when needed, the retromandibular space makes dissection of higher structures difficult in some cases. The posterior cervical triangle (PCT) can be useful in these demanding cases.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed cases from July 2013 to November 2019 in which PCT was used as an approach for CEA. The surgical technique used was explained, and the complications and evolution of the patients were analysed.
RESULTS: We found 7 CEAs performed through this approach, of which 2 presented transient trapezius paresis. There were no cases of severe complications in this series.
CONCLUSION: The PCT approach for performing CEA represents a useful and easy technique that avoids the need for mandibular mobilisation or osteotomies for lesions located in anatomically high carotid bifurcations.
