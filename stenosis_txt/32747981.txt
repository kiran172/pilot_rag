Title: Late complications of robot-assisted radical cystectomy with totally intracorporeal urinary diversion.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: To evaluate late complications in a large cohort of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with totally intracorporeal urinary diversion (ICUD).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients who underwent RARC and ICUD between August 2012 and June 2019. We excluded patients with Ejection fraction < 36%, retinal vasculopathy, ventriculoperitoneal shunts, and those treated without curative intent. All complications and their onset date have been recorded, defined, and graded according to Clavien classification adapted for radical cystectomy.
RESULTS: 210 patients were included, 76% of whom were men, with a mean age of 62 years. Urinary diversions used were Padua Ileal Bladder (PIB) in 80% of cases, and ileal conduit (IC) in 20% of patients (generally older and with more comorbidity). The mean follow-up was 30 ± 22 months. The stenosis rate of uretero-ileal anastomosis was 14%, while a reduction in eGFR (≥ 20%) was observed in about half of the cases. UTIs occurred in 37% of the patients, especially in the first 12 months. Only 2% of patients had bowel occlusion, whereas incisional hernia, lymphocele, and systemic events (metabolic acidosis and major cardiovascular events) occurred respectively in 20%, 10%, and 1% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study evaluates first late complications in a cohort of patients who underwent RARC with ICUD. These data are encouraging and in line with findings from a historical series of open radical cystectomy (ORC). This study is a further step in supporting RARC as a safe and effective surgical option for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) in tertiary referral centers.
