Title: [A case of left pulmonary artery sling combined with congenital tracheal stenosis in an adult].

Abstract: Pulmonary artery sling in adults is a rare congenital vascular malformation usually accompanied by tracheal and bronchial stenosis. Due to its high mortality risk and relatively poor prognosis, it has rarely been reported in adults. We reported a middle-aged patient who presented with shortness of breath, predominantly after activity, since childhood. He was diagnosed with "tracheal stenosis" in another hospital and received symptomatic treatment. The diagnosis of left pulmonary artery sling with congenital tracheal stenosis was confirmed by multi-slice spiral CT (MSCT), airway examination with flexible bronchoscope and 3D image post-processing system. Data from this case and the related literatures have been summarized and analyzed. This will help clinicians to improve their level of diagnosis and treatment.
