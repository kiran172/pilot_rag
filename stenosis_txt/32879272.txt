Title: [Aortic Valve Replacement 36 Years after the First Mitral Valve Replacement with Björk-Shiley Prosthetic Valve;Report of a Case].

Abstract: A 67-year-old woman was admitted with exertional dyspnea. She had undergone mitral valve replacement with Björk-Shiley prosthetic valve (convexo-concave type) 36 years previously for stenosis and regurgitation in another institute. An echocardiography showed a severe degree of aortic stenosis, and the implanted mitral valve function is normal. We performed aortic valve replacement with a bioprosthetic valve and no prophylactic reoperation for the implanted mitral valve. The postoperative courses were uneventful. The patient was discharged from the hospital in good clinical condition. Postoperative echocardiography showed the prosthetic valves were normal. The close follow-up should be needed to prevent fatal valve dysfunction.
