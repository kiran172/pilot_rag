Title: Cardiac Damage and Conduction Disorders after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Recently, a staging system using 4 grades has been proposed to quantify the extent of cardiac damage associated with aortic stenosis (AS), namely AS-related cardiac damage staging (ASCDS). ASCDS is independently associated with all-cause mortality and important clinical outcomes. To evaluate whether it might be associated with the occurrence of conduction system disorders after TAVI, a total of 119 symptomatic patients with severe AS who underwent a TAVI were categorized according to ASCDS: group 1 (13.5%): no or LV damage; group 2 (58.8%): left atrial/mitral valve damage, atrial fibrillation (AF); group 3 (27.7%): low-flow state, pulmonary vasculature/tricuspid valve/RV damage. After TAVI, 34% of patients exhibited LBBB and 10% high-degree atrioventricular block (HD-AVB). No patient in group 1 developed HD-AVB whereas new LBBB was frequent in groups 2 and 3. Twenty-one patients presented with paroxysmal AF with a higher rate for each group increment (group 1: n = 0, 0%; group 2: n = 11, 15.7%; group 3: n = 10, 30.3%) (p = 0.012). Patients in group 3 had the higher rate of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPMI) (group 1: n = 1, 6.3%; group 2: n = 7, 10%; group 3: n = 9, 27.3%) (p = 0.012). In conclusion, ASCDS might help identify patients at higher risk of conduction disorders and PPMI requirement after TAVI.
