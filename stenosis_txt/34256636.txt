Title: Surgical repair of a special category of arteriovenous fistula outflow stenosis caused by venous valve hyperplasia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated a special category of arteriovenous fistula outflow stenosis caused by venous valve hyperplasia and explored the effectiveness of surgical repair in dealing with this kind of stenosis.
STUDY DESIGN: This retrospective cohort study was conducted from February 2016 to January 2020 in our center. Patients with arteriovenous fistula dysfunction, including flow rate insufficiency, venous hypertension, thrombosis, and aneurysm dilation enlargement, were selected. Stenosis lesions presenting with venous valve hyperplasia were selected after ultrasound screening. All patients underwent surgical repair and were followed up every 6 months after surgery.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients (median age, 54.5 ± 11.2 years; 65.1% men) were included. All procedures were technically successful. Based on intraoperative exploration, 56.5% were reconstructed via autologous vein patch, 17.4% of patients were reconstructed with end-to-end reconstruction after cutting the stenotic segment, 13.0% of cases simply had the valve resected, and 13.0% of cases involved a longitudinal incision and transverse suture. All patients returned to routine dialysis the following day and avoided catheter insertion. The mean follow-up time was 22.5 ± 14.0 (range, 1.3-49.8) months. The patency rates at 2 and 4 years were 92.2% and 79.0%, respectively. Valves harvested from patients were analyzed via Masson staining and immunohistochemical staining, indicating collagen fiber and myofibroblast hyperplasia in outflow venous valve hyperplasia (OVVH).
CONCLUSIONS: Outflow venous valve hyperplasia can lead to fistula dysfunction. Ultrasound is the main method to diagnosis OVVH. Special surgical repair can preserve valuable vascular resources and relieve stenosis, is safe and effective, and has a high patency rate.
