Title: Small Oversized Stent Graft Is Associated With Increased Patency for the Treatment of Central Venous Disease in Hemodialysis Patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify the independent predictors of higher patency rates and investigate the selection of specifications of stent graft in the treatment of central venous disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 54 patients who underwent stent-grafts' placement for the treatment of central venous disease between March 2017 and September 2022 at a tertiary hospital. The demographic data for the patients and the clinical data of the treated lesions were collected and analyzed. The patency rates of the treated lesions with different oversizing range were calculated via the Kaplan-Meier and log-rank analyses. The multivariate Cox proportional hazard models were constructed to identify the independent predictor of the target site primary patency.
RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 21.5 months. The primary patency rates of the target sites were 90.7%, 72.2%, and 55.1% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The assisted primary patency rates of the lesions were 96.3%, 92.5%, and 80.3% at 6, 12, and 24 months, respectively. The log-rank analysis showed that the stent-grafts' placement with small oversizing had significantly higher primary patency rates than those with large oversizing (p=0.022). The multivariate analysis revealed that concomitant stenosis and large oversizing stent graft were the independent predictors of target site primary patency.
CONCLUSIONS: Stent grafts showed reasonable primary patency for the treatment of central venous disease in hemodialysis patients. A stent graft with small oversizing is associated with better target site primary patency rates than those with large oversizing.
CLINICAL IMPACT: Stent grafts showed reasonable primary patency for the treatment of central venous disease in hemodialysis patients. Few studies, however, have explored the efficiency of stent grafts to treat CVD by considering different factors such as sizing considerations, the rate of oversizing percentage, etc. A stent graft with small oversizing is associated with better target site primary patency rates than those with large oversizing. Excessive oversizing should be avoided to prevent infolding or stent collapse.
