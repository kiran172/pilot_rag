Title: Use of the SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Heart Valve in High-Risk Scenarios.

Abstract: The transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure is used in patients with aortic stenosis. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices are quite versatile; thus, they are increasingly being used for nonaortic applications, such as tricuspid valve-in-valve implantation. This case series describes a transcatheter aortic valve replacement procedure in 4 patients with anatomic challenges (eg, aortic tortuosity, high valvular calcium burden, highly calcified bicuspid valve, low coronary artery takeoff, left main coronary artery occlusion, and large aortic annulus) and a fifth patient who had a failed tricuspid bioprosthesis and underwent a tricuspid valve-in-valve implantation with the Edwards SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve (Edwards Lifesciences). All procedures required adjustments to the standard protocol, and each procedure was successful. The critical, technical adjustments in the deployment technique and preprocedural planning of the procedures are detailed to provide a road map for other cardiologists who encounter similar challenges.
