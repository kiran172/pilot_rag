Title: Conduction dynamics over time after transcatheter aortic valve replacement: An expert review.

Abstract: New conduction disorders remain a frequent complication in current transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) era. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) occurs early in about 20-30 % of TAVR-patients, persists at 1 month in about 35-45 % of cases and will likely remain thereafter. Third-degree atrioventricular block (AV3B) affects approximately 15 % of patients. Pacemaker dependency gradually decreases throughout follow-up and approximately 25-35 % of patients remain pacemaker dependent at one year. We aimed to review what is currently known about the dynamics of acquired conduction disorders, including extraction of predictors, and how to interpret these dynamics in light of an early discharge policy.
