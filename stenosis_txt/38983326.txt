Title: Novel magnetic compression technique for the treatment of postoperative anastomotic stenosis in rectal cancer: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment of postoperative anastomotic stenosis after excision of rectal cancer is challenging. Endoscopic balloon dilation and radial incision are not effective in all patients. We present a new endoscopy-assisted magnetic compression technique (MCT) for the treatment of rectal anastomotic stenosis. We successfully applied this MCT to a patient who developed an anastomotic stricture after radical resection of rectal cancer.
CASE SUMMARY: A 50-year-old man had undergone laparoscopic radical rectal cancer surgery at a local hospital 5 months ago. A colonoscopy performed 2 months ago indicated that the rectal anastomosis was narrow due to which ileostomy closure could not be performed. The patient came to the Magnetic Surgery Clinic of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University after learning that we had successfully treated patients with colorectal stenosis using MCT. We performed endoscopy-assisted magnetic compression surgery for rectal stenosis. The magnets were removed 16 d later. A follow-up colonoscopy performed after 4 months showed good anastomotic patency, following which, ileostomy closure surgery was performed.
CONCLUSION: MCT is a simple, non-invasive technique for the treatment of anastomotic stricture after radical resection of rectal cancer. The technique can be widely used in clinical settings.
