Title: A Fatal Case of Staphylococcus capitis Endocarditis in a Patient With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has evolved to become a standard management modality for high-risk, moderate, and even low-risk patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis. Infective endocarditis (IE) after a TAVR is rare and difficult to diagnose. Typical sonographic characteristics observed with an echocardiogram in native valve endocarditis may not be present in TAVR-IE cases. Enterococcal species are identified to be the most frequent causative agents. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) can infrequently lead to a fatal course of endocarditis in the TAVR population. There are only seven previously reported cases of Staphylococcus capitis (S. capitis) prosthetic valve endocarditis noted in the literature. Here we present a man in his 60s who presented to our facility for evaluation of fever and shortness of breath. He was subsequently diagnosed with S. capitis TAVR-IE. He was not considered a surgical candidate and was treated medically for IE with a fatal outcome.
