Title: Cholesterol Crystals are Associated with Carotid Plaque Vulnerability: An Optical Coherence Tomography Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Vulnerable carotid plaque is associated with cerebrovascular events. Cholesterol crystals are often seen in the atherosclerotic plaques. However, the potential role of cholesterol crystals in carotid plaques destabilization is unknown. We aimed to identify the association between cholesterol crystals and carotid plaque vulnerability.
METHODS: Optical coherence tomography assessment of carotid plaque was performed in 95 patients. Clinical characteristics and plaque morphology were examined. The differences in plaque characteristics (thrombus, calcification, neovascularization, and macrophage accumulations) and clinical parameters (age, symptom, coronary heart disease, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and C-reactive protein) between patients with or without cholesterol crystals were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression.
RESULTS: Among 66 patients with acceptable carotid atherosclerotic optical coherence tomography images, 16 were with and 50 were without cholesterol crystals. 56.3% patients (9 of 16) with cholesterol crystals had cerebrovascular ischemic symptom related to ipsilateral internal carotid artery, whereas only 26.0% patients (13 of 50) without cholesterol crystals had symptom (OR, 3.66; 95% CI, 1.13-11.82; P = .025). 75.0% of the plaques with cholesterol crystals had concomitant macrophage accumulation (OR, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.17-14.65; P = .04). In segments with cholesterol crystals, a higher presence of calcification could be demonstrated compared to those without cholesterol crystals (62.5% versus 32.0%, P = .03). 70.0% plaques with cholesterol crystals and calcification were classified as symptomatic plaques (OR, 6.38; 95% CI, 1.46-27.91; P = .01). No association between plaque rupture and cholesterol crystals was identified. Multivariate logistic regression showed that age and macrophage accumulation were independently associated with cholesterol crystals.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid atherosclerotic plaques with cholesterol crystals were more likely to have concomitant macrophage and calcification accumulations. Patients with cholesterol crystals plaque experienced more cerebrovascular symptoms. Thus, cholesterol crystals, especially together with macrophage and calcification, may serve as an important component of venerable carotid plaques.
