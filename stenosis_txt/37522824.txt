Title: [Immune checkpoint inhibitors related cardiovascular toxicity: 3‑mounth follow-up].

Abstract: AIM: To analyze the condition of the cardiovascular system in oncological patients receiving immune antitumor therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) based on results of laboratory and instrumental examinations during a 3-month follow-up.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: This multicenter prospective observational study included 49 patients (25 men and 24 women aged 65.6±8.7 and 64.3±9.6 years, respectively). A laboratory screening (C-reactive proteins, troponin I, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide), EchoCG, and carotid ultrasound were performed for all patients. 27 patients were followed up at 3 months after the antitumor therapy initiation. Statistical analysis was performed with the StatPlus 8.0.3 software.
RESULTS: Incidence of cardiovascular complications was 16.3 %. The following significant changes in EchoCG parameters were observed: LV EF; (p=0.017), increased LV end-systolic volume (ESV) (р=0.023), and increased LV index of myocardial performance (LIMP; р=0.016). The degree of changes in ESV (ΔESV) depended on a history of chronic heart failure (р=0.03), whereas the degree of changes in EF (ΔEF) depended on the patient's age at the initiation of antitumor therapy (р=0.006). Ultrasound showed an increase in maximum carotid stenosis (р=0.018).
CONCLUSION: The study showed a high incidence of newly developed cardiovascular complications associated with the CPI treatment as well as the presence of changes in EchoCG parameters and data of carotid ultrasound.
