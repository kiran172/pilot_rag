Title: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitor-Induced Angioedema With Resultant Airway Obstruction Following Endotracheal Intubation.

Abstract: Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi)-induced angioedema is a consequence of excessive levels of bradykinin and accounts for nearly a third of angioedema cases when patients present to emergency rooms. While rare, patients can present with swelling in the face, tongue, and airways making it a life-threatening emergency. To secure an airway, endotracheal intubation may be conducted; however, tracheal stenosis is a known complication. In this report, we present a 61-year-old female with a history of ACEi-induced angioedema care in which she was intubated with facial swelling. Upon a repeat hospitalization, the patient developed stridor with respiratory distress. Bronchoscopy revealed severe tracheal stenosis with multilevel damage to tracheal rings, warranting urgent tracheostomy. One month after discharge, the patient was seen by an ENT specialist who performed a transnasal laryngoscopy revealing near total subglottic and tracheal stenosis of 3 cm stenosis length, presumed secondary to traumatic intubation for prior angioedema management. This case highlights the importance of careful intubation practices in patients with suspected airway edema.
