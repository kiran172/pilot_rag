Title: Association between severity of the cervical foraminal stenosis and paraspinal muscle parameters in patients undergoing anterior cervical discectomy and fusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The cervical multifidus and rotatores muscles are innervated by the posterior rami of the spinal nerves of the corresponding level, and it has been hypothesized that cervical foraminal stenosis (CFS) affecting the spinal nerves results in changes in these muscles. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the severity of CFS and fat infiltration (FI) of the multifidus and rotatores muscles.
METHODS: Patients who received preoperative cervical MRI, underwent anterior cervical decompression and fusion between 2015 and 2018, and met inclusion and exclusion criteria were included. Multifidus and rotatores muscles were segmented bilaterally from C3 to C7, and the percent FI was measured using custom-written MATLAB software. The severity of the CFS was assessed by the Kim classification. Multivariable linear mixed models were conducted and adjusted for age, sex, BMI, and repeated measures.
RESULTS: In total, 149 patients were included. Linear mixed modeling results showed that a more severe CFS at C3-4 was correlated with a greater FI of the multifidus and rotatores muscles at C4 (estimate 0.034, 95% CI 0.003-0.064; p = 0.031), a more severe CFS at C4-5 was correlated with a greater FI of the multifidus and rotatores muscles at C5 (estimate 0.037, 95% CI 0.015-0.057; p < 0.001), a more severe CFS at C5-6 was correlated with a greater FI of the multifidus and rotatores muscles at C6 (estimate 0.041, 95% CI 0.019-0.062; p < 0.001) and C7 (estimate 0.035, 95% CI 0.012-0.058; p = 0.003), and a more severe CFS at C6-7 was correlated with a greater FI of the multifidus and rotatores muscles at C7 (estimate 0.049, 95% CI 0.027-0.071; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrated level- and side-specific correlations between the FI of the multifidus and rotatores muscles and severity of CFS. Given the segmental innervation of the multifidus and rotatores muscles, the authors hypothesize that the observed increased FI could be reflective of changes due to muscle denervation from CFS.
