Title: Case report of the successful treatment of a rare complication of pulmonary vein stenting: atrial rupture and stent detachment.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is a relatively rare pulmonary vascular disease in clinical practice, and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a common cause of pulmonary vein stenosis. Owing to its nonspecific symptoms and irregular follow-up, PVS is often misdiagnosed. In severe cases, intervention is needed, with the main treatment options being pulmonary vein stenting and/or balloon dilation, both of which carry risks of serious complications. We report a patient with severe pulmonary vein stenosis who experienced right atrial wall rupture and stent detachment during an interventional procedure. Through active intraoperative intervention, we successfully avoided serious complications.
