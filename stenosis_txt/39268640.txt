Title: Surgical management of congenital mitral stenosis in a patient with Kabuki syndrome.

Abstract: Congenital mitral stenosis is a rare anomaly. We report successful surgical management of congenital mitral stenosis in a patient with Kabuki syndrome. A 15-month-old male with Kabuki syndrome was referred and echocardiography showed isolated congenital mitral stenosis. The valve was not repairable as it was showing severe stenotic features in multilevel fashion. Valve was replaced with mechanical valve. Postoperative course was uneventful without any rhythm problem and he has been doing well clinically during the 25 months follow-up with regular international normalized ratio checks.
