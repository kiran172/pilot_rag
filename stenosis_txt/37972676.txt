Title: High-risk admission prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement and subsequent outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis may cause heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or syncope; limited data exist on the occurrence of such events before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and their impact on subsequent outcomes. Thus, we investigated the association between a preceding event and outcomes after TAVR.
METHODS: From 2014 to 2021 all Danish patients who underwent TAVR were included. Preceding events up to 180 days before TAVR were identified. A preceding event was defined as a hospitalization for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction, or syncope. The 1-year risk of all-cause death, and cardiovascular or all-cause hospitalization was compared for patients with versus without a preceding event using Kaplan-Meier, Aalen-Johansen, and in Cox regression analyses adjusted for patient characteristics.
RESULTS: Of 5,851 patients included, 759 (13.0%) had a preceding event. The median age was 81 years in both groups. Male sex and frailty were more prevalent in patients with a preceding event (males: 64.7% vs 55.2%, frailty: 49.6% vs 40.6%). The most common type of preceding event was a hospitalization for heart failure (n = 524). For patients with a preceding event, the 1-year risk of death was 11.7% (95% CI: 9.4%-14.1%) versus 8.0% (95% CI: 7.2%-8.7%) for patients without. The corresponding adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) was 1.29 (95%CI: 1.01-1.64). Mortality was highest for patients with a preceding event of a heart failure admission (1-year risk: 13.5% [95%CI: 10.5%-16.5%]). Comparing patients with a preceding event to those without, the 1-year risk for cardiovascular rehospitalization was 15.0% versus 8.2% (aHR 1.60 [95%CI: 1.29-1.99]) and 57.6% versus 50.6% for all-cause rehospitalization (aHR 1.08 [95%CI: 0.87-1.20]).
CONCLUSIONS: A hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, or syncope prior to TAVR was associated with a poorer prognosis and could represent a group to focus resource management on. Interventions to prevent preceding events and improvements in pre- and post-TAVR optimization of these patients are warranted.
