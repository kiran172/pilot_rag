Title: Comparison of carotid atherosclerotic plaque characteristics between symptomatic patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare the characteristics of carotid plaques between patients with transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
METHODS: Patients with a recent ischemic stroke or TIA who exhibited atherosclerotic plaques of carotid arteries in the symptomatic sides determined by MR vessel wall imaging were recruited. The plaque morphology and compositions including intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH), lipid-rich necrotic-core (LRNC) and calcification were compared between TIA and stroke patients. Logistic regression was performed to relate the plaque characteristics to the types of ischemic events.
RESULTS: A total of 270 patients with TIA or ischemic stroke were recruited. Stroke patients had a significantly higher prevalence of diabetes (42.2% vs. 28.2%, p = 0.021), greater mean wall area (35.1 ± 10.1 mm2 vs. 32.0 ± 7.7 mm2, p = 0.004), mean wall thickness (1.3 ± 0.2 mm vs. 1.2 ± 0.2 mm, p = 0.001), maximum normalized wall index (NWI)(63.9% ± 6.0% vs. 62.2% ± 5.9%, p = 0.023) and %volume of LRNC (9.7% ± 8.2% vs. 7.4% ± 7.9%, p = 0.025) in the carotid arteries compared to those with TIA. After adjustment for clinical factors, above characteristics of carotid arteries were significantly associated with the type of ischemic events. After further adjustment for maximum NWI, this association remained statistically significant (OR, 1.41; CI, 1.01-1.96; p = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: Ischemic stroke patients had larger plaque burden and greater proportion of LRNC in carotid plaques compared to those with TIA. This study suggests that ischemic stroke patients had more vulnerable plaques compared to those with TIA.
