Title: Carotid Artery Stenosis as a Predictor for Stroke Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Stroke remains a clinical risk in the long-term follow-up of patients after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aimed to investigate the association between existing carotid artery stenosis (CS) and the risk of stroke after TAVI. The study participants were consecutive patients who underwent TAVI between 2008 and 2020 and were screened for CS at baseline and at the 30-day follow-up. Hemodynamically relevant CS was defined as a reduction of the carotid artery caliber by &gt;50% in relation to the distal segment. The primary endpoint of this study was ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within 30 days of TAVI. Stroke-related death was also assessed. Of the 1,537 patients included, 220 (14.3%) patients had CS ≥50%. Within 30 days following TAVI, 41 patients (2.7%) experienced an ischemic stroke or TIA, and seven had stroke-related death. The median time from TAVI to stroke/TIA was 3.0 days. Patients with CS ≥50% had a 2.56-fold increased risk of stroke/TIA after TAVI (95%CI: 1.29-5.10, P = .006). The association was consistent in the multivariable model after adjusting for sex, atrial fibrillation, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Investigations are needed to mitigate the risk of stroke in patients with CS ≥50%.
