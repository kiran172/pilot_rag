Title: An Analysis Regarding the Article: Insight Into the Optimal Timing of Percutaneous Coronary Intervention and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an emerging minimally invasive treatment modality that has been shown to reduce mortality significantly compared to medical therapy alone and is superior or noninferior to conventional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with severe and symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) deemed to have an intermediate or higher operative risk. AS patients at intermediate surgical risk, although complications of each procedure were different; with vascular complications and paravalvular leak (PVL) being more common in the TAVI group, whereas several other complications were more frequently found in the SAVR group, including new-onset atrial fibrillation, acute kidney injury and life-threatening bleeding. The risk factors associated with TAVR include larger annulus size (based on MSCT), pre-TAVI transvalvular Vmax, and aortic valve calcification; aortic valve calcification was found to be an independent predictor of PVL.
