Title: Comparative analysis of structural valve deterioration and long-term clinical outcomes after bovine pericardial versus porcine bioprosthetic mitral valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to compare long-term outcomes, including durability, after bovine pericardial valve replacement with those after porcine mitral valve replacement (MVR).
METHODS: We enrolled 309 patients who underwent MV replacement (mean age: 65.8±11.5 years; 68.9% females) with Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT bovine pericardial valves (bovine MVR group, n=241) or Hancock II porcine bioprosthesis (porcine MVR group, n=68). The mean clinical and echocardiographic follow-up durations were 81.4±60.0 and 57.8±53.3 months, respectively. Structural valve deterioration (SVD) was defined as prosthetic mitral valve (MV) regurgitation or stenosis of greater than moderate degree combined with a motion limitation, tear, or perforation of prosthetic valve leaflet on follow-up echocardiography. Propensity score (PS)-adjusted multivariable analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Thirty-day mortality rate was 6.4% (20/309 patients). SVD occurred in 50 patients (33 and 17 patients in the bovine and porcine MV replacement groups, respectively). Cumulative incidences of SVD at 5, 10, and 15 years were 3.2%, 15.9%, and 32.4%, respectively, in the bovine MVR group and 1.9%, 15.3%, and 41.7%, respectively, in the porcine MVR group. Cumulative incidences of SVD in the two groups were not different in competing risk analysis (P=0.23). Other clinical outcomes including overall survival and cumulative incidences of cardiac death and MV-related events were not statistically significantly different between the groups in PS-adjusted multivariable analyses.
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term clinical outcomes including SVD were not different between the bovine and porcine bioprosthesis MVR groups during average 7 years of clinical follow-up after MVR.
