Title: Recanalization of superior mesenteric artery chronic total occlusion using hybrid algorithm and dissection reentry device.

Abstract: Chronic total occlusion (CTO) of mesenteric arteries with associated chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Endovascular intervention has been associated with high technical success with high rates of freedom from symptoms and long-term patency. However, to achieve high procedural success, use of optimal vascular access and expertise in CTO hybrid algorithm including advanced dissection reentry strategies are essential. We present a case of CMI from severe celiac artery (CA) stenosis and CTO of superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). After treatment of CA stenosis, we were unsuccessful in our first attempt at recanalization of SMA CTO. On second attempt, left brachial artery (BA) access was obtained and the hybrid algorithm along with use of Stingray Reentry balloon (Boston Scientific) for dissection reentry into true lumen was successful in recanalizing the SMA CTO with placement of balloon expandable covered stents (CS). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report utilizing Sting-ray Reentry balloon in the mesenteric arteries.
