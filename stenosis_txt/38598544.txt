Title: Trends in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Utilization, Outcomes, and Healthcare Resource Use in Patients With Liver Cirrhosis: A Decade of Insights (2011-2020).

Abstract: It is well known that individuals with liver cirrhosis are considered at high risk for cardiac surgery, with an increased risk for morbidity and mortality as the liver disease progresses. In the last decade, there have been considerable advances in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as an alternative to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in individuals deemed to be at high risk for surgery. However, research surrounding TAVI in the setting of liver cirrhosis has not been as widely studied. In this national population-based cohort study, we evaluated the trends of mortality, complications, and healthcare utilization in liver cirrhotic patients undergoing TAVI, as well as analyzed the basic demographics of these individuals. We found that from 2011 to 2020, the amount of TAVI procedures conducted in cirrhotic patients was increasing annually, while mortality, procedural complications, and healthcare utilization trends in these cirrhotic patients undergoing TAVI decreased. Overall, TAVI does seem to be reasonable management for aortic stenosis patients with liver cirrhosis who need aortic valve replacement.
