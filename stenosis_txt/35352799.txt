Title: RNF207 exacerbates pathological cardiac hypertrophy via post-translational modification of TAB1.

Abstract: AIMS: The heart undergoes pathological remodelling, featured by the hypertrophic growth of cardiomyocytes and increased cardiac fibrosis, under biomechanical stress such as haemodynamic overload. Ring Finger Protein 207 (RNF207) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is predominantly expressed in the heart, but its function remains elusive. In this study, we aimed to explore the role of RNF207 in the development of pathological cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) surgery was performed on mice to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Cardiac function and remodelling were evaluated by echocardiography, histological assessment, and molecular analyses. Our data indicated that RNF207 overexpression (OE) exacerbated cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and systolic dysfunction. In contrast, TAC-induced cardiac remodelling was profoundly blunted in RNF207 knockdown (KD) hearts. In line with the in vivo findings, RNF207 OE augmented, whereas RNF207 KD alleviated, phenylephrine-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Mechanistically, we demonstrated that RNF207 elicited detrimental effects by promoting K63-linked ubiquitination of TAK1-binding protein 1 (TAB1), which triggered the autophosphorylation of transforming growth factor-Î² activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and the activation of downstream p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)1/2 signalling pathways. In the TAB1-KD cardiomyocytes, RNF207-OE-induced cell hypertrophy was significantly attenuated, indicating that RNF207-induced hypertrophy is, at least in part, TAB1-dependent.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that RNF207 exacerbates pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction via post-translational modification of TAB1.
