Title: Robotic Hepaticojejunostomy for Late Anastomotic Biliary Stricture After Liver Transplantation: Technical Description and Case Series.

Abstract: Biliary strictures after liver transplantation are common and when refractive to endoscopic and percutaneous intervention require surgical revision. Robotic technology facilitates minimally invasive biliary reconstruction and has not previously been described after liver transplantation. Robotic biliary revisions were retrospectively compared to all the historical open cases over a time period from May 2013 to October 2020. During the study period there were 3 robotic and 4 open surgical biliary revisions with a follow-up of at least 6months. All cases were hepaticojejunostomies for late choledocho-choledochostomy anastomotic strictures presenting > 4 weeks after transplant and refractive to at least 3 endoscopic and/or percutaneous interventions. Median (range) case time was longer in the robotic group, 373 minutes (286-373) compared to open group, 280 minutes (163-321). The median length of stay was shorter in the robotic group, 4 days (1--4) compared to open group 7 days (4-10). Morbidity included 2 wound infections in the open group (grade II), 1 infected hematoma in the robotic group (grade Ilia), and 1 bile leak on the open group (grade Ilia). There was no biliary stricture recurrence or mortality in either group. Robotic biliary revision is a safe alternative to traditional open biliary revision for refractive biliary strictures after liver transplantation.
