Title: Serial echocardiographic evaluation of the Perimount Magna Ease prosthesis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The Carpentier-Edwards Perimount Magna Ease prosthesis (PME) represents the latest generation of stented bioprostheses used for surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). The aim of our study was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcome and hemodynamic performance of the prosthesis with a focus on the incidence and course of structural valve deterioration (SVD) by serial echocardiographic examinations.
METHODS: SAVR with the PME was performed in 58 consecutive patients between 2007 and 2008. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed preoperatively, at discharge and annually during a 10-year follow-up at the German Heart Center Munich.
RESULTS: Mean age at surgery was 62±14 years. At discharge (n=57), the overall mean pressure gradient (MPG) and effective orifice area (EOA) were 15.8±4.1 mmHg and 1.8±0.4 cm2, respectively. Moderate patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) was present in 18 patients (32%) and severe PPM in 6 patients (11%) at discharge. Ten years following SAVR (n=33), the overall MPG was 16.6±7.3 mmHg and EOA was 1.3±0.4 cm2.Thirty-day and late mortality was 2% (n=1) and 21% (n=12), respectively. Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 94.7%±3.3%, 91.1%±4.1%, and 77.3%±5.9%, respectively. Freedom from reoperation at 10 years was 88.8%±4.7%. Ten years after PME implantation the cumulative incidence of any SVD, severe SVD, and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) was 25%±6%, 14%±5%, and 16%±5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The PME shows an excellent hemodynamic performance over the course of 10 years with development of clinically relevant SVD as late as 6 years post implant, and a 10-year incidence of severe SVD of 14%.
