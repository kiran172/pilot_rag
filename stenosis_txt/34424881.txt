Title: Antihypertensive therapy in patients with moderate to severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Patients with aortic stenosis are at risk for developing hypertension. The selection of antihypertensives is a topic of debate due to a lack of consensus regarding their safety. This article provides an overview of antihypertensives used in patients with aortic stenosis, focusing on renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, beta-blockers, diuretics, and vasodilators.
