Title: Bracka verses Byar's two-stage repair in proximal hypospadias associated with severe chordee: a randomized comparative study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Proximal hypospadias associated with severe chordee represents a major surgical challenge and the debate over its optimal treatment is ongoing. The objective of this study is to compare the outcome of two-stage Bracka and Byar's repair in proximal hypospadias.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted from January 2013 to February 2018 in a tertiary care centre. Patients of hypospadias with severe chordee who required urethral plate transection were included in the study. Patients were randomly divided into two groups by simple randomization method. Bracka staged repair was done in Group A and Byar's staged repair in Group B. Postoperatively complications including graft loss, flap necrosis, fistula formation, meatal stenosis, stricture, diverticula formation, residual chordee were noted in both the groups and compared. p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Over a period of 5 years, 74 patients in group A and 68 patients in group B were operated. Fistula occurred in 6.8% and 10.2% in group A and group B, respectively (p value 0.629). Meatal stenosis was seen in 4% in group A and 3% in group B (p value 0.731). Stricture was seen in 1% in each group (p value 0.339). Diverticula formation was seen in 2% in group B and none of the patient in group A (p value 0.960). None of the patient had recurrence of chordee in either group.
CONCLUSION: Bracka and Byar's two-stage repair have similar postoperative outcome and the choice between the two depends up on the surgeon's choice and experience rather than scientific evidence.
