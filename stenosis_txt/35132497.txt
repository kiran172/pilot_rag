Title: Predictors for second-stage posterior direct decompression after lateral lumbar interbody fusion: a review of five hundred fifty-seven patients in the past five years.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To analyze the predictors for second-stage posterior direct decompression (PDD) after lateral lumbar interbody fusion (LLIF) procedure.
METHODS: We studied patients who underwent LLIF for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis in the last five years, from July 2016 to June 2021. All surgical levels were grouped according to Schizas' central canal stenosis (CCS) classification, Pathria's facet joint degeneration (FJD) classification, Bartynski's lateral recess stenosis (LRS) classification, and Lee's foraminal stenosis (FS) classification. Second-stage PDD rates of each subgroup and their annual change were analyzed. Evaluation of risk factors associated with PDD was investigated.
RESULTS: A total of 901 segments from 557 patients were included. The overall PDD rate was 29.97%. An overall PDD rate of 75.21% for grade D CCS, 29.74% for grade C CCS, 41.67% for grade 3 FJD, 37.61% for grade 3 LRS, and 40.70% for grade 3 FS was shown. While there was a continuous decline in annual PDD rate in the past four years, the annual PDD rate for grade D remained at very high levels. Logistic regression analysis had shown grade D CCS as the utmost risk factor for PDD (OR = 17.77). And grade 3 LRS (OR = 4.63), grade 3 FS (OR = 2.42), grade C CCS (OR = 2.41), and grade 3 FJD (OR = 2.04) were also moderately correlated with PDD, which meant they only moderately increased the risk of PDD.
CONCLUSION: Extreme severe lumbar CCS (grade D) is the greatest determinant to perform the second-stage PDD procedure after LLIF.
