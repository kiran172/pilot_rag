Title: Dural sinus mechanical thrombectomy and continuous local rt-PA infusion in a child with refractory intracranial hypertension and progressive visual loss: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Children with intracranial hypertension are at risk for visual loss and their visual function must be closely monitored. Surgery with the insertion of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is imperative when vision is threatened.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Herein, we report a case of a 5-year-old boy whose refractory intracranial hypertension and severe, progressive visual loss (secondary to a chronic, otogenic, right sigmoid sinus thrombosis, and a contralateral sinus tight stenosis) were resolved by a combination of continuous (6 h), locoregional, infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA), and mechanical thrombectomy.
CONCLUSION: The association of in loco and continuous infusion of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt- PA) with mechanical thrombectomy resulted in effective in partially reopening the occluded sinus and facilitating a good clinical recovery. This combined endovascular approach may represent an alternative, less invasive, therapeutic option to surgery in children with intracranial hypertension caused by chronic cerebral venous sinus thrombosis.
