Title: Carotid Artery Pathology in Inflammatory Diseases.

Abstract: There is considerable evidence that patients with inflammatory conditions are at higher risk of developing cardiovascular (CV) disease including carotid artery stenosis. CV disease accounts for 35-50% of the excess mortality in patients with inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, with cerebrovascular disease being the second leading cause of death. We review current evidence regarding the association of inflammatory conditions and specifically carotid artery disease. Clinical epidemiological observations suggest that mechanisms other than classic risk factors may promote accelerated atherogenesis in rheumatoid and other inflammatory arthritis and carotid artery disease is increased in individuals with these conditions. Additional studies to better understand the underlying mechanisms and targeted strategies to mitigate such risk are indicated. For now, lifestyle modifications, aggressive treatment of risk factors and lipid lowering therapy in appropriate individuals is indicated.
