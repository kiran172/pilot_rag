Title: Modification of book-binding technique during totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with Billroth I reconstruction.

Abstract: The book-binding technique (BBT) has been developed to minimise extra detachment and mobilisation of the duodenum for totally laparoscopic distal gastrectomy (TLDG) with Billroth I reconstruction. Because of the cost-effectiveness and maximisation of the anastomotic lumen, we have modified the BBT in collaboration with the laparoscopic hand-sewing technique. Herein, we introduce a modified BBT (MBBT) and discuss its outcomes. The MBBT was performed using laparoscopic hand-sewing techniques with an absorbable barbed suture instead of using linear staples to close the defect of the anterior wall of the anastomosis site. The data of 163 patients with gastric cancer who underwent TLDG with Billroth I reconstruction performed with MBBT were retrospectively collected between April 2014 and December 2019. The mean anastomosis time was 25 min (interquartile range, 21 - 30). Postoperative complications of Clavien-Dindo grade II or greater occurred in 20 of the 163 patients (12.3%). Anastomotic leakage occurred in three patients (1.8%), whereas anastomotic stenosis occurred in one patient (0.6%). The cumulative incidence rate of anastomotic stenosis that required endoscopic dilation at 1 year was 1.2%. The MBBT method may be safe, practical, cost-effective and results in reduced staple use and anastomotic time.
