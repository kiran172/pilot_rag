Title: Cervical Stenosis: Previously Unrecognized Cause of False-Negative Human Papillomavirus Tests in Women Developing Cervical Cancer.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Cervical stenosis can jeopardize adequate posttreatment cytologic follow-up of patients treated for high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions. An impact on human papillomavirus (HPV) testing has not been described.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We describe 2 patients with cervical stenosis, followed by cytology and HPV co-testing after excisions of high-grade cervical intraepithelial lesions. Each had 1 or more co-test "double-negative" results. Hysterectomies revealed unexpected cervical carcinomas.
RESULTS: In case 1, an 80-year-old woman with complete cervical stenosis and earlier high-grade squamous dysplasia presented with abdominal pain, nausea, and an enlarged uterus. Attempted endometrial biopsy was unsuccessful. Cytology and HPV tests 9 months earlier were negative. Hysterectomy revealed a cervical squamous carcinoma. In case 2, a 40-year-old woman followed conservatively after excision of endocervical adenocarcinoma in situ had 5 follow-up cytology and HPV co-tests. All were HPV negative. Elective hysterectomy revealed cervical adenocarcinoma. Both carcinomas tested HPV positive.
CONCLUSIONS: Cervical stenosis in women developing cervical cancer can cause misleading sampling and false-negative HPV test results.
