Title: Rejoining Veins for Forced Maturation of Small-Caliber Arteriovenous Fistula.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the efficacy of rejoining mainstream and accessory veins for forced maturation of autogenous arteriovenous fistula (AVF).
METHODS: Twenty-three patients who underwent forced maturation through vein rejoining between January 2018 and September 2022 were included. In cases where AVF maturation failure due to the presence of accessory veins, rejoining was primarily considered when distinguishing the main branch becomes challenging. This difficulty typically occurs when the sizes of the 2 vessels are nearly equal and the combined diameters of these veins exceed 6 mm.
RESULTS: The mean age and follow-up duration were 57.39 ± 16.22 years and 965.65 ± 573.42 days, respectively. Rejoining of both arterial and venous cannulation sites was performed in 11 patients (47.8%), and rejoining of only the venous cannulation site or only the arterial cannulation site was performed in 11 patients (47.8%) and 1 patient (4.3%), respectively. The mean vein size was 0.35 ± 0.06 cm before rejoining and 0.69 ± 0.07 cm after surgery, indicating a significant increase in size (P < 0.01), whereas the flow did not change significantly following rejoining surgery. Maturation and cannulation success was 100%. The 1-year primary patency rate after surgery was 82.0%. During the follow-up period, 34.8% of the patients required additional percutaneous transluminal angioplasty to maintain patency, and 2 patients (11.8%) had stenosis in the rejoined section.
CONCLUSIONS: Rejoining surgery is an effective method for achieving AVF maturation in patients with accessory veins when identification of the mainstream vein is difficult, and this method may be considered when achieving maturation by sacrificing 1 vein is expected to be challenging.
