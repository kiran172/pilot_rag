Title: T-tube implantation combined with cricoid cartilage reconstruction in the treatment of congenital laryngeal webs with subglottic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To discuss the presentation, evaluation, and management of congenital laryngeal webs with subglottic stenosis.
METHODS: The clinical data of six children were retrospectively analyzed.
RESULTS: The median age of these children who came to our hospital was 14 months (range 1-26 months). A tracheotomy was performed in all these six children. The median age of the patients who underwent tracheotomy was 4 months (range 1-11 months). The surgical method was T-tube implantation combined with cricoid cartilage reconstruction. The median age of these patients at the time of operation was 22 months (range 13-35 months). The T-tube remained in place for 3-8 months, with a median time of 6 months. The tracheal tubes in all these children were successfully removed. All patients were followed up for more than 2 years without recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Children who have congenital laryngeal webs with subglottic stenosis required early tracheotomy. Open laryngoplasty combined with T-tube implantation and cricoid cartilage reconstruction may play a crucial role in the treatment of these children.
