Title: Echocardiographic and Angiographic Assessment of Right Ventricular Function and Right Coronary Artery Stenosis in Acute Inferior Wall Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a global concern. CVD remains a primary cause of death despite reduced coronary heart disease death rates. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) involves myocardial infarction (MI) and unstable angina, sharing mechanisms such as plaque instability. Our study assesses the right ventricular (RV) function's predictive value in acute inferior wall MI (IWMI) to identify high-risk patients with an elevated likelihood of experiencing severe cardiac complications, hemodynamic instability, or a higher mortality risk following an acute IWMI.
METHODOLOGY: The research was conducted in the Department of Cardiology at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi, from July 2021 to June 2022, following the necessary ethical approval. A cohort of 140 patients with IWMI, carefully chosen according to rigorous criteria, clearly understood the study's objectives before providing informed consent. The evaluations were conducted in the following order: clinical assessments, followed by blood testing, then echocardiography, and finally, coronary angiography. Furthermore, the study examined risk factors and utilized statistical methods to elucidate the associations between qualities and results.
RESULTS: The study included 140 participants, with 61% being male and 39% female. Among the participants, 14% were aged 30-45, 50% were aged 46-60, and 30% were over 60. Age shows significant proportions in different categories. Diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and smoking/tobacco addiction did not differ among stenosis groups. Proximal right coronary artery (RCA) stenosis patients had elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). The echocardiograms were performed within 48 hours of post-percutaneous coronary intervention, and significant differences between groups were observed. Participants with proximal stenosis had lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and right ventricular fractional area change (RVFAC), which showed compromised RV systolic function. Proximal stenosis patients had reduced systolic motion velocity (Sm), indicating impaired myocardial contraction. Echocardiographic parameters such as early diastolic velocity (Em), atrial contraction velocity (Am), Em/Am ratio (a marker of diastolic function), isovolumic relaxation time (IVRT), isovolumic contraction time (IVCT), and ejection time (ET) between groups were different, indicating distinct cardiac functions. Proximal stenosis increased the myocardial performance index (MPI), indicating cardiac impairment. The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was comparable in the two stenosis groups, indicating similar left ventricular performance.
CONCLUSION:  Echocardiography showed significant RV function differences in acute inferior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients with proximal and distal RCA lesions. RV dysfunction is linked to right ventricle myocardial infarction (RVMI), and echocardiographic markers can provide valuable insights. Results emphasize that acute inferior wall STEMI is diagnosed by electrocardiogram (ECG) criteria, particularly ST-segment elevation. However, these markers emphasize the importance of RV assessment in RCA involvement assessment. These findings suggest that RV function can help diagnose acute inferior wall STEMI RCA involvement. In acute inferior STEMIs, RV function echocardiography is essential for RCA lesion location.
