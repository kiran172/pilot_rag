Title: Predictors of Early and Late Atrioventricular Block Requiring Permanent Pacemaker Implantation After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Complete heart block requiring permanent pacemaker can occur early following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to mechanical compression of the aortic valve annulus and associated atrio-ventricular (AV) conduction system. Data are limited regarding late PM implantation after TAVR. The purpose of this study was to determine predictors of early vs. late PM implantation post-TAVR procedure.
METHODS: Baseline characteristics of patients who required PM <7 days following TAVR were compared with patients who required a PM >7 days to 1 year following TAVR using Chi-Square and multivariate regression analysis.
RESULTS: There were 362 TAVR patients, of which 39 (10.4%) received a PM after TAVR. Of these 18 (4.6%) patients required PM within 7 days after TAVR, and 21 (5.8%) required PM after 7 days and up to 1 year later. Right bundle branch block (RBBB) (OR 6.721, CI 2.3-36.9, p < 0.005) was a positive predictor of early PM placement. Left bundle branch block (LBBB) (OR = 3.5, CI 1.19-10.80, p-value < 0.05) and atrial fibrillation (AF) (OR = 3.5, 1.36-9.4 p < 0.05) were predictors for late PM. Early and late PM were associated with a longer median hospital stay compared to no PM (4.9 ± 4.86 days vs. 10.1 ± 10.04 days vs. 6.10 ± 6.02 days). The incidence of heart failure was higher in the late PM group. The overall motility was not increased in early and late PM compared to no PM.
CONCLUSION: Patients requiring PM implant after TAVR was 10.4%, of which 5.8% need PM >7 days post-TAVR. RBBB is a predictor for early PM. AF and LBBB were predictors for late PM.
