Title: Atrial myxoma: A cause for concern in multiple cerebral infarctions in absence of cardiac symptoms.

Abstract: Ischaemic cerebral infarct is the most common neurological manifestation of myxomas. We present a mid-70s man who was brought to the stroke unit with sudden onset right hemiparesis and dysarthria. Although he had risk factors for developing stroke like hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, history of prostate cancer and new paroxysmal atrial flutter on admission, clinical suspicion and detailed investigations in the absence of cardiac symptoms revealed a 9â€‰cm myxoma causing severe mitral stenosis. He underwent successful surgical resection with good functional recovery. This also highlights the need for thorough clinical examination especially in the absence of cardiac symptoms.
