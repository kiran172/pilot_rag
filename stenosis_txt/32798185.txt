Title: Mitral annular calcification in the elderly - Quantitative assessment.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the reliability of subjective and objective quantification of mitral annular calcification (MAC) in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis, to define quantitative sex- and age-related reference values of MAC, and to correlate quantitative MAC with mitral valve disease.
METHODS: In this retrospective, IRB-approved study, we included 559 patients (268 females, median age 81 years, inter-quartile range 77-85 years) with severe aortic stenosis undergoing CT. Four independent readers performed subjective MAC categorization as follows: no, mild, moderate, and severe MAC. Two independent readers performed quantitative evaluation of MAC using the Agatston score method (Agatston<sub>MAC</sub>). Mitral valve disease was determined by echocardiography.
RESULTS: Subjective MAC categorization showed high inter-reader agreement for no (k ​= ​0.88) and severe MAC (k ​= ​0.75), whereas agreement for moderate (k ​= ​0.59) and mild (k ​= ​0.45) MAC was moderate. Intra-reader agreement for subjective MAC categorization was substantial (k ​= ​0.69 and 0.62). Inter- and intra-reader agreement for Agatston<sub>MAC</sub> were excellent (ICC ​= ​0.998 and 0.999, respectively), with minor inconsistencies in MAC involving the left ventricular outflow tract/aortic valve. There were significantly more women than men with MAC (n ​= ​227, 85% versus n ​= ​209, 72%; p ​&lt; ​0.001), with a significantly higher Agatston<sub>MAC</sub> (median 597, range 81-2055 versus median 244; range 0-1565; p ​&lt; ​0.001), particularly in patients ≥85 years of age. Agatston<sub>MAC</sub> showed an area-under-the-curve of 0.84 to diagnose mitral stenosis, whereas there was no association of Agatston<sub>MAC</sub> with mitral regurgitation (p ​&gt; ​0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study in elderly patients with severe aortic stenosis shows that quantitative MAC scoring is more reliable than subjective MAC assessment. Women show higher Agatston<sub>MAC</sub> scores than men, particularly in the elderly population. Agatston<sub>MAC</sub> shows high accuracy to diagnose mitral stenosis.
