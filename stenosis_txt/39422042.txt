Title: More severe cerebral small vessel disease associated with poor leptomeningeal collaterals in symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.

Abstract: We investigated the association between cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) and ipsilateral leptomeningeal collateral (LMC) status in patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (sICAS). In 108 patients with 50-99% symptomatic intracranial internal carotid artery or M1 middle cerebral artery stenosis, 4 CSVD imaging markers (lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, enlarged perivascular spaces [EPVSs], and white matter hyperintensities [WMHs]) were assessed in MRI. Score of 0 or 1 was assigned to each marker and added up as a summary CSVD score (ranging 0-4) to reflect an overall CSVD burden. Ipsilateral LMC status was assessed by determining the laterality of distal vessels in anterior and posterior cerebral artery territories on CT angiography. Moderate-to-severe EPVSs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 4.15; p = 0.031) and WMHs (aOR = 5.90; p = 0.010), and higher summary CSVD score (aOR = 1.66; p = 0.030) were independently associated with poor LMCs. There was significant interaction between stenosis percentage in sICAS and summary CSVD score on poor LMCs (p = 0.022 for interaction), when higher CSVD score was significantly associated with poor LMCs in patients with severe sICAS (aOR = 2.84; p = 0.011) but not in those with moderate sICAS. The findings indicated possibly adverse effect of CSVD on the recruitment or development of LMCs in sICAS patients, especially in patients with severe sICAS.
