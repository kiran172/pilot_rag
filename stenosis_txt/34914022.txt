Title: Duodenal stenosis associated with an ectopic opening of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ectopic opening of the common bile duct is a rare congenital biliary anomaly. Herein, we present a case of duodenal stenosis with ectopic opening of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 54-year-old man was referred with fever, nausea, and vomiting. He had experienced epigastric pain several times over the past 30Â years. Endoscopy showed a post-bulbar ulcer, a submucosal tumor of the duodenum, and a small opening with bile secretion. Contrast duodenography revealed duodenal stenosis and bile reflux with a common bile duct deformity. Pancreatoduodenectomy was performed because of the clinical suspicion of a biliary neoplasm or groove pancreatitis. The resected specimen showed an ectopic opening of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb and no tumor.
CONCLUSIONS: Ectopic opening of the common bile duct into the duodenal bulb is complicated by a duodenal ulcer, deformity, and stenosis mimicking groove pancreatitis or pancreatic tumors. Although rare, we should be aware of this anomaly for an accurate diagnosis.
