Title: Racial and ethnic differences in presentation severity and postoperative outcomes in vascular surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We assessed the effect of race and ethnicity on presentation severity and postoperative outcomes in those with abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), carotid artery stenosis (CAS), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), and type B aortic dissection (TBAD).
METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until December 2020. Two reviewers independently selected randomized controlled trials and observational studies reporting race and/or ethnicity and presentation severity and/or postoperative outcomes for adult patients who had undergone major vascular procedures. They independently extracted the study data and assessed the risk of bias using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. The meta-analysis used random effects models to derive the odds ratios (ORs) and risk ratios (RRs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The primary outcome was presentation severity stratified by the proportion of patients with advanced disease, including ruptured vs nonruptured AAA, symptomatic vs asymptomatic CAS, chronic limb-threatening ischemia vs claudication, and complicated vs uncomplicated TBAD. The secondary outcomes included postoperative all-cause mortality and disease-specific outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 81 studies met the inclusion criteria. Black (OR, 4.18; 95% CI, 1.31-13.26), Hispanic (OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.85-2.19), and Indigenous (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.39-2.80) patients were more likely to present with ruptured AAAs than were White patients. Black and Hispanic patients had had higher symptomatic CAS (Black: OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.04-1.38; Hispanic: OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.20-1.45) and chronic limb-threatening ischemia (Black: OR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.14-2.43; Hispanic: OR, 1.73; 95% CI 1.13-2.65) presentation rates. No study had evaluated the effect of race or ethnicity on complicated TBAD. All-cause mortality was higher for Black (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.51), Hispanic (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.57-2.31), and Indigenous (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.12-1.37) patients after AAA repair. Postoperatively, Black (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.19-2.00) and Hispanic (RR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.31-1.81) patients were associated with stroke/transient ischemic attack after carotid revascularization and lower extremity amputation (RR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.76-2.06; and RR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.48-1.94, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Certain visible minorities were associated with higher morbidity and mortality across various vascular surgery presentations. Further research to understand the underpinnings is required.
