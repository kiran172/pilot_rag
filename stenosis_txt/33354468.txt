Title: An Interesting Case of a Cold Left Arm.

Abstract: Inter-arm variability in blood pressure readings typically signifies arterial disease between the aortic arch and the subclavian artery. The differential diagnosis includes thoracic aortic dissection, atherosclerosis, thoracic outlet syndrome, and subclavian artery stenosis and thrombosis. In patients with prior coronary artery bypass grafting, including the internal mammary artery, several of those conditions can compromise coronary blood flow and lead to myocardial ischemia. Here we discuss a case of left subclavian artery thrombosis, which compromised left internal mammary artery blood flow and led to ischemic ventricular tachycardia.
