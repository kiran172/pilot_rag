Title: [Review on diagnostic criteria of hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome].

Abstract: Hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (HSOS) is a kind of hepatic vascular disease which is characterized by damage to hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells, centrilobular hepatic vein and/or interlobular vein, resulting in stenosis or lumen occlusion, hepatic injury and acute sinusoidal portal hypertension. Generally, most patients with HSOS have mild manifestations, but in severely ill patients, the disease can lead to multiple organ dysfunction/failure, and the mortality rate can be as high as 70%-80%. Therefore, it is important to identify and treat HSOS as soon as possible. This paper introduces the current clinical diagnostic criteria of HSOS, including the Modified Seattle and Baltimore Criteria along with "Nanjing Criteria", and reviews their characteristics, scope of application and limitations.
