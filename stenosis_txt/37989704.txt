Title: Recurrent Valve Frame Infolding in the 34mm Self-Expanding Medtronic Evolut Pro+ Transcatheter Valve System: A Single Centre Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Valve frame infolding (VFI) is a rare complication (1-3%) of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), which primarily occurs in large sized self-expanding valves. We report the incidence of VFI in a small group of patients with highly calcified and extra-large aortic annuli, who underwent implantation of the newer generation 34mm Medtronic Evolut Pro+ (EP+) valve system.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted on all patients presenting to a single centre experienced with TAVI in Sydney, NSW, Australia, between June and October 2022, for transfemoral TAVI using the Medtronic 34mm EP+ valve system. VFI was diagnosed using fluoroscopy, and pre-procedure computed tomography (CT) was analysed offline.
RESULTS: VFI occurred in four of 10 patients who underwent TAVI using the 34mm EP+ system. Between VFI and non-VFI patients, the annular size, aortic angulation and total calcium volume was similar. Calcium distribution between the coronary cusps was symmetrical in non-VFI patients (37%, 33% and 30%), compared to 52% in the non-coronary cusp (NCC) in VFI patients. The mean ellipticity index was higher in VFI versus non-VFI patients (22% vs 14%).
CONCLUSION: The 34mm Medtronic EP+ valve system is vital for safe and effective treatment of a niche subgroup of patients with extra-large annuli and extensive calcification, however operators should be aware of the increased incidence of VFI. Heavy eccentric calcification at the NCC, as well as using the cusp-overlap implant technique may exacerbate VFI, while multiplanar fluoroscopic screening may improve recognition.
