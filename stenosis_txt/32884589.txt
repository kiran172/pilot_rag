Title: Paclitaxel-coated drug-eluting balloon for pulmonary vein stenosis after repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return with asplenia.

Abstract: We used a paclitaxel-coated drug-eluting balloon (DEB) for pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) after repair of total anomalous pulmonary venous return with asplenia. No adverse effect of paclitaxel was revealed and plasma concentration of paclitaxel was not elevated after intervention. Although progression of PVS slowed after dilatation with the DEB, stenosis recurred relentlessly, resulting in patient demise. This strategy may be safe for infantile cases, but requires further effective strategy, such as usage of larger sizes of DEBs. &lt;Learning objective: Paclitaxel-coated drug-eluting balloons may be safely used for pulmonary vein stenosis after total anomalous pulmonary venous return repair in an infant with asplenia. However, their effectiveness is still limited.&gt;.
