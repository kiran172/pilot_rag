Title: Is routine post-sleeve gastrografin needed? Profile of 98 cases.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is one of the most commonly performed bariatric procedures. Some surgeons still perform routine post-sleeve gastrografin (RSG) study believing that it would detect post-LSG complications, especially leak. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of RSG by considering the cost of the study, length of hospital stay and complications-related costs RSG could prevent.
RESULTS: A total of 98 eligible patients were included. Of them, 54 patients underwent RSG and 44 did not. Excluding the cost of LSG procedure, the average cost for those who underwent RSG and those who did not in Saudi Riyal (£) was 5193.15 (1054.77) and 4222.27 (857.58), respectively. The average length of stay (ALOS) was practically the same regardless of whether or not the patient underwent RSG. 90.8% (n = 89) of all patients stayed for 3 days. None of the patients developed postoperative bleeding, stenosis or leak. The mean weight, body mass index (BMI) and percentage weight loss (PWL) 6 months postoperatively were found to be 87.71 kg (SD = 17.51), 33.89 kg/m2 (SD = 7.29) and 26.41% (SD = 9.79), respectively. The PWL 6 months postoperatively was 23.99% (SD = 8.47) for females and 30.57 (SD = 10.6) for males (p = 0.01).
