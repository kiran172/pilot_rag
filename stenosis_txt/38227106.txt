Title: Upper partial sternal split for pediatric cardiac surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We introduced the use of an upper partial sternal split for pediatric cardiac surgical procedures in our unit in 2016. We report the outcomes of our experience in 51 patients using this approach.
METHODS: From February 2016 to September 2022, 51 patients underwent congenital cardiac surgical procedures using an upper partial sternal split including vascular ring repair (n = 20), subaortic membrane (n = 12), ventricular septal defect closure with aortic valve resuspension (n = 9), aortic arch repair (n = 4), pulmonary artery band (n = 2), pulmonary artery sling (n = 1), supravalvular aortic stenosis (n = 1), aortic valve replacement (n = 1), and pulmonary artery plasty (n = 1). The surgical approach involved a midline skin incision, based on the manubrium, followed by an upper manubriotomy. No special surgical instrumentation was required. Median patient age was 2.9 years (IQR 1.3, 6.0); median body weight was 15 kg (IQR 9.8, 20).
RESULTS: There was no mortality and no patient required intraoperative conversion to full sternotomy. One patient required re-exploration for bleeding when the incision was converted to a full sternotomy. There were no wound complications in any patient. Twenty-one patients (41%) were extubated on the table and of the remaining 30 patients, 23 patients (76%) were extubated within 24 h of surgery. Eleven patients did not require intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Median ICU and hospital stay was 1 day (IQR 1, 1.25) and 5 days (IQR 4, 8) ,respectively.
CONCLUSION: An upper partial sternal split approach is straightforward and can be performed safely with a preferable cosmetic result in selected pediatric cardiac operations.
