Title: Pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation in patients with acute aortic dissection based on coronary computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Periaortic fat is associated with coronary disease. Thus, it was hypothesized that the inflammation associated with acute aortic dissection (AAD) spreads to pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) via thoracic periaortic fat. Pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation (PCATa) serves as a marker for inflammation of perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT). This study sought to examine PCATa in individuals diagnosed with AAD.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with chest pain from May 2020 to September 2022 were prospectively enrolled in this study and underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and/or aorta computed tomography angiography (CTA). Based on the results of the CTA, the patients were divided into the following two groups: (I) the AAD group; and (II) the non-AAD group. PCATa of the right coronary angiography (RCA), left anterior descending (LAD), and left circumflex (LCx) was quantified for each patient using semi-automated software. The PCATa values were compared between the AAD and non-AAD patients according to the atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries. Similarly, the PCATa values of the AAD patients were compared between the preoperative and postoperative steady states.
RESULTS: A total of 136 patients (42 female, 94 male; mean age: 63.3±11.9 years) were divided into the two groups according to the presence of aortic dissection on CTA. The RCA<sub>PCATa</sub>, LAD<sub>PCATa</sub>, and LCx<sub>PCATa</sub> values were significantly higher in the AAD subjects than the non-AAD subjects, regardless of the presence or absence of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries [-85.1±9.3 vs. -92.9±10.0 Hounsfield unit (HU); -83.2±7.4 vs. -89.9±9.1 HU; -77.5±8.4 vs. -85.6±7.9 HU, all P&lt;0.001). The preoperative RCA<sub>PCATa</sub>, LAD<sub>PCATa</sub>, and LCx<sub>PCATa</sub> values were higher in the AAD patients than the postoperative steady-state patients (-82.9±8.7 vs. -97.6±8.8 HU; -79.8±7.6 vs. -92.8±6.8 HU; -74.6±7.1 vs. -87.7±6.9 HU, all P&lt;0.001). According to the multivariable logistic regression analysis, high RCA<sub>PCATa</sub> and LAD<sub>PCATa</sub> values were associated with AAD regardless of the degree of stenosis [odds ratio (OR) =0.014; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.001-0.177; P=0.001 and OR =0.010; 95% CI: 0.001-0.189; P=0.002].
CONCLUSIONS: PCATa on computed tomography was increased in patients with AAD regardless of the presence or absence of coronary artery disease (CAD). This suggests that vascular inflammation is present in AAD independent of CAD. Further research should be conducted to investigate the potential of this imaging biomarker to predict AAD and monitor patients' responses to therapies for AAD.
