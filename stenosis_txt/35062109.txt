Title: A-Test Method for Quantifying Structural Risk and Learning Capacity of Supervised Machine Learning Methods.

Abstract: This paper presents an original method for studying the performance of the supervised Machine Learning (ML) methods, the A-Test method. The method offers the possibility of investigating the structural risk as well as the learning capacity of ML methods in a quantitating manner. A-Test provides a powerful validation method for the learning methods with small or medium size of the learning data, where overfitting is regarded as a common problem of learning. Such a condition can occur in many applications of bioinformatics and biomedical engineering in which access to a large dataset is a challengeable task. Performance of the A-Test method is explored by validation of two ML methods, using real datasets of heart sound signals. The datasets comprise of children cases with a normal heart condition as well as 4 pathological cases: aortic stenosis, ventricular septal defect, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary stenosis. It is observed that the A-Test method provides further comprehensive and more realistic information about the performance of the classification methods as compared to the existing alternatives, the K-fold validation and repeated random sub-sampling.
