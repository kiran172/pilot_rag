Title: BK polyomavirus diversity-Why viral variation matters.

Abstract: BK polyomavirus (BKPyV or BKV) is a non-enveloped, circular double-stranded DNA virus that may exceed 80% seroprevalence in adults. BKV infection typically occurs during childhood, and the majority of adults are latently infected. While BKV infection is rarely associated with clinical disease in most individuals, in immunosuppressed individuals, reactivation may cause kidney (BK-associated nephropathy) or bladder (hemorrhagic cystitis and ureteral stenosis) injury. No antiviral therapies have been approved for the treatment of BKV infection. Reducing immunosuppression is the most effective therapy, although this is not feasible in many patients. Thus, a robust understanding of viral pathogenesis and viral diversity remains important for the development of future therapeutic strategies. Studies of BKV diversity are quite sparse compared to other common viral infections; thus, much of our understanding of BVK variability and evolution relies heavily analogous studies of other viruses such as HIV or viral hepatitis. We provide a comprehensive review of BKV diversity at the population and individual level with careful consideration of how viral variability may impact viral replication, pathogenesis, tropism, and protein function. We also discuss a number of outstanding questions related to BK virus diversity that should be explored rigorously in future studies.
