Title: [A comparative analysis of the clinical and anamnestic status of patients with chronic occlusion of the carotid arteries based on the data of observational registries].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical and anamnestic status of patients with chronic carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) based on the analysis of risk factors, demographic and clinical and anatomical characteristics, the dynamics of the disease; to evaluate ongoing drug therapy, the incidence of strokes (MI) and deaths (according to the local registry compared with the results of other observational studies).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed and eLibrary searches for a systematic review were performed from October 24 to December 10, 2021 independently by two investigators. Out of 870 articles, based on inclusion/exclusion criteria, 8 studies were selected and included in the systematic review.
RESULTS: A comparative analysis of the clinical and anamnestic status of patients with CCAO according to the present review showed the following data on the prevalence of the main risk factors/diseases: hypertension - 79.1%; male gender - 83.7%; smoking - 46%; diabetes mellitus - 30.5%. Of the entire of own Duplex registry group (n=2548), 7 patients were identified with CCAO (0.27%). All patients were male (mean age 71.3Â±9.4 years). Endpoints were recorded in 5 of 7 participants during the follow-up period (8.9 years): 5 deaths, 2 fatal MI, 1 non-fatal MI, 1 myocardial infarction. A significant impact of the fact of MI on the survival of patients was confirmed using the standard log-rank test (p=0.02 and the Cox-Mendel test (p=0.04). The incidence of MI during the prospective follow-up according to the analyzed studies ranged from 4.3% (within a month of follow-up) to 42.8% (with a follow-up of 8.9 years), and averaged 12%.
CONCLUSIONS: A comparative analysis of the clinical and anamnestic status of patients with CCAO based on data from observational registers showed that the probability of detecting this pathology is associated with age and male gender. Data obtained from prospective observation of patients with CCAO in our own study show that the development of MI is one of the main factors affecting the survival of this category of patients.
