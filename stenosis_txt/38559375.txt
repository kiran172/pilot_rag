Title: Transcarotid arterial revascularization is feasible and safe with concomitant inferior vena cava occlusion.

Abstract: Transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) has risen as a promising minimally invasive intervention for high-risk patients with favorable anatomy. TCAR's noninferiority to carotid endarterectomy regarding stroke is reliant on its flow reversal technology and lack of aortic arch manipulation. We present the case of a 79-year-old man with a chronically occluded inferior vena cava who safely underwent staged bilateral TCAR for bilateral high-grade carotid artery stenosis. Although chronic inferior vena cava occlusion alters flow mechanics, we suspect that any pressure gradient facilitating retrograde flow from the carotid artery to the femoral vein provides neuroprotective benefits.
