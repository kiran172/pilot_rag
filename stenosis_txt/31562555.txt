Title: Myocardial bridging is an independent predictor of positive spasm provocation testing by intracoronary ergonovine injections: a retrospective observational study.

Abstract: The relationship between myocardial bridging (MB) and coronary spasms during spasm provocation testing (SPT) remains unclear. We aimed to investigate whether MB was correlated with the SPT by ergonovine (ER) injections in a retrospective observational study. Of the 3340 patients who underwent a first coronary angiography, 166 underwent SPT using ER injections and were divided into 2 groups: MB(+) (n = 23), and MB(-) (n = 143). MB was defined as an angiographic reduction in the diameter of the coronary artery during systole. The patients who had severe organic stenosis in the left anterior descending coronary artery were excluded. The MB(+) group more frequently had diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, and a thicker interventricular septum thickness. The rate of SPT-positivity was higher in the MB(+) group than MB(-) group (56.5% vs. 22.4%, P = 0.001). A multivariate regression analysis showed that the presence of MB was independently associated with SPT-positivity (odds ratio 5.587, 95% confidence interval 2.061-15.149, P = 0.001). In conclusion, coronary spasms during provocation tests with ER independently correlated with the MB. MB may predict coronary spasms.
