Title: EUS-guided jejunoduodenostomy: another option for the management of stenosis in hepaticojejunoanastomosis.

Abstract: Our case report describes a patient with recurrent stenoses in both the right and left hepaticojejunoanastomoses due to an injury to the bile ducts during cholecystectomy several years ago. The anastomoses could not be reached endoscopically.  EUS-guided hepaticogastrostomy would be a solution only for the left hepatic duct anastomosis. As the patient refused percutaneous transhepatic drainage (PTD) of both intrahepatic ducts and dilation of both anastomoses, endoscopic ultrasound-guided jejunoduodenostomy was performed using a lumen apposing metal stent (LAMS). This method provides repeated endoscopic access to the anastomoses of both hepatic ducts, allowing for their treatment.
