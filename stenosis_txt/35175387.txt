Title: [Anesthesiological aspects in patients with epidermolysis bullosa].

Abstract: Epidermolysis bullosa causes blistering due to altered structural proteins of the dermoepidermal junction, resulting in scarring and strictures of the skin and mucous membranes. Affected individuals typically require frequent surgical interventions due to burdensome symptoms and complications of the disease. The anesthesiological management of these patients is inherently challenging. This review article summarizes the relevant features of this patient cohort and provides practical recommendations for care.
