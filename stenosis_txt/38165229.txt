Title: Performance of biliary stents in malignant biliary strictures.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic stenting is a commonly applied method of treatment in patients with malignant biliary strictures. It involves the use of self‑expandable metal stents (SEMSs) or plastic stents (PSs).
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of SEMSs and PSs in the endoscopic drainage of malignant strictures of the biliary tree and its sequels for future optimalization of this treatment method.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on 618 consecutive patients with malignant biliary stricture, in whom 1271endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography procedures with biliary stenting have been performed in the years 2012-2017 with at least 3‑year follow‑up,  were retrospectively derived from a hospital database.
RESULTS: The main indications for stenting were pancreatic cancer (37%) and cholangiocarcinoma (34%). The use of SEMSs resulted in a greater decline of serum bilirubin as compared with PSs (37% vs 32% of baseline concentration; P = 0.01). Consequently, hospital stay was shorter by more than 2 days (mean [SD], 9.5 [5.6] vs 11.8 [7.9] days; P <0.001). The median (interquartile range) patency time of SEMSs was more than 2 times longer than for PSs (118 [56-232] days vs 46 [18-97] days; P <0.001), and procedure‑related complications were less frequent (19.3% vs 12.9%, respectively in the SEMS and PS group; P = 0.001). SEMSs proved also to be more cost‑effective; the hospital profit was 1375 USD for a single hospitalization with SEMS insertion.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with malignant strictures of the biliary tree SEMSs outperform PSs. SEMSs should be used as a treatment of choice for biliary drainage in that group of patients.
