Title: Early Combined Immunosuppression Reduces Complications in Long-standing Crohn's Disease: A Post Hoc Analysis of REACT.

Abstract: Crohn's disease (CD) can lead to bowel damage, stricturing, and obstruction thereby resulting in surgery and hospitalization. The Randomized Evaluation of an Algorithm for Crohn's Treatment (REACT) trial showed that early combined immunosuppression (ECI) with symptom-based treatment escalation for 24 months resulted in a lower risk of surgery, hospitalization, or CD-related complications compared with conventional management (CM).1 Treatment earlier in the disease course may be associated with reduced risk of complications compared with later initiation, although data are sparse.2 We performed a post hoc analysis of REACT to evaluate the impact of baseline disease duration on surgery, hospitalization, or CD-related complications in patients treated with ECI compared with CM.
