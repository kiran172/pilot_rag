Title: Solitary osteochondroma of dorsal spine causing canal stenosis with myelopathy - A case report with review of literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Osteochondroma is a common benign tumor arising from the long bones. It rarely arises in the spine, where it can cause mild symptoms such as backache all the way up to compressive myelopathy. Malignant transformation has also been reported. Here, the authors present a 52-year-old male with myelopathy attributed to a rare thoracic solitary osteochondroma.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 52-year-old male presented back pain radiating into both lower extremities with paresthesia to the toes of 1 year's duration. On examination, he exhibited hyperactive bilateral lower extremity reflexes with bilateral Babinski signs, and focal sensory changes to pin, and touch appreciation in the left L5S1 distributions. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal bony mass arising from the posterior arch of T10 with protrusion into the spinal canal resulting in marked canal/cord compression. Surgery included a D10 laminectomy with en bloc resection of the lesion. Postoperatively, the patient's symptoms resolved. Histologically, the lesion was an osteochondroma.
CONCLUSION: When patients present with myelopathy, one should include osteochondromas among the differential diagnostic possibilities.
