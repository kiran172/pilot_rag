Title: Comparison of Access Route for Endovascular Treatment by Time-Spatial Labeling Inversion Pulse (Time-SLIP) MRA and Contrast-Enhanced MRA.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: In endovascular treatment, it is important to evaluate the access route for placing a catheter into the common carotid artery (CCA) promptly and safely prior to the procedure. We examined whether non-contrast MRA using time-spatial labeling inversion pulse (Time-SLIP) can be used in patients prior to endovascular thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke. We compared Time-SLIP MRA to contrast-enhanced (CE) MRA and evaluated the efficacy in the evaluation of access routes.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 31 patients admitted between October 2018 and December 2018 for cerebral infarction at our hospital. Blood vessels were imaged from the aortic arch to the CCA. A radiologist blindly evaluated quality score, stenosis, shape of the aorta, and degree of tortuosity.
RESULTS: There were no "non-diagnostic" images. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for stenosis were 83%, 96%, 83%, and 96%, respectively. The sensitivity for the aorta type classification was 100%. The sensitivity for mild tortuosity was 93%, for moderate was 100%, and for severe was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Time-SLIP MRA can be an alternative to CE MRA in access route assessment for patients with cerebral infarction who are not eligible for acute thrombectomy therapy.
