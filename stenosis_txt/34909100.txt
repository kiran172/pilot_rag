Title: Malignant hypertension secondary to iliac artery stenosis after kidney transplantation: a case report.

Abstract: Iliac artery stenosis is a rare complication after renal transplantation. This complication affects elderly patients and related to atheromatous disease. It mimics the same clinical presentation as a transplant renal artery stenosis or renal artery stenosis. This entity is can be responsible for serious complications such as renal dysfunction, malignant hypertension and acute pulmonary oedema. We present in this paper the case of a 51-year-old patient, who benefited 7 years early of renal transplantation, with a good initial result, and who was admitted actually for malignant hypertension and renal function impairment due to an iliac artery stenosis proximal to the renal transplant and who was treated with a stenting angioplasty of the external iliac artery with a mixed outcome. Our case highlights the importance of the early diagnosis and treatment of such complications to avoid definitive renal failure and permanent hypertension.
