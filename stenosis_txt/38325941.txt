Title: Pulmonary Hypertension in Established Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia: Physiologic Approaches to Clinical Care.

Abstract: Preterm infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) are prone to develop pulmonary hypertension (PH). Strong laboratory and clinical data suggest that antenatal factors, such as preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, oligohydramnios, and placental dysfunction leading to fetal growth restriction, increase susceptibility for BPD-PH after premature birth. Echocardiogram metrics and serial assessments of NT-proBNP provide useful tools to diagnose and monitor clinical course during the management of BPD-PH, as well as monitoring for such complicating conditions as left ventricular diastolic dysfunction, shunt lesions, and pulmonary vein stenosis. Therapeutic strategies should include careful assessment and management of underlying airways and lung disease, cardiac performance, and systemic hemodynamics, prior to initiation of PH-targeted drug therapies.
