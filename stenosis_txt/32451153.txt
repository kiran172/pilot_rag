Title: A novel double-balloon catheter for percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty under echocardiographic guidance only.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (PBPV) is the procedure of choice for uncomplicated severe or symptomatic pulmonary stenosis. Echocardiography (echo)-guided PBPV can completely avoid the use of radiation and contrast agents compared to fluoroscopy-guided PBPV. Although we have confirmed that echo-guided PBPV is feasible in humans, the poor visibility of the traditional catheter under echo greatly limits the promotion of this new technology.
METHODS: We produced a novel double-balloon catheter to make the catheter easy to be detected by echo through adding a guiding balloon at the distal end of the catheter. Echo-guided PBPV was performed on thirty healthy swine using either a novel catheter or a traditional catheter to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the novel double-balloon catheter. The feasibility was evaluated by the success rate of balloon inflation at the pulmonary valve annulus and the operating time. The safety was evaluated by the frequency of balloon slippage and the incidence of complications.
RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences in terms of weight and the ratio of balloon diameter to pulmonary annulus diameter. The success rate was 93.3% and 60% in the novel and traditional groups, respectively. The novel group had significantly (p<0.05) lower mean procedure time (6.33±6.86min vs 24.8±9.79min) and lower frequency of balloon slippage (0.07±0.26 vs 0.53±0.52), arrhythmia (0.07±0.26 vs 0.47±0.52), and tricuspid regurgitation (6.7% vs 40%) than the traditional group. No myocardial hematoma or pericardial tamponade occurred in the novel catheter group.
CONCLUSION: Although further studies and improvements are required, the study results indicate that the novel double-balloon catheter for echo-guided PBPV is feasible and safe.
