Title: Reliable and safe salivary duct repositioning technique with partial transection and intraductal stenting: Technical notes.

Abstract: Salivary duct repositioning is often performed after excision of malignant tumors or removal of sialoliths to maintain salivary function and minimize the risk of swelling or pain due to the obstruction of the gland. However, there is risk of intraoperative tissue damage due to traumatic manipulation, leading to stenosis; in addition, the small diameter of the duct also renders this procedure difficult. Recently, we improved our method of salivary duct repositioning as follows. In the first technique, partial transection is made on the lateral wall of the duct ligated with thread at the end. Pulling the thread provides a view of the lumen, and appropriate tension enables a reliable and non-invasive procedure without requiring the operator to grasp the edge of the duct directly. When the diameter of the duct is small, intraductal stenting, the second technique, can be combined with the former technique by probe insertion to expand the lumen. Our approach is technically easy and simple which can be accepted by any clinicians and it could also be a promising technique that can serve as a less invasive and effective treatment.
