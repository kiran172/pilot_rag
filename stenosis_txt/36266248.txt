Title: Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: Review Update 2022.

Abstract: Patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) may experience neuropathic symptoms, such as back pain, radiating pain, and neurogenic claudication. Although the long-term outcomes of both nonsurgical and surgical treatments are similar, surgery may provide shortterm benefits, including improved symptoms and lower risk of falling. Decompression is mainly used for surgical treatment, and depending on the decompression degree and associated instability, combination therapy may be given. Minimally invasive surgery has been demonstrated to produce excellent results in the treatment of LSS. Thus, an approach aimed at understanding the overall pathophysiology and treatment methods of LSS is expected to have a better therapeutic effect.
