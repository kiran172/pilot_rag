Title: Saccular "Cauliflower" aneurysm of coarctation of aorta: a hybrid management.

Abstract: Aneurysm formation around the site of coarctation of aortic arch is a well-recognised complication of untreated coarctation and is associated with an increased risk of aortic rupture and mortality. We present a rare case in a teenage girl with the combination of significant aortic arch coarctation, a "cauliflower-like" saccular aneurysm, and stenosis at the origin of the left subclavian artery. She was successfully managed with a hybrid approach, which is a combination of an endovascular surgical repair (a bypass graft placement from left carotid artery to subclavian artery by a vascular surgeon) and a transcatheter covered stent placement across the stenosis and aneurysm. This case highlights the successful role of a hybrid approach in patient's who present with a combination of coarctation of the aorta and aortic arch aneurysms. This approach avoids the conventional surgical aortoplasty, which carries a higher mortality and morbidity risk in teenage patients.
