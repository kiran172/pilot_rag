Title: Deferral of Coronary Revascularization in Patients With Reduced Ejection Fraction Based on Physiological Assessment: Impact on Long-Term Survival.

Abstract: Background Deferring revascularization in patients with nonsignificant stenoses based on fractional flow reserve (FFR) is associated with favorable clinical outcomes up to 15 years. Whether this holds true in patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction is unclear. We aimed to investigate whether FFR provides adjunctive clinical benefit compared with coronary angiography in deferring revascularization of patients with intermediate coronary stenoses and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction. Methods and Results Consecutive patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤50%) undergoing coronary angiography between 2002 and 2010 were screened. We included patients with at least 1 intermediate coronary stenosis (diameter stenosis ≥40%) in whom revascularization was deferred based either on angiography plus FFR (FFR guided) or angiography alone (angiography guided). The primary end point was the cumulative incidence of all-cause death at 10 years. The secondary end point (incidence of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events) was a composite of all-cause death, myocardial infarction, any revascularization, and stroke. A total of 840 patients were included (206 in the FFR-guided group and 634 in the angiography-guided group). Median follow-up was 7 years (interquartile range, 3.22-11.08 years). After 1:1 propensity-score matching, baseline characteristics between the 2 groups were similar. All-cause death was significantly lower in the FFR-guided group compared with the angiography-guided group (94 [45.6%] versus 119 [57.8%]; hazard ratio [HR], 0.65 [95% CI, 0.49-0.85]; P&lt;0.01). The rate of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events was lower in the FFR-guided group (123 [59.7%] versus 139 [67.5%]; HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.59-0.95]; P=0.02). Conclusions In patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, deferring revascularization of intermediate coronary stenoses based on FFR is associated with a lower incidence of death and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events at 10 years.
