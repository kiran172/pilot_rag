Title: [A Case in Which the Radial Incision and Cutting(RIC)Method Was Effective for Endoscopic Balloon Dilatation-Resistant Anastomotic Stenosis after Esophageal Cancer Surgery].

Abstract: In recent years, the radial incision and cutting(RIC)method has been developed as a treatment for intractable anastomotic stenosis after esophageal cancer surgery, and its usefulness is attracting attention. We report a case in which the RIC method was effective for endoscopic balloon dilatation-resistant anastomotic stenosis. The case was a 69-year-old woman. Transthoracic esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection, and narrow gastric tube reconstruction through antethoracic route, were performed for middle thoracic esophageal cancer. The patient suffered from Grade â…¢a anastomotic leakage, but was discharged relieved. After discharge, the patient needed regular endoscopic balloon dilation for against intractable anastomotic stenosis. RIC was performed for the patient. Although stenosis relapsed after the RIC, the pain during balloon dilatation improved and oral intake can be continued without surgery. The required interval of dilatation was about 2 weeks before RIC, but it has been gradually extended to about 4 weeks after 1 year after the RIC. Moreover, oral intake and body weight of the patient were increased. The RIC method may be useful for intractable anastomotic stenosis after esophageal cancer surgery, and further case accumulation is needed.
