Title: Novel Application of Milrinone in the Evaluation of Classical Low-Flow, Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: • Classical LFLG AS should be classified as either true-severe or pseudosevere AS. • DSE is the recognized imaging modality for making this distinction. • Milrinone at steady state may be considered in classical LFLG AS evaluation.
