Title: Sutureless Repair of Extracardiac Univentricular Total Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Connection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to evaluate the results of sutureless repair of extracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) with a functional single ventricle at a single institution, including changes in the anastomotic site over time.
METHODS: The database contained 98 patients with single-ventricle anatomy who underwent extracardiac TAPVC repair from 1996 to 2022. The median age and body weight at surgery were 59 days and 3.8 kg, respectively. Eighty-seven patients had heterotaxy syndrome, and 42 had preoperatively obstructed TAPVC. Primary sutureless repair was performed in 18 patients, 13 of whom were neonates. The cross-sectional area of the anastomotic site of the atrium and pericardium was divided by the body surface area, and the changes in this value over time were assessed. The median follow-up was 5.2 years (range, 0-19.4 years).
RESULTS: Operative mortality and late mortality occurred in 2 (2.0%) and 38 (38.8%) patients, respectively. The actuarial survival rate at 5 years postoperatively was 56.2%. Multivariate analysis identified preoperatively obstructed TAPVC as a risk factor for mortality. Recurrent pulmonary venous stenosis (PVS) developed in 25 patients, thus giving a 5-year rate of freedom from PVS of 64.9%. Multivariate analysis revealed that sutureless repair significantly decreased the incidence of recurrent PVS. The cross-sectional anastomotic area tended to grow in accordance with the patients' growth.
CONCLUSIONS: Sutureless repair of extracardiac TAPVC with univentricular anatomy achieved acceptable results. The anastomotic site tended to grow over time and contributed to a decline in the rate of recurrent PVS.
