Title: Depression and Subclinical Coronary Atherosclerosis in Adults Without Clinical Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The relationship between depression and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic individuals is not clear. We evaluated this relationship in a Korean population.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We analyzed 3920 individuals (mean age 54.7±7.9 years and 2603 men [66.4%]) with no history of coronary artery disease who voluntarily underwent coronary computed tomographic angiography and screening for depression using the Beck Depression Inventory as part of a general health examination. The degree and extent of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated by coronary computed tomographic angiography, and ≥50% diameter stenosis was defined as significant. Participants were categorized into groups of those with or without depression using the Beck Depression Inventory scores ≥16 as a cutoff value. Of the study participants, 272 (6.9%) had a Beck Depression Inventory score of 16 or higher. After adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors, depression was not significantly associated with any coronary plaque (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.05 [95% CI, 0.78-1.41]; P=0.746), calcified plaque (OR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.71-1.29]; P=0.758), noncalcified plaque (OR, 1.31 [95% CI, 0.79-2.17]; P=0.305), mixed plaque (OR, 1.16 [95% CI, 0.60-2.23]; P=0.659), or significant coronary artery stenosis (OR, 1.22 [95% CI, 0.73-2.03]; P=0.450). In the propensity score-matched population (n=1318) as well, none of the coronary artery disease measures of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis were statistically significantly associated with depression (all P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cross-sectional study with asymptomatic individuals undergoing coronary computed tomographic angiography and Beck Depression Inventory evaluation, depression was not associated with an increased risk of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis.
