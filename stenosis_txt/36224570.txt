Title: TCF7/SNAI2/miR-4306 feedback loop promotes hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hypertrophy of ligamentum flavum (HLF) is the mainly cause of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), but the precise mechanism of HLF formation has not been fully elucidated. Emerging evidence indicates that transcription factor 7 (TCF7) is the key downstream functional molecule of Wnt/Î²-catenin signaling, which participated in regulating multiple biological processes. However, the role and underlying mechanism of TCF7 in HLF is still unclear.
METHODS: We used mRNAs sequencing analysis of human LF and subsequent confirmation with RT-qPCR, western blot and immunohistochemistry to identified the TCF7 in HLF tissues and cells. Then effect of TCF7 on HLF progression was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, chromatin immunoprecipitation, dual-luciferase reporter assays, and rescue experiments were used to validate the regulation of TCF7/SNAI2/miR-4306 feedback loop.
RESULTS: Our results identified for first time that the TCF7 expression was obviously elevated in HLF tissues and cells compared with control, and also found that TCF7 expression had significant positive correlation with LF thickness and fibrosis score. Notably, TCF7 inhibition suppressed the hyper-proliferation and fibrosis phenotype of HLF cells in vitro and ameliorated progression of HLF in mice in vivo, whereas TCF7 overexpression promoted hyper-proliferation and fibrosis phenotype of HLF cells in vitro. Our data further revealed that TCF7 interacted with SNAI2 promoter to transactivated the SNAI2 expression, thereby promoting hyper-proliferation and fibrosis phenotype of HLF cells in vitro. Furthermore, miR-4036 negatively regulated by SNAI2 could negatively feedback regulate TCF7 expression by directly binding to TCF7 mRNA 3'-UTR, thus inhibiting the hyper-proliferation and fibrosis phenotype of HLF cells in vitro.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that TCF7 inhibition could suppress HLF formation by modulating TCF7/SNAI2/miR-4306 feedback loop, which might be considered as a novel potential therapeutic target for HLF.
