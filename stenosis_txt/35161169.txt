Title: Evaluation of Selected Properties of Sodium Alginate-Based Hydrogel Material-Mechanical Strength, μDIC Analysis and Degradation.

Abstract: The search for ideal solutions for the treatment of urethral stenosis continues. This includes developing the material, design, while maintaining its optimal and desired properties. This paper presents the results of the research conducted on sodium alginate-based hydrogel material (AHM), which may be used as a material for stents dedicated to the treatment of pathologies occurring in the genitourinary system. In order to determine the selected parameters of the AHM samples, strength and degradation tests, as well as analysis of the micro changes occurring on the surface of the material using a digital image correlation (µDIC) system, were performed. This study shows that the material possessed good mechanical strength parameters, the knowledge of which is particularly important from the point of view of the stent-tissue interaction. The degradation analysis performed showed that the AHM samples degrade in an artificial urine environment, and that the degradation time mainly depends on the chemical composition of the material. The novel µDIC method performed allowed us to characterize the homogeneity of the material structure depending on the cross-linking agent used.
