Title: Pulsed Field Ablation of Atrial Fibrillation: An Initial Australian Single-Centre Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pulsed field ablation (PFA) is a newer ablation energy source with the potential to reduce complications and improve efficacy compared to conventional thermal atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation. This study aimed to present an initial single-centre Australian experience of PFA for AF ablation.
METHODS: Initial consecutive patients undergoing PFA for paroxysmal or persistent AF at a single centre were included. Baseline patient characteristics, procedural data and clinical outcomes were collected prospectively at the time of the procedure. Patients were followed up at 3 months and 6-monthly thereafter.
RESULTS: In total, 100 PFA procedures were performed in 97 patients under general anaesthesia. All pulmonary veins (403 of 403) were successfully isolated acutely. Median follow-up was 218 days (range, 16-343 days), and the Kaplan-Meier estimate for freedom from atrial arrhythmias at 180 days was 87% (95% confidence interval 79%-95%). Median procedure time was 74 minutes (range, 48-134 minutes). Median fluoroscopy dose-area product was 345 μGym2 (interquartile range, 169-685 μGym2). Two (2%) pseudoaneurysm vascular access complications occurred. There were no cases of thromboembolic complications, stroke, phrenic nerve palsy, pulmonary vein stenosis, atrio-oesophageal fistula, or pericardial tamponade.
CONCLUSIONS: Pulsed field ablation can be performed safely and efficiently, with encouraging efficacy in early follow-up. Further data and clinical trials will be required to assess the comparative utility of PFA in contemporary AF ablation practice.
