Title: Burden of hospitalization during the first year following transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hospitalizations are a major burden for both patients and society but are potentially preventable. We examined the one-year hospitalization burden in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and compared hospitalization rates and patterns with those undergoing isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR).
METHODS: Using Danish nationwide registries, we identified patients who underwent first-time TAVR and isolated SAVR (2008-2019), respectively. Subsequent hospitalizations were classified as cardiovascular or noncardiovascular according to discharge diagnosis codes.
RESULTS: Patients undergoing TAVR (N = 4,921) were older and had more comorbidities than those undergoing SAVR (N = 5,220). There were 5,725 and 4,426 hospitalizations within the first year after discharge in the TAVR and SAVR group, respectively. During the one-year follow-up period post-TAVR, 46.6% were not admitted, 25.4% were admitted once, 12.6% twice, and 15.4% 3 times or more. The corresponding proportions in patients undergoing SAVR were 55.3%, 25.1%, 10.0%, and 9.5%, respectively. Among patients with ≥1 hospitalization following TAVR, 50.3% had a total length of all hospital stays between 1 and 7days, 19.0% 8-14days, 18.0% 15-30days, 9.9% 31-60days, and 2.8% ≥61days. The corresponding proportions for patients undergoing SAVR were 58.6%, 17.2%, 13.1%, 7.4%, and 3.7%, respectively. Compared with patients undergoing SAVR, those undergoing TAVR had a lower early (day0-30: HR 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80-0.98]), but a higher late hospitalization rate (day 31-365: 1.46 [1.32-1.60]).
CONCLUSIONS: The 1-year hospitalization burden following TAVR is substantial. Compared with patients undergoing isolated SAVR, those undergoing TAVR had a lower early, but a higher late hospitalization rate - a difference that likely reflects unmeasured differences in the patient cohorts.
