Title: Causal association between basal metabolic rate and risk of cardiovascular diseases: a univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization study.

Abstract: Basal metabolic rate (BMR) is associated with cardiovascular health; however, the causal relationship between BMR and the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential causal relationship of BMR on common CVDs including aortic aneurysm (AA), atrial fibrillation and flutter (AFF), calcific aortic valvular stenosis (CAVS), heart failure (HF), and myocardial infarction (MI) by Mendelian randomization (MR). The univariable MR analysis using inverse variance weighted (IVW) model as the primary analysis method revealed that genetically predicted higher BMR causally increased the risk of AA [IVW odds ratio (OR) = 1.34, 95% confidence interval CI  1.09-1.65, p = 0.00527], AFF (IVW OR = 1.87, 95% CI  1.65-2.12, p = 1.697 × E-22), and HF (IVW OR = 1.35, 95% CI  1.20-1.51, p = 2.364 × E-07), while causally decreasing the risk of MI (IVW OR = 0.83, 95% CI  0.73-0.93, p = 0.00255). In the multivariable MR analysis, which controlled for common cardiovascular risk factors, direct effects of BMR on an increased risk of AA and AFF, as well as a decreased risk of MI, but an attenuated causal effect on HF, were observed. In conclusion, the current MR study provides evidence for a causal relationship between BMR and the risk of AA, AFF, HF, and MI.
