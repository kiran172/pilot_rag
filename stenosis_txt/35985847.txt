Title: Computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) has no additional clinical impact over the anatomical Coronary Artery Disease - Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) in real-world elective healthcare of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: AIM: To evaluate the impact of computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) compared to the anatomical Coronary Artery Disease - Reporting and Data System (CAD-RADS) in the elective assessment of coronary artery disease in real-world cardiology practise.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review was undertaken of 1,239 coronary CT examinations from August 2018 to December 2019 with a minimum follow-up period of 1 year. Coronary disease was classified according to the CAD-RADS system. A non-occlusive ≥30% maximum diameter stenosis was considered eligible for FFR<sub>CT</sub>. Lesion-specific FFR<sub>CT</sub> and FFR were considered positive if ≤ 0.80. The patients were followed up using the hospital radiology information system and the electronic patient record. A positive outcome was defined by a subsequent invasive angiogram (ICA) showing disease requiring revascularisation or FFR ≤0.80 or a positive stress test or medical therapy for angina in CAD-RADS 4.
RESULTS: Of the 1,145 analysable studies (mean follow up 618 ± 153 days) the incidence of a positive result was 7% with a 5.4% elective revascularisation rate. Two hundred and forty-five patients (CAD-RADS 2-4) had FFR<sub>CT</sub>. FFR<sub>CT</sub> reduced the accuracy of the CAD-RADS grade from 91% to 78.4% (p&lt;0.001). In CAD-RADS 2, the accuracy is reduced from 99% to 90.7% (p=0.005), and in CAD-RADS 3 from 93.9% to 67.7% (p&lt;0.001). In CAD-RADS 4, FFR<sub>CT</sub> increases accuracy from 69.4% to 75.5% (p=0.025), but 89.8% of FFR<sub>CT</sub> are positive and specificity is low (26.7%).
CONCLUSION: In the present "real-world" practise, FFR<sub>CT</sub> does not improve standard radiological assessment of coronary disease graded by the CAD-RADS alone.
