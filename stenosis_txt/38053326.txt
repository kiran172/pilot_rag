Title: Unusual Presentation of Lumbar Surgical Site Infection: A Case Study of Early Onset Pasteurella multocida Infection after Arthrodesis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND Infection is a serious surgical complication that significantly increases morbidity rates and health care expenses. Most human Pasteurella multocida infections are soft-tissue infections caused by dog or cat bites. Pasteurella multocida (P. multocida) is present in the oral, nasopharyngeal, and upper respiratory tract microbiota among cats, dogs, and other domestic or wild animals. Here, we report a case of lumbar surgical site infection caused by this bacterium. CASE REPORT A 70-year-old diabetic and overweight woman had a Pasteurella multocida surgical site infection after lumbar arthrodesis carried out for lumbar stenosis associated with spondylolisthesis. The patient had been in contact with her cat and claimed to have simply slept with it in her bed. Multiple antibiotic therapies and 3 debridement-irrigations with change of spinal implants during the last revision were needed. CONCLUSIONS Infections caused by P. multocida are rare and most often occur as a result of animal scratches or bites, but can sometimes occur after simple contact with an animal. Surgical site infection of spinal arthrodesis due to Pasteurella multocida implies treatment difficulties. In case of Pasteurella multocida infection of lumbar spinal arthrodesis, even in the early period, implant removal seems to be useful to limit the appearance of biofilm more specific to this micro-organism.
