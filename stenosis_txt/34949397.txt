Title: Delayed Total Atrioventricular Block After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Assessed by Implantable Loop Recorders.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate the rate and time course of delayed total atrioventricular block (DT-AVB) after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using continuous electrocardiographic monitoring by implantable loop recorders and to identify potential predictors.
BACKGROUND: DT-AVB has been defined as onset more than 2 days after TAVR or after hospital discharge and is reported in 10% to 15% of patients at 30-day follow-up. To date, there is no standardized diagnostic and therapeutic algorithm to manage TAVR patients at risk for DT-AVB.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR and simultaneous electrophysiologic testing without persistent or recurrent total atrioventricular block within 48 hours after the procedure underwent loop recorder implantation for full disclosure of atrioventricular conduction during 12-month follow-up.
RESULTS: DT-AVB occurred in 7 of 59 patients (11.9%), with onset between 2 days and 3 months after the procedure. Both prolongation of the PQ interval between baseline and day 2 after TAVR (OR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.01-1.09); P = 0.032) and prolongation of the HV interval during the procedure (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.02-1.14; P = 0.015) significantly predicted the onset of DT-AVB.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR was associated with a considerable rate of DT-AVB of nearly 12% in this series. Prolongation of the PQ interval between baseline and day 2 and intraprocedural prolongation of the HV interval were significant predictors of DT-AVB.
