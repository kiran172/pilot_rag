Title: Impact of SPY Fluorescence Angiography on Incidence of Ureteroenteric Stricture After Urinary Diversion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Ureteroenteric strictures (UESs) are a common and morbid complication of radical cystectomy and urinary diversions. UES occurs in 4% to 25% of all patients undergoing urinary diversion, and anastomotic ischemia is implicated in stricture formation. SPY fluorescence angiography is a technology that can be employed during open surgery that allows for evaluation of ureteral perfusion.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective single-institution study of intraoperative use of SPY for ureteral assessment with a primary outcome of UES incidence compared with a cohort of historic controls prior to the use of SPY during urinary diversion at our institution. Chart abstraction was conducted to determine the presence of confirmed stricture in these patients, defined as endoscopic diagnosis or definitive imaging findings. Statistical analysis was performed using χ2 test for UES incidence. Demographic characteristics were analyzed with Wilcoxon rank sum test and χ2 test.
RESULTS: A total of 332 patients underwent urinary diversion during the study period. UES occurred in 31 of 277 patients (11.1%) in the control group compared with 1 of 55 patients (1.8%) enrolled in the SPY arm (P = .03). The per-ureter UES rate was 6.7% (33/582) in the control group compared with 0.9% (1/107) in the SPY group. Median follow-up in the SPY group was 17.5 months and 58.6 months in the control group. Median Charlson Comorbidity Index was 5 in the SPY group and 4 in the control group. There were no other significant demographic differences between the study groups.
CONCLUSIONS: SPY fluorescent angiography can be used during open urinary diversion to ensure perfusion to ureteroenteric anastomosis. Our single-institution study demonstrates a decreased incidence of UES when ureteral perfusion assessment is performed.
