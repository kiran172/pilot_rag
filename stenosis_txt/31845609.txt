Title: Hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis presenting with acute bilateral ptosis: case report.

Abstract: Hydrocephalus may cause Parinaud's syndrome which consists of vertical gaze palsy, convergence palsy, lid retraction and pupil light-near dissociation. We are aware of only two prior reports of hydrocephalus presenting with bilateral ptosis. Both were cured by ventriculoperitoneal shunts. We report a 28-month-old girl who presented acute bilateral ptosis but full eye movements both sides. Neuroimages revealed chronic hydrocephalus and aqueductal stenosis. The bilateral ptosis resolved quickly after endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV).
