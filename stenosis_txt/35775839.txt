Title: [Minimally invasive esophagectomy for benign esophageal diseases: results of a two-center study].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the results of thoracoscopic esophagectomy for benign esophageal diseases.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 78 patients who underwent thoracoscopic esophagectomy between 2011 and 2019. Peptic and burn strictures of the esophagus were diagnosed in 53 patients, achalasia - in 24 patients. Minimally invasive esophagectomy and esophagoplasty with isoperistaltic gastric tube and esophagogastrostomy on the neck was performed in 68 patients, Ivor Lewis esophagectomy - in 1 patient, coloesophagoplasty - in 9 patients. We used manual technique of anastomosis in 58 patients, stapling device - in 19 patients. In 1 case, surgery was finished with esophagostomy and gastrostomy.
RESULTS: Mean blood loss was 200 ml (10-1200), surgery time - 450 min (265-765 min). Early postoperative complications occurred in 37 patients including anastomotic leakage in 24 cases. In long-term period, anastomotic strictures developed in 9 patients. No mortality was observed.
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive esophagectomy for benign esophageal diseases ensures favorable clinical outcomes. However, no consensus in the choice of surgical approach and indications, as well as small number of these patients cause challenges in implementation of this technique. There are different opinions regarding technique of anastomosis on the neck and surgical access in thoracoscopic esophagectomy.
