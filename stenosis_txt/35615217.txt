Title: Femoral Vein Occlusion or Stenosis Using a Suture-Mediated Vascular Closure Device After Catheter Ablation.

Abstract: A suture-mediated vascular closure device is useful for hemostasis of the femoral vein after catheter ablation; however, venous complications remain unclear. We encountered 2 cases of femoral vein occlusion and stenosis using a suture-mediated vascular closure device. Both patients underwent surgical repair and recovered venous flow. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
