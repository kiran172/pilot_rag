Title: Periprocedural Changes of Serum Biomarkers in Predicting Complications Following Bariatric Surgery for Obesity: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: Bariatric surgery is an effective treatment for severe obesity, but complications and peri-operative monitoring are important considerations. We conducted a comprehensive review of studies assessing pre-operative biomarkers and complications in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. A total of 14 studies were included. Gastric leak, infections, bleeding, obstruction or stenosis, hypoglycemia, and hypoalbuminemia were the most common complications observed. Our analysis showed a significant association between lower pre-operative albumin levels and complications (SMD [95%CI] =  - 0.21 [- 0.38; - 0.04]). However, other biomarkers did not have a significant impact on complication occurrence. Changes in C-reactive protein, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, and white blood cell levels were observed in certain peri-operative time points and complication subgroups. These findings suggest the potential use of pre-operative biomarkers and peri-operative changes of biomarker's levels for predicting complications.
