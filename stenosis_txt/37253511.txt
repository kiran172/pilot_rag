Title: [Consensus recommendations on the evaluation and treatment of laryngotracheal anomalies in infants and young children].

Abstract: Infants with laryngotracheal anomalies are clinically manifested as stridor or noisy breathing, choking, hoarseness, feeding difficulties, and cyanotic spells, followed by developmental and growth retardation and other health issues; in severe cases, patients may present with severe dyspnea, which is associated with high mortality. A timely diagnosis as well as appropriate strategy for laryngotracheal anomalies is still challenging for pediatric otolaryngologists. This consensus statement, evolved from expert opinion by the members of the Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology Professional Committee of the Pediatrician Branch of the Chinese Medical Doctor Association, provides comprehensive recommendations and standardized guidance for otolaryngologists who manage infants and young children with laryngotracheal anomalies in evaluation and treatment based on symptomatology, physical and laboratory examinations.
