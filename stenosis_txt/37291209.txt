Title: Mid-term outcomes and hemodynamic performance of the St Jude Medical Epic aortic bioprosthesis for severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: The St. Jude Medical Epic Supra valve is a porcine bioprosthesis designed for complete supraannular implantation. No report has shown the hemodynamic performance and clinical outcomes of aortic valve replacement with the Epic Supra valve for severe aortic stenosis in a Japanese cohort. We retrospectively evaluated 65 patients who underwent aortic valve replacement using the Epic Supra valve for aortic stenosis at our department between May, 2011 and October, 2016. The mean follow-up period was 68.7 ± 32.7 months, and the follow-up rate was 89.2%. The mean age was 76.8 ± 5.3 years. The 1-, 5-, and 8-year survival rates were 96.9%, 79.4%, and 60.3%, respectively. The rates of freedom from valve-related events were 96.6% and 81.9% at 5 and 8 years, respectively. Four patients were diagnosed with structural valve deterioration (SVD), and reintervention was performed in two patients. The rates of freedom from SVD were 98.2% and 83.3% at 5 and 8 years, respectively, and the mean time to diagnosis of SVD was 72.5 ± 25.3 months. The mean pressure gradient (MPG) was 16.8 ± 6.0 mmHg postoperatively, 17.5 ± 9.4 mmHg at 5 years, and 21.2 ± 12.4 mmHg at 8 years (p = 0.08). The effective orifice area index (EOAI) was 0.95 ± 0.2 cm2/m2 immediately after surgery, 0.96 ± 0.27 cm2/m2 at 5 years, and 0.84 ± 0.2 cm2/m2 at 8 years (p = 0.10). An increase in MPG and decrease in EOAI were also observed, which may be associated with SVD. Follow-up after 5 years is important to determine if there is an increase.
