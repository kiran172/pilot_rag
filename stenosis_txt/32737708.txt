Title: Comprehensive assessment of coronary computed tomography angiography by using Leaman and Leiden score in overweight and obese patients.

Abstract: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is a non-invasive modality used to assess for coronary artery disease. The CT Leaman and Leiden scores utilize coronary plaque location, composition and severity of stenosis to risk stratify patients for cardiovascular events with remarkable precision. This study compares the CCTA Leaman and Leiden score between overweight and obese populations in addition to their associated baseline characteristics. All patients who underwent CCTA within the last 1 year from a single institution were included for initial analysis. Body mass index (BMI) was used to classify patients who were overweight (25.0 to &lt; 30 kg/m2) or obese (≥ 30 kg/m2). Patients with a BMI of &lt; 25 kg/m2 were excluded from further analysis. Patients were divided into overweight and obese groups. CT Leaman and Leiden scores, in addition to baseline characteristics were subsequently compared between the two groups. Overall, a strong correlation between CT Leaman and Leiden scores was found (R2 = 0.9831). Patients classified as obese have more coronary lesions 0.71 ± 0.12 vs 0.31 ± 0.50 in overweight patients (p = 0.02) and tended to have a higher positive CT Leiden (5.47 ± 4.10 vs 3.90 ± 1.36, p = 0.2) and Leaman (3.45 ± 2.58 vs 2.35 ± 0.90, p = 0.1). Furthermore, obese patients with a Leiden score &gt; 5 had significantly higher scores compared to overweight patients (10.22 ± 2.54 vs 5.87 ± 0.64, p = 0.016). Obese patients had similar average CT Leaman and Leiden scores compared to overweight individuals but were more likely to have higher CT Leiden scores &gt; 5 which may indicate a higher risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.
