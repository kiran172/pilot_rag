Title: Renal Autotransplantation in a Patient with Bilateral Renal Artery Stenosis Secondary to Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Involvement of the renal artery is common in Takayasu arteritis. We, herein, present on a patient with Takayasu arteritis causing severe renal failure and a successful auto-transplantation. This case shows that early diagnosis and immediate appropriate interventions are life-saving in patients with Takayasu arteritis. Renal auto-transplantation performed in selected cases increases dialysis-free survival.
