Title: Subclavian steal syndrome: a case study of diagnosis, management, and successful surgical resolution.

Abstract: Subclavian steal syndrome (SSS) is a rare vascular condition characterized by retrograde blood flow in the vertebral artery, often discovered incidentally in asymptomatic patients. We present a 65-year-old male with recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) attributed to 99% stenosis at the origin of the left subclavian artery, leading to SSS. Diagnostic modalities included duplex ultrasound, confirming inverted left vertebral artery flow, and multi-slice computed tomography angiography, confirming the diagnosis. Despite an unsuccessful attempt at balloon angioplasty, successful vascular surgery was performed, establishing a left carotid-vertebral artery bypass. The patient recovered well without complications. This case underscores the importance of considering SSS in TIA cases, utilizing non-invasive diagnostic tools, and highlighting the successful management of symptomatic SSS through surgical intervention.
