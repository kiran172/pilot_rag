Title: Slide Tracheoplasty for Repair of Complex Tracheoesophageal Fistulas.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Repair of large, recurrent, and complex tracheoesophageal fistulas (TEFs) is challenging and numerous different surgical approaches exist. These various techniques each carry a set of risks and possible complications such as fistula recurrence, tracheal stenosis or pouches, esophageal stenosis, and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury. Slide tracheoplasty is a reconstructive technique successfully used in many different airway pathologies, including TEF repair. This study examines the success, limits, and complications related to slide tracheoplasty for repair of complex TEFs.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
METHODS: Patients undergoing TEF repair using a cervical or thoracic approach slide tracheoplasty, at a single institution, between July 2008 and December 2019 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographic data, comorbidities, TEF etiology and surgical history, slide tracheoplasty details and outcomes, and postoperative complication data were examined using descriptive statistics.
RESULTS: Twenty-six patients underwent 27 slide tracheoplasties for TEF (20 cervical approaches, 7 thoracic approaches) with a mean age of 5.2 years (IQR 0.7-7.6) at time of surgery. The most common TEF etiologies included congenital (n = 13), tracheostomy tube erosion (n = 5), and button battery ingestion (n = 4). Fistulas ranged in size from <0.5 mm to 4 cm and 59% had previous endoscopic or open repairs. There were two TEF recurrences (7.4%), one of which was successfully revised and the other which was treated with stent placement. Postoperative complications included dehiscence (3.7%), unilateral vocal fold paralysis (3.7%), and mild tracheal stenosis (18.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Slide tracheoplasty is an effective surgical technique for treating complex congenital and acquired TEFs with lower rates of complications when compared to other techniques.
