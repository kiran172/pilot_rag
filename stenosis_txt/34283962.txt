Title: A New Technique of Aortoventricular Patch Enlargement and Root Replacement for Annular Hypoplasia.

Abstract: The Ross-Konno operation is effective for enlargement of a hypoplastic aortic annulus and left ventricular outflow tract. It is, however, an invasive operation with the potential for early and late cardiac morbidity. We propose a new technique of annular and outflow tract enlargement that avoids the septal incision while effectively opening up the outflow tract and aortic annulus.
