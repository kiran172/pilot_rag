Title: PATIENT-RELATED FACTORS AFFECTING THE RISK OF COMPLICATIONS AFTER PRIMARY TOTAL HIP ARTHROPLASTY.

Abstract: Total hip arthroplasty is considered an effective surgery to restore limb function, reduce pain, and improve patient quality of life. The number of primary THAs is increasing every year, but despite the success rates, revision surgery remains a serious complication. The purpose of this review is to summarize current scientific evidence and evaluate patient-related risk factors and their impact on the clinical and functional outcomes of primary THA and revision. Among the demographic factors that have a strong influence on the outcome of THA are age and body mass index. It has been shown that young people have a high risk of aseptic loosening and dislocation, and the risk of complications such as thromboembolism and infection is higher in the elderly and senile. The risk of revision and complications after primary THA is significantly increased in people with high body weight and obesity. A strong risk factor causing complications is smoking and alcohol abuse. The review analyzed the influence of various diseases present in patients as risk factors for various postoperative complications: osteoporosis, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, avascular necrosis, neurological diseases. An increased risk factor for dislocation and an important reason for surgical revision after primary THA is a history of orthopedic disease and spinal surgery (lumbar stenosis, scoliosis, spondylosis, discectomy, and trauma). Understanding patient-related factors is important for clinical decision making in primary THA and revision and contributes to understanding which patients will be at the highest risk of complications after surgery.
