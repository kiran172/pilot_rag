Title: TAVR explant with aortic root replacement using a homograft for an aortic rupture.

Abstract: This case report describes the explantation of an Evolut PRO valve 9 months after implantation in a 69-year-old male presenting with an aortic rupture adjacent to the stent frame of the prosthesis. Imaging was consistent with aortic sinus pseudoaneurysm and a large haemopericardium. Degeneration of the aortic root compounded by the transcatheter prosthesis in addition to the aortic rupture required replacement of the aortic root. The complexity of the procedure also required a modified Cabrol extension of the left coronary button and reconstruction of the left coronary button with bovine pericardium. We describe the technical challenges posed by the self-expanding transcatheter aortic valve prosthesis and tips and tricks to circumvent these challenges.
