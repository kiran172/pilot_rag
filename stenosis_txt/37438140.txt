Title: Encapsulating Peritoneal Sclerosis in a Patient Receiving Peritoneal Dialysis and Glucocorticoid Therapy.

Abstract: Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a fatal complication of peritoneal dialysis. A 68-year-old man undergoing peritoneal dialysis for 10 years started receiving daily 50 mg of glucocorticoids for idiopathic pulmonary sclerosis. At the transition to hemodialysis, a peritoneal biopsy was performed, which demonstrated mild histological changes, including no fibrin formation and mild T lymphocyte infiltration at the time of 6.5 mg glucocorticoids. However, five months later, he developed EPS when receiving 2.5 mg glucocorticoids. Afterward, over 5 mg daily glucocorticoids were required to avoid the recurrence of EPS. These findings suggest that glucocorticoids may conceal peritoneal inflammation, a main contributor to EPS.
