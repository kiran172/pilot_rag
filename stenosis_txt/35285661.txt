Title: Hemobilia due to porto-biliary fistula complicating endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography after a recent liver transplantation.

Abstract: A 60-year-old woman with autoimmune hepatitis submitted to liver transplantation presented with a biliary anastomotic stenosis. An endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was complicated with a porto-biliary fistula due to the misplacement of a biliary stent. After multidisciplinary discussion, and the stent was endoscopically removed while a percutaneous transhepatic fully-covered self-expanded metal stent was placed in portal vein. Iatrogenic porto-biliary fistula following biliary stent placement is a rare and potentially life-threatening ERCP complication. In a suspected stent-related portal vein injury, this multidisciplinary strategy combining gastroenterology and radiology proved to be an effective and safe minimally invasive technique avoiding catastrophic consequences.
