Title: Predictors of discordance between fractional flow reserve and resting full-cycle ratio in patients with coronary artery disease: Evidence from clinical practice.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an established method for assessing functional myocardial ischemia. Recently, the resting full-cycle ratio (RFR) has been introduced as a non-hyperemic index of functional coronary stenosis. However, the effects of clinical characteristics on discordance between RFR and FFR have not been fully evaluated. We aimed to identify clinical characteristics that influence FFR-RFR concordance.
METHODS: We included 410 patients with 573 intermediate coronary lesions who underwent clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography, as well as assessments of FFR and RFR. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves were created to assess the optimal cut-off values of RFR for predicting FFR ≤0.80.
RESULTS: RFR exhibited a strong correlation with FFR (r = 0.66, p < 0.0001). ROC analysis identified an optimal RFR cut-off value of 0.92 for categorization based on an FFR cut-off value of 0.8. The discordance of FFR >0.8 and RFR ≤0.92 (high FFR/low RFR) was observed in 112 lesions (20.9%), whereas the discordance of FFR ≤0.8 and RFR >0.92 (low FFR/high RFR) was observed in 35 lesions (6.5%). Higher rate of hemodialysis and lower hemoglobin levels were observed in the high FFR/low RFR group. Multivariate analyses identified female sex, left anterior descending artery (LAD) lesions, and hemodialysis as significant predictors of high FFR/low RFR. Conversely, body surface area and non-LAD lesions were significantly associated with low FFR/high RFR. Hemodialysis [odds ratio (OR): 2.41, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-4.41; p = 0.005] and LAD lesions (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 1.25-2.79; p = 0.002) were identified as independent predictors of overall FFR-RFR discordance.
CONCLUSIONS: RFR exhibited good diagnostic performance in the identification of functionally significant stenosis. However, RFR may overestimate functional severity in patients undergoing hemodialysis or in those with LAD lesions. Further prospective trials are required to demonstrate the non-inferiority of RFR to FFR.
