Title: Triglyceride-glucose index and coronary artery disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of risk, severity, and prognosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The TyG index is an indicator of insulin resistance (IR), which is associated with the development and prognosis of cardiovascular disease. This study aimed to summarize the relationship between the TyG index and the risk, severity, and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.
METHODS: The PubMed, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases were searched for articles published from inception until May 1, 2023. Cross-sectional studies, retrospective or prospective cohort studies recruiting patients with CAD were included. For the analysis of CAD severity, the outcomes were coronary artery calcification, coronary artery stenosis, coronary plaque progression, multi-vessel CAD, and in-stent re-stenosis. For the analysis of CAD prognosis, the primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
RESULTS: Forty-one studies were included in this study. Compared to patients with the lowest TyG index, those with the highest TyG index had a higher CAD risk [odds ratio (OR): 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-3.14, I2 = 91%, P = 0.007]. Additionally, these patients were more likely to have stenotic coronary arteries (OR: 3.49, 95% CI 1.71-7.12, I2 = 0%, P = 0.0006), progressed plaques (OR: 1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.19, I2 = 0%, P = 0.002), and with more vessels involved (OR: 2.33, 95% CI 1.59-3.42, I2 = 0%, P &lt; 0.0001). When calculated as a categorized variable, it appears that acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with higher TyG index levels may have a higher incidence rate of MACE [hazard ratio (HR): 2.09, 95% CI 1.68-2.62, I2 = 87%, P &lt; 0.00001], whereas chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) or stable CAD patients with higher TyG index levels showed a trend towards an increased incidence rate of MACE (HR: 1.24, 95% CI 0.96-1.60, I2 = 85%, P = 0.09). When calculated as a continuous variable, ACS patients had an HR of 2.28 per 1-unit/1-standard deviation increment of the TyG index (95% CI 1.44-3.63, I2 = 95%, P = 0.0005). Similarly, CCS or stable CAD patients had an HR of 1.49 per 1-unit/1-standard deviation increment of the TyG index (95% CI 1.21-1.83, I2 = 75%, P = 0.0001). Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries patients had an HR of 1.85 per 1-unit increment of the TyG index (95% CI 1.17-2.93, P = 0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: The TyG index is a simple new synthetic index that has been proven to be a valuable tool in the whole-course management of CAD patients. Patients with higher TyG index levels are at a higher risk of CAD, more severe coronary artery lesions, and worse prognosis compared to those with lower TyG index levels.
