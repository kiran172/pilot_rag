Title: [Surgical treatment strategy of pulmonary artery sling: a series of 110 cases].

Abstract: Objective: To examine the effect of surgical treatment in children with pulmonary artery sling and the surgical treatment strategy. Methods: Relevant data of 110 children with pulmonary artery sling admitted to the Department of Cardiac Surgery, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University from February 2017 to July 2022 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 55 males and 55 females, aging (M(IQR)) 9.0 (10.6) months (range: 1 to 96 months). The weight was 7.8 (3.5) kg (range: 2.5 to 25.0 kg). Of the 110 patients, 108 had different degrees of tracheal stenosis and 2 had normal trachea. Left pulmonary artery transplantation and tracheoplasty were performed in 78 patients. Left pulmonary artery transplantation was performed in 30 patients (11 in our hospital and 19 in other hospitals) due to the lack of an early tracheoplasty technique, in which 24 patients needed stage Ⅱ tracheoplasty due to obvious respiratory symptoms and limited activity endurance, and 6 cases did not intervene. Two children with normal trachea only underwent left pulmonary artery transplantation. Results: Among the 78 children who underwent surgery in the same period, 70 cases recovered smoothly after surgery, of whom respiratory symptoms were significantly reduced or disappeared during the 1 to 65 months follow-up, with similar activity endurance to normal children of the same age. Eight cases died, including 4 cases of postoperative multi-drug resistant bacteria infection, died from tracheal anastomotic opening or septic shock, 1 cases with severe congenital heart disease died from postoperative low cardiac output syndrome difficult to correct, 1 case died from blood pressure could not be maintained due to the compressed left pulmonary artery after transplantation, 2 cases of postoperative digestive system diseases (adhesive intestinal obstruction, gastrointestinal bleeding, etc.). The 24 patients in the staging group were followed for 1 to 84 months. All patients needed stage Ⅱ tracheoplasty due to respiratory symptoms and decreased endurance to activity. Eight cases of the non-intervention tracheal group were successfully separated from the ventilator, cured and discharged in a short period of time. Conclusions: Most children with pulmonary artery sling have tracheal stenosis. Children with low degree of tracheal stenosis and inconspicuous respiratory symptoms can only undergo left pulmonary artery transplantation by lateral thoracotomy. For patients combined with severe tracheal stenosis or obvious respiratory symptoms, a simultaneous left pulmonary artery transplantat and tracheoplasty is recommended.
