Title: Left and right coronary artery blood flow distribution method based on dominant type.

Abstract: The purpose of the current study was to investigate the effects of left/right coronary artery flow distribution on calculation of fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (FFRct) in different dominant types. First, 195 patients were collected to count the distribution ratios of the three categories: right dominance (RD), balanced dominance (BD), and left dominance (LD). Ratios of diameters of the left/right coronary arteries (D<sub>LCA</sub> :D<sub>RCA</sub> ) of the three types were calculated and used to represent the ratio of flow distribution (Q<sub>LCA</sub> :Q<sub>RCA</sub> ) in the dominant type method. The other method was known as the fixed ratio method (Q<sub>LCA</sub> :Q<sub>RCA</sub>  = 6:4). Second, a total of 73 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) were enrolled for numerical calculation. A 0D/3D geometric multiscale model was used for the numerical simulation of FFR and the results of the fixed ratio method and the dominant type method were recorded as F-FFRct and D-FFRct. Lastly, invasive FFR(clinic-FFR)was used as a standard to evaluate the consistency and diagnostic performance of F-FFRct and D-FFRct. Corresponding flow distributions for the dominant type method were Q<sub>LCA</sub> :Q<sub>RCA</sub>  = 5:5 for RD, Q<sub>LCA</sub> :Q<sub>RCA</sub>  = 5.5:4.5 for BD, and Q<sub>LCA</sub> :Q<sub>RCA</sub>  = 6:4 for LD. D-FFRct showed a better correlation than F-FFRct (r = 0.85 vs. r = 0.81, both p &lt; .001); the AUC (95%CI) were 0.974 (0.906-0.997, p &lt; .0001) and 0.960 (0.886-0.992, p &lt; .0001). Accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) for D-FFRct and F-FFRct were 94.52%, 93.75%, 94.74%, 83.33%, 98.18% and 90.41%, 87.50%, 91.23%, 73.68%, 96.30%, respectively. Overall, the left/right coronary artery flow distribution was affected by the dominant type and the dominant type method was superior to the fixed ratio method in detecting coronary ischemic lesions.
