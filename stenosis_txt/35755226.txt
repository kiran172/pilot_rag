Title: Charles Bonnet Syndrome in a Patient With Acute Glaucoma Following Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: Acute neovascular glaucoma is an extremely rare complication following carotid artery revascularization that can lead to permanent vision loss. We describe an unusual case of acute glaucoma following carotid endarterectomy presenting with mechanical pupillary dilation and vivid visual hallucinations consistent with the Charles Bonnet Syndrome. This case highlights the importance of screening patients complaining of vision loss or eye pain for neovascular eye changes prior to carotid revascularization. These patients' eye health should be closely monitored peri-operatively.
