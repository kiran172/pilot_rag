Title: Robotic-Assisted Endovascular Treatment for Transplant Renal Artery Stenosis: A Feasibility Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To describe a single-center experience with robotic-assisted endovascular treatment for transplant renal artery stenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective, feasibility study of 4 consecutive cases of robotic-assisted endovascular surgery for transplant renal artery stenosis from October 2021 to August 2022.
RESULTS: All lesions were identified, and stenting was performed with no complications. Conversion to manual control was not necessary. The mean fluoroscopy time was 25.25Â min (range 12-60.9). A control Doppler ultrasound was routinely performed, demonstrating no residual lesions in all cases. There was no reintervention during the follow-up period. The operator learning curve was felt to be acceptable.
CONCLUSION: Robotic-assisted endovascular treatment is a feasible technique for transplant renal artery stenosis.
