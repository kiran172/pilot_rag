Title: Quantitative and Qualitative Characteristics of Atherosclerotic Plaques on Carotid Arteries in Patients with Antiphospholipid Syndrome: The Role of MDCT Angiography.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disease characterised by arterious and venous thrombosis, miscarriage, and the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the blood. As we know, APS is also characterised by accelerated atherosclerotic degeneration with an increased risk of thrombosis in all blood vessels, including the carotid arteries. Carotid artery stenosis can manifest in many different ways. The aim of this study is to present the results of our multidetector computerised tomography angiography (MDCTA) analysis of the carotid arteries in patients with primary and secondary APS compared with a control group.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study examined 50 patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) and 50 patients with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (SAPS). The results were compared with a control group also comprising 50 patients. The groups were analysed with respect to age, sex and the presence of well-established risk factors for vascular disease. The study was conducted using MDCTA, where we analysed the quantitative and qualitative (morphologic) characteristics of carotid artery lesions.
RESULTS: Patients from the control group had significantly elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in comparison with patients with PAPS and SAPS (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05). The results show that carotid artery lesions were significantly more common in patients with APS (PAPS, n = 40, CI95: 0.50-0.75, p = 0.0322 and SAFS, n = 54, CI95: 0.59-0.80, p = 0.0004) than within the control group (n = 23). There was a statistically significant difference between patients with APS and the control group with respect to lesions in the distal segments (n = 27, CI95: 0.67-0.95, p = 0.0001), bulbi and proximal segments (n = 21, CI95: 0.84-1.00, p = 0.000005). The number of patients with one lesion (L) (n = 27) was significantly greater than the number of those with three (n = 10, CI95: 0.56-0.86, p = 0.0051) or four (n = 3, CI95: 0.73-0.98, p = 0.00001) lesions. There were also more patients with two lesions (n = 24) than those with four (n = 3) (CI95: 0.71-0.97, p = 0.00005). Carotid artery stenosis was shown as a percentage of the carotid artery lumen diameter (%DS). Stenosis of up to 30%, was more common in patients in the PAPS group (n = 12) than in the control group (n = 3) (CI95: 0.52-0.96, p = 0.0201), while the SAPS group (n = 17) had an even larger disparity (CI95: 0.62-0.97, p = 0.0017). We observed a highly significant difference in the frequency of stenoses between 30% and 50% DS between the PAPS group (n = 24) and the control group (n = 7) (CI95: 0.59-0.90, p = 0.0023), as well as the SAPS group (n = 30) (CI95: 0.65-0.92, p = 0.0002). A qualitative analysis of plaque morphology revealed that patients with PAPS had significantly more soft tissue lesions (n = 23) compared with calcified lesions (n = 2) (CI95: 0.74-0.99, p = 0.00003), as well as more mixed plaques (n = 9) and calcified plaques (n = 2) (CI95: 0.48-0.98, p = 0.0348). Patients within the SAPS group had significantly more soft tissue (n = 35) than calcified lesions (n = 3) (CI95: 0.79-0.98, p = 0.00000021), as well as more mixed lesions (n = 21) compared with calcified (n = 3) (CI95: 0.68-0.97, p = 0.0002).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that subclinical manifestations of carotid artery lesions were more common in patients with APS. We came to the conclusion that MDCTA is an accurate diagnostic method because it is a safe method that provides us with a great quantity of accurate information about the characteristics of atheromatous plaques, which aids us in the further planning of treatment for patients with APS.
