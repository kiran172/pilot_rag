Title: 3D patient-specific modeling and structural finite element analysis of atherosclerotic carotid artery based on computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: The assessment of carotid plaque vulnerability is a relevant clinical information that can help prevent adverse cerebrovascular events. To this aim, in this study, we propose a patient-specific computational workflow to quantify the stress distribution in an atherosclerotic carotid artery, by means of geometric modeling and structural simulation of the plaque and vessel wall. Ten patients were involved in our study. Starting with segmentation of the lumen, calcific and lipid plaque components from computed tomography angiography images, the fibrous component and the vessel wall were semi-automatically reconstructed with an ad-hoc procedure. Finite element analyses were performed using local pressure values derived from ultrasound imaging. Simulation outputs were analyzed to assess how mechanical factors influence the stresses within the atherosclerotic wall. The developed reconstruction method was first evaluated by comparing the results obtained using the automatically generated fibrous component model and the one derived from image segmentation. The high-stress regions in the carotid artery wall around plaques suggest areas of possible rupture. In mostly lipidic and heterogeneous plaques, the highest stresses are localized at the interface between the lipidic components and the lumen, in the fibrous cap.
