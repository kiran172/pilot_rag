Title: [Gastric pull-up in caustic stenosis: presentation of a complex clinical case].

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chemical substances are important causes of gastrointestinal tract injuries and usually affect two groups of patients: children under 5 years of age and adults who attempt suicide. Its effects can range from necrosis to perforation of the digestive tract, which can affect the mouth, pharynx, esophagus and stomach. The main complication of accidental caustic ingestion is esophageal stricture. The frequency with which esophageal strictures appear ranges from 15% to 35% and is related to the degree of injury induced by the ingested agent. They may become symptomatic by the second or third week after a latent repair phase or, in other cases, months or years after ingestion. Different forms of treatment have been applied to treat caustic esophageal strictures, and endoscopic dilation is the first line, with successful results in 60% to 80% of patients. If these are not effective, surgical treatment for esophageal replacement is indicated.
CLINICAL CASE: A clinical case of a 48-year-old male patient with no chronic degenerative history is presented, who began suffering after accidental ingestion of caustic substance 4 months ago with dysphagia to liquids and solids, for which he is protocolized in our unit for definitive surgical resolution by gastric pull-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Although associated with high rates of anastomotic stricture, transhiatal esophagectomy and gastric pull-up with cervical anastomosis are safe procedures for the treatment of caustic esophageal strictures.
