Title: Dysphagia in patients undergoing esophageal atresia surgery: Assessment using a functional scale.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Dysphagia is defined as difficulty swallowing. Up to 84% of patients undergoing esophageal atresia surgery have dysphagia beyond the neonatal period.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of patients undergoing esophageal atresia surgery from 2005 to 2021 was carried out. The Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS) was used to assess dysphagia in 4 age groups (< 1 year old, 1-4 years old, 5-11 years old, and > 11 years old). FOIS scores < 7 or symptoms of choking, impaction, or food aversion were regarded as dysphagia.
RESULTS: 63 patients were analyzed. 74% (47/63) had dysphagia during follow-up. Prevalence was 50% in patients < 1 year old (FOIS mean 4.32), 77% in patients aged 1-4 (FOIS mean 5.61), 45% in patients aged 5-11 (FOIS mean 5.87), and 38% in patients > 11 years old (FOIS mean 6.8). The most frequent causes of dysphagia were stenosis, which occurred in 38% of the patients (n=24), and gastroesophageal reflux (n=18), which was present in 28% of the patients. Both conditions were associated with significantly lower mean FOIS scores (p< 0.05) in the patients under 11 years of age. Differences (p< 0.05) were found in the dysphagia-associated perinatal factors in the various age groups, with longer ventilation assistance times, parenteral nutrition, and hospital stays.
CONCLUSIONS: Dysphagia is an extremely frequent symptom at any given age in patients undergoing esophageal atresia surgery. A standardized, cross-disciplinary follow-up is key to improve quality of life.
