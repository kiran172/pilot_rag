Title: Long-Term Outcome of Endoscopic Balloon Dilation for Duodenal Crohn's Disease-Associated Strictures.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Duodenal Crohn's disease (CD) is rare and may present with obstructive symptoms, and few reports have focused on endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) for duodenal CD-associated strictures.
AIMS: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of EBD for duodenal CD-associated strictures.
METHODS: Patients with duodenal CD-associated strictures who underwent EBD were recruited. The clinical date, stricture characteristics, number of EBDs, dilation diameter, complications, surgical interventions, and follow-up periods were recorded. Patients were also divided into a serial dilation group and a nonserial dilation group to analyze the efficacy and safety of serial EBD for duodenal strictures.
RESULTS: A total of 54 patients with duodenal CD-associated strictures underwent a total of 153 dilations. Technical success was achieved in 98.69% (151/153) of cases. The short-term efficacy at 1 month and 2 months was 100%. At a median follow-up period of 223 days (range 30-866), 11 patients underwent surgery, and the total clinical efficacy was 79.63% (43/54). No difference in the safety or efficacy was noted between the serial dilation group and the nonserial dilation group. The median surgery-free survival of 507 days (range 170-857) and the median recurrence-free survival of 215 days (range 30-866) in the serial dilation group were significantly longer than those in the nonserial dilation group (185.5 days (range 73-275) and 124 days (range 30-699), respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: EBD is a safe and effective treatment for duodenal CD-associated strictures. Serial dilations could delay recurrence and surgical intervention but did not change the long-term outcome or prevent surgery.
