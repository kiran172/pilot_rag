Title: The Treatment Dilemma of Arteriopathy in Takayasu Arteritis- A State-of-the-Art Approach.

Abstract: Takayasu Arteritis (TA) is a chronic idiopathic granulomatous pan-arteritis affecting the pulmonary artery, the aorta, and its principal derived branches. The majority of TA patients are female (82.9%-97.0%). Due to the inflammatory character of the illness, arterial stenosis therapy must be treated differently than the atherosclerosis process. In this review paper, we outline a strategy using real-world challenging cases.
