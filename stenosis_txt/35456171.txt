Title: Association of Increased Vascular Stiffness with Cardiovascular Death and Heart Failure Episodes Following Intervention on Symptomatic Degenerative Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The resistive (RI) and pulsatile (PI) indices are markers of vascular stiffness (VS) which are associated with outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease. We aimed to assess whether VS might predict incidence of cardiovascular death (CVD) and heart failure (HF) episodes following intervention on degenerative aortic valve stenosis (DAS).
METHODS: The distribution of increased VS (RI ≥ 0.7 and PI ≥ 1.3) from supra-aortic arteries was assessed in patients with symptomatic DAS who underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR, n = 127) or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI, n = 119). During a 3-year follow-up period (FU), incidences of composite endpoint (CVD and HF) were recorded.
RESULTS: Increased VS was found in 100% of TAVI patients with adverse event vs. 88.9% event-free TAVI patients (p = 0.116), and in 93.3% of AVR patients with event vs. 70.5% event-free (p = 0.061). Kaplan-Mayer free-survival curves at 1-year and 3-year FU were 90.5% vs. 97.1 % and 78% vs. 97.1% for patients with increased vs. lower VS. (p = 0.014). In univariate Cox analysis, elevated VS (HR 7.97, p = 0.04) and age (HR 1.05, p = 0.024) were associated with risk of adverse outcomes; however, both failed in Cox multivariable analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular stiffness is associated with outcome after DAS intervention. However, it cannot be used as an independent outcome predictor.
