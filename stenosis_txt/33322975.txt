Title: Safety and feasibility of carotid revascularization in patients with cerebral embolic strokes associated with carotid webs and histopathology revisited.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid web is increasingly recognized as the cause of ischemic embolic strokes in younger patients. The best way to treat carotid web is debatable and carotid artery stenting (CAS) has been reported as a treatment for the carotid web in only a few case series. In this study we evaluate the safety and feasibility of CAS in symptomatic carotid webs and examined the histopathology of a carotid web.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: At our institution between 2017 and 2019, 10 consecutive patients with symptomatic carotid webs were treated. We retrospectively analyzed the data for patient demographics, clinical presentation, imaging, treatment methodology and follow up.
RESULTS: All the patients had presented with ipsilateral embolic stroke. The mean age at presentation was 50 years (range 37-71) with seven female and three male patients. All patients underwent CAS except one patient who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA). In one stented patient, there was significant hypotension in the post-procedural period lasting a week. The patients were followed for a mean of 5.5 months (range one day-12 months). No recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurred. Surgical pathological studies confirmed fibromuscular dysplasia in one specimen.
CONCLUSION: In our experience CAS for carotid web is feasible and safe in patients presenting with ischemic embolic strokes.
