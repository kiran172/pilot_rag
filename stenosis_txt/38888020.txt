Title: [Double-tract reconstruction after gastrectomy for gastric cancer in patients with concomitant cardiovascular diseases].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the capabilities and advantages of double-tract reconstruction after gastrectomy for gastric cancer and simultaneous approach in surgical treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases and gastric cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We present two cases of double-tract reconstruction after gastrectomy and the gastric stump extirpation as a part of simultaneous surgical approach to patients with gastric cancer and cardiovascular diseases. A 62-year-old patient underwent simultaneous gastrectomy with double-tract reconstruction (for the first time In Russia) and aortofemoral replacement. A 61-year-old patient underwent simultaneous coronary artery bypass surgery, gastric stump extirpation with esophagogastrostomy and double-tract reconstruction.
RESULTS: In 1 case, postoperative period was complicated by subcompensated stenosis of the right ureter due to hematoma near the right common iliac artery. This event required endoscopic stenting of the right ureter with positive effect. Both patients were discharged in 16 and 23 days after surgery.
CONCLUSION: This method may be alternative to modern reconstructions. Currently, digestive tract reconstruction after gastrectomy is still important and requires further study. Simultaneous procedures in patients with cancer and cardiovascular disease became more widespread. To objectify our statements, further research is needed.
