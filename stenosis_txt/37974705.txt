Abstract: UNLABELLED: Yoga is becoming way of life world over to stay fit and agile both physically and mentally. Sutra neti is an ancient yoga practice in which a thread/tube is passed through nostrils and taken out through mouth and is then moved back and forth. This technique is believed to clean nasal passages and is considered relatively safe. We report a case of nasopharyngeal stenosis caused due to this ancient practice. People and yoga trainers all over the world should be made aware of this complication of sutra neti as it is difficult to treat and has high recurrence rate.
