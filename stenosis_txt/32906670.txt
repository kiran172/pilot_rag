Title: Fetal Cardiac Interventions-Polish Experience from "Zero" to the Third World Largest Program.

Abstract: This article presents the technical aspects of the Polish fetal cardiac interventions (FCI) program, including preparation of the team and modifications in the technique of the procedure that aim to increase its safety for the mother and the fetus. Over 9 years, 128 FCI in 113 fetuses have been performed: 94 balloon aortic valvuloplasties (fBAV), 14 balloon atrioseptoplasties (fBAS) with stent (BAS+), 5 balloon atrioseptoplasties without stent placement (BAS-), and 15 fetal pulmonary valvuloplasties (fBPS). The technical success rate ranged from 80% (BAS-) to 89% (fBAV), while the procedure-related death rate (defined as death within 72 hours following the procedure) ranged from 7% (fBAV and fBPV) to 20% (BAS). There were 98 live births after all FCI (3 pregnancies continue). Median gestational age at delivery was 39 weeks in our center and 38 weeks in other centers.
