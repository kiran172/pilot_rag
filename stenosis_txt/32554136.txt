Title: 30-Day readmission rates, diagnoses, and risk factors following pediatric airway surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the last few decades, the increased survival of premature infants and critically ill children have led to the increased frequency and complexity of pediatric airway procedures. Minimizing readmission rates following these procedures is important to maximize health outcomes and cost effectiveness. This study examines the incidence, reasons, and risk factors for hospital readmissions following pediatric airway surgeries in a large, nationally representative sample.
METHODS: Pediatric airway surgeries performed across 22 states in 2014 were identified using data from the Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD). Airway surgeries were identified and categorized using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes into the following categories: tracheostomy, repair of larynx, repair of trachea, laryngeal excision, tracheal excision, bronchoscopy, laryngoscopy, laryngotracheal diagnostic procedures, other operations on larynx, and other operations on trachea. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors significantly correlated with readmissions.
RESULTS: 10,289 pediatric airway procedures over 7120 visits were identified. 954 readmissions were identified for an overall readmission rate of 13.4%. 613 of these readmissions were related to the initial procedure, yielding a relevant readmission rate of 8.6%. On univariate analysis, factors that varied significantly with readmission rates included number of diagnoses on record (OR 1.06), number of chronic conditions (OR 1.18), number of procedures (OR 1.07), public insurance status (OR 1.39), bottom quartile median household income in patient zip code (OR 1.29), teaching hospital status (OR 1.60), and chronic perinatal respiratory disease (OR 1.45). On multivariate analysis, significant predictors included number of diagnoses (OR 1.02), number of chronic conditions (OR 1.13), and bottom quartile median household income in patient zip code (OR 1.20). The most common categories for readmission were respiratory distress (36%), infection (24%), and pneumonia (14%). The top overall individual reasons for readmission were stenosis of larynx (7.3%) and pneumonia (5.9%).
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric airway surgeries have relatively high rates of readmission. Strategies to reduce readmissions should involve addressing health disparities and employing a multidisciplinary approach to improve care for medically complex patients.
