Title: [Disorders of the Lacrimal Apparatus, Part 2: Basics of Therapy].

Abstract: The tearing eye (epiphora) is deemed to be the leading symptome of efferent tear duct stenosis. Nevertheless, epiphora might be caused by ocular surface pathologies or even intraocular diseases. A distinguished anamnesis and sufficient clinical examination is most meaningful for the differential diagnostic distinction. Therapy is based on pathologic changes. In case of ocular surface disease, a suitable tear substitution and antiinflammatory approach is mandatory. Multifarious triggers have to be considered as well. Addressing tear film distribution, suitable oculoplastic surgery is required. Efferent tear duct stenosis necessitates surgical treatment as the level of suffering is often very high and acute exacerbations may develop.â€ŠBesides recanalization, anastomosing techniques represent the available therapeutic principles. Possible surgical approaches offer a great variety and many influencing factors navigate therapy decisions. This part of the review comments on the most important therapeutic approaches for lacrimal apparatus diseases.
