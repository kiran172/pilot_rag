Title: Portomesenteric and portosystemic venous reconstructions in children using balloon-expandable endoprostheses.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Portomesenteric and portosystemic venous occlusive disease may lead to portomesenteric hypertension, variceal bleeding, ascites and hypersplenism. Data regarding endovascular reconstructive strategies in children, however, are limited.
OBJECTIVE: To report technical success, outcome and patency of portomesenteric and portosystemic venous reconstruction using VIABAHN VBX balloon-expandable endoprostheses in pediatric patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five pediatric patients (median age: 15 years, range: 4-18 years), including 3 (60%) boys and 2 (40%) girls, with portomesenteric or portosystemic venous occlusion or recurrent stenosis, underwent balloon-expandable stent graft reconstruction. Presenting symptoms included acute variceal bleeding, without (n = 2, 40%) or with (n = 1, 20%) splenomegaly, and transfusion-dependent chronic melena (n = 1, 20%). One patient was asymptomatic (n = 1, 20%). Preprocedural imaging included Doppler ultrasound and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) in all patients. Initial imaging showed 4 (80%) occlusions and 1 (20%) recurrent stenosis greater than 50%. Technical aspects of the reconstructions, technical successes, clinical outcomes and adverse events were recorded. Technical success was defined as completion of stent graft reconstruction. Adverse events were categorized according to Society of Interventional Radiology criteria. Clinical success was defined as resolution of the presenting symptoms and/or prevention of portal hypertensive sequela.
RESULTS: Venous reconstruction was technically successful in all five patients. Stent graft locations included the main portal vein in 2 (40%), the superior mesenteric vein in 1 (20%), autologous Meso-Rex shunt in 1 (20%) and splenocaval shunt in 1 (20%). Six stent grafts were placed (two stent grafts placed in a single patient). Stent grafts had a median diameter of 7 mm (range: 6-10 mm) and a median length of 59 mm (range: 19-79 mm). Median fluoroscopy time was 36.6 min (range: 13.4-95.8 min) and median air kerma was 301.0 mGy (range: 218.0-1,148.2 mGy). No adverse events occurred. Median clinical follow-up was 18 months (range: 6-29 months). Median imaging follow-up was 17 months (range: 2-29 months). Clinical success was achieved in all patients and maintained during the follow-up period. One patient required follow-up intervention with superior mesenteric vein side extension with a self-expanding bare metal stent due to perigraft stenosis detected on CT 3 months after stent placement. There were no stent graft occlusions.
CONCLUSION: Portomesenteric and portosystemic venous reconstruction using balloon-expandable stent grafts in pediatric patients was feasible and clinically successful in this preliminary experience. Additional studies are warranted.
