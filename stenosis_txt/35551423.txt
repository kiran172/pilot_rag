Title: Association between vascular calcification in intracranial vertebrobasilar circulation and luminal stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The study aims to assess the correlation and association between calcium burden and luminal stenosis in the vertebrobasilar circulation.
METHODS: We evaluated 166 patients [mean age, 79.8 ± 8.8 (SD) with 93 males] with stroke symptoms. The calcification patterns were assessed on non-contrast CT (NCCT); quantitative calcium burden [Agatston-Janowitz (AJ) calcium score, volume, and mass] on the initial non-contrast phase of CT perfusion (CTP); and the qualitative and quantitative luminal stenosis on CT angiography (CTA) studies. We calculated the correlation coefficient and association between measures of calcium burden and luminal stenosis.
RESULTS: Two hundred twenty-eight of 498 arteries (45.8%) had detectable calcification on NCCT and measurable stenosis in 169 of 498 arteries (33.9%) on CTA. We found a moderate correlation between qualitative calcium burden and qualitative (0.51 for R1 and 0.62 for R2, p < 0.01) as well as quantitative luminal stenosis (0.67 for R1 and 0.69 for R2, p < 0.01). There was a moderate correlation of AJ score (0.66), volume (0.68), and mass of calcification (0.60, p < 0.01) with luminal stenosis measurements. The quantitative calcium burden and luminal stenosis showed statistically significant differences between different qualitative categories of calcium burden (p < 0.001 in both readers). However, severe stenosis was not seen even with the advanced circumferential wall calcification (mean stenosis of 35.3-40.7%).
CONCLUSION: Our study showed a moderate correlation between higher burden of vascular calcification and the degree of luminal stenosis. However, higher calcium burden and circumferential wall calcification were not associated with severe luminal stenosis.
