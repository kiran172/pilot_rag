Title: Pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis associated with thoracolumbar spinal stenosis: a rare case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pectus excavatum is the most common congenital chest wall defect. Thoracolumbar spinal stenosis and kyphoscoliosis was seen in patients with pectus excavatum. It can be caused by ossification of the ligamentum flavum, which is rare in patients with pectus excavatum.
CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a 26-year-old woman presented bilateral lower extremities weakness and numbness for two months, progressive worsening. She was diagnosed as thoracolumbar spinal stenosis with ossification of the ligamentum flavum, thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis associated with pectus excavatum. The posterior instrumentation, decompression with laminectomy, and de-kyposis procedure with multilevel ponte osteotomy were performed. Her postoperative course was uneventful and followed up regularly. Good neurologic symptoms improvement and spinal alignment were achieved.
CONCLUSIONS: Pectus excavatum, kyphoscoliosis associated with thoracolumbar spinal stenosis is rare, and thus her treatment options are very challengeable. Extensive laminectomy decompression and de-kyphosis procedures can achieve good improvement of neurologic impingement and spinal alignment.
