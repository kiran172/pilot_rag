Title: Diagnosis and Treatment of Radioactive Iodine-Induced Sialadenitis: A 10-Year Endoscopic Experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the endoscopic characteristics of radioactive iodine-induced sialadenitis (RAIS), and to evaluate the treatment outcomes of endoscopic intervention for RAIS.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Eighty-two consecutive patients (11 males and 71 females) diagnosed as RAIS from Nov. 2012 to Sep. 2023 were retrospectively included. All patients underwent endoscopic exploration and intervention of the affected glands. The endoscopic features were collected, and treatment outcomes were followed-up and evaluated through post to pre-operative comparisons of gland status.
RESULTS: Overall, endoscopic procedures were undertaken for 162 parotid glands (PGs) and 62 submandibular glands (SMGs). Endoscopy showed severe lumen stricture (49.3%) and ductal atresia (23.5%) in PGs, as well as severe stenosis of the anterior duct and ectasia of the proximal duct (59.7%) in SMGs. During a median six months' follow-up, the treatment outcomes of PGs were evaluated as "improvement" in 23.4%，"lesion maintenance" in 45.1% and "lesion aggravation" in 31.5% of the glands. As for SMGs, the treatment outcomes were scored as "improvement"in 29.0%，"lesion maintenance"in 54.8%, and"lesion aggravation"in 16.1% of the glands. No significant differences of treatment outcomes were found relative to RAI treatment sessions and cumulative dosage.
CONCLUSION: RAIS is characteristic of severe lumen stricture and ductal atresia in PGs, and stenosis of the distal duct and ectasia of the proximal duct in SMGs. Endoscopy can alleviate clinical symptoms of RAIS and help to preserve the gland function.
