Title: "TAVI: Valve in valve. A new field for structuralists? Literature review".

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) led to the foundation of the subspecialty of structural heart interventions and created an emerging area of clinical and technical issues. Soon after TAVI introduction into clinical practice, boundaries were expanded with utilization of valve-in-valve (V-i-V) techniques. V-i-V comprised a diverse subset of patients including TAVI within TAVI, TAVI within a degenerated surgically implanted bioprosthesis, or even TAVI-in-TAVI-in-surgical bioprosthesis. In the present review, we summarize the available literature and present initial experience on the field in Greece.
