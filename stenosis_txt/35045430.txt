Title: [A Case of Advanced Gastric Cancer-Recurrence of Skin Metastasis Nine Years after Surgery and Rectal Stenosis Due to Peritoneal Dissemination Ten Years Later].

Abstract: A 70-year-old man previously underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy for gastric cancer in 2010 and pathological diagnoses were pT4a, pN3, M0, pStage â…¢C. The postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy was interrupted due to nausea, but the patient had no apparent recurrence within 5 years after gastrectomy. In 2019, a swelling appeared from the left inguinal region to the scrotum, and MRI scan showed subcutaneous edematous changes in the same region. Biopsy showed adenocarcinoma and we diagnosed a recurrence of gastric cancer with skin metastasis. In November 2020, the patient complained of defecation disorder, and CT scan showed a circumferential wall thickening with contrast effect in the rectum. Although colonoscopy revealed rectal stenosis, biopsy specimen showed no malignant findings. We suspected rectal stenosis due to peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer and performed a colostomy. Intraoperative findings showed that the rectal wall was remarkably thickened with serosal erythema. Adenocarcinoma cells were found from the cytology of ascites. The patient was treated with nab-paclitaxel plus ramucirumab, then treated with nivolumab after failure of first-line therapy.
