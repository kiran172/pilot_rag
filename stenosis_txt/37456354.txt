Title: Balloon Aortic Valvuloplasty in the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Era.

Abstract: As the population continues to grow, and life expectancy has increased, aortic stenosis (AS) has become the most common valvular disease requiring surgical treatment. The evolution of valve replacement therapies has progressed significantly since 1960. In the last 20 years, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has been a game changer, and has potential to become the standard of care. Despite uncertain prognosis benefits, balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) can be useful in a broad range of patients with AS, as well as being a bridging therapy to valve replacement, or as a destination therapy, besides its role in TAVI procedures. This review describes the contemporary role of BAV in AS treatment, and focuses on technical improvements that reframe BAV as an effective tool in a variety of clinical scenarios. One of these improvements is transradial BAV, either with the conventional approach of BAV or applying the bilateral technique with two balloons.
