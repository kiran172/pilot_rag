Title: Extracranial Carotid Plaque Calcification and Cerebrovascular Ischemia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although coronary calcification quantification is an established approach for cardiovascular risk assessment, the value of quantifying carotid calcification is less clear. As a result, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between extracranial carotid artery plaque calcification burden and ipsilateral cerebrovascular ischemic events.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed in the following databases: Ovid MEDLINE(R) 1946 to July 6, 2022; OVID Embase 1974 to July 6, 2022; and The Cochrane Library (Wiley). We performed meta-analyses including studies in which investigators performed a computed tomography assessment of calcification volume, percentage, or other total calcium burden summarizable in a single continuous imaging biomarker and determined the association of these features with the occurrence of ipsilateral stroke or transient ischemic attack.
RESULTS: Our overall meta-analysis consisted of 2239 carotid arteries and 9 studies. The presence of calcification in carotid arteries ipsilateral to ischemic stroke or in stroke patients compared with asymptomatic patients did not demonstrate a significant association with ischemic cerebrovascular events (relative risk of 0.75 [95% CI, 0.44-1.28]; P=0.29). When restricted to studies of significant carotid artery stenosis (&gt;50%), the presence of calcification was associated with a reduced risk of ischemic stroke (relative risk of 0.56 [95% CI, 0.38-0.85]; P=0.006). When the analysis was limited to studies of patients with mainly nonstenotic plaques, there was an increased relative risk of ipsilateral ischemic stroke of 1.72 ([95% CI, 1.01-2.91]; P=0.04). Subgroup meta-analyses of total calcium burden and morphological features of calcium showed wide variability in their strength of association with ischemic stroke and demonstrated significant heterogeneity.
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of calcification in carotid plaque confers a reduced association with ipsilateral ischemic events, although these results seem to be limited among carotid arteries with higher degrees of stenosis. Adoption of carotid calcification measures in clinical decision-making will require additional studies providing more reproducible and standardized methods of calcium characterization and testing these imaging strategies in prospective studies.
