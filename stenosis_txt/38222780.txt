Title: Comparative analysis of Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine and inflammatory markers in diabetic and non-diabetic coronary artery disease patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of death worldwide, and India contributes to about one-fifth of total CAD deaths. The development of CAD has been linked to the accumulation of Nε-carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) in heart muscle, which correlates with fibrosis.
AIM: To assess the impact of CML and inflammatory markers on the biochemical and cardiovascular characteristics of CAD patients with and without diabetes.
METHODS: We enrolled 200 consecutive CAD patients who were undergoing coronary angiography and categorized them into two groups based on their serum glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (group I: HbA1c ≥ 6.5; group II: HbA1c < 6.5). We analyzed the levels of lipoproteins, plasma HbA1c levels, CML, interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and nitric oxide.
RESULTS: Group I (81 males and 19 females) patients had a mean age of 54.2 ± 10.2 years, with a mean diabetes duration of 4.9 ± 2.2 years. Group II (89 males and 11 females) patients had a mean age of 53.2 ± 10.3 years. Group I had more severe CAD, with a higher percentage of patients with single vessel disease and greater stenosis severity in the left anterior descending coronary artery compared to group II. Group I also exhibited a larger left atrium diameter. Group I patients exhibited significantly higher levels of CML, TNF-α, and IL-6 and lower levels of nitric oxide as compared with group II patients. Additionally, CML showed a significant positive correlation with IL-6 (r = 0.596, P = 0.001) and TNF-α (r = 0.337, P = 0.001) and a negative correlation with nitric oxide (r=-4.16, P = 0.001). Odds ratio analysis revealed that patients with CML in the third quartile (264.43-364.31 ng/mL) were significantly associated with diabetic CAD at unadjusted and adjusted levels with covariates.
CONCLUSION: CML and inflammatory markers may play a significant role in the development of CAD, particularly in diabetic individuals, and may serve as potential biomarkers for the prediction of CAD in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients.
