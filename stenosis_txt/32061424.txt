Title: Development of Ureteral Stenosis/Obstruction in Kidney Transplant.

Abstract: This retrospective study describes the incidence and prevalence of ureteral stenosis/obstruction (US/O) in a cohort of 334 renal transplants recipients in our center over the last 5 years and evaluates the risk factors that may influence the occurrence of US/O. The parameters studied included the following: history of prostate disease, smoking, urinary tract infection, renal lithiasis, ureterovesical reflux, presence and level of polar artery, type of ureterovesical anastomosis, delayed graft function, double J catheter, lymphocele, urinoma, acute rejection, prolonged catheterization, post-transplant infravesical obstruction and BK virus infection, age of the donor and recipient, and months on dialysis. Also evaluated were the nadir creatinine and instances of cold ischemia, asystole, reanastomosis, and double J catheter removal. The average incidence of US/O was 7.6% and was significantly correlated with factors of alteration of the uretero-bladder dynamics without finding a relation to vascular factors.
