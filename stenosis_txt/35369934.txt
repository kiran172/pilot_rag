Title: Prevalence, Predictors, and Outcomes of Patients With ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction and Angiographically Significant Coronary Artery Disease of Non-Infarct-Related Artery.

Abstract: Patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) can present with angiographically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) of non-infarct-related artery (IRA) or with IRA-only CAD. This study aimed to evaluate the prevalence, predictors, and outcome of patients with STEMI and angiographically significant CAD of non-IRA. All consecutive patients with STEMI who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention between 2000 and 2020 were included. Angiographically significant CAD was defined as >50% stenosis of the left main coronary artery and/or >90% stenosis for all other coronary arteries. A total of 2,663 patients had IRA-only CAD (80.2%) and 657 had angiographically significant non-IRA CAD (19.8%). Independent predictors for non-IRA CAD were male gender (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 to 1.70, p = 0.021), age >50 years (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.91, p = 0.007), and diabetes mellitus (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.9, p <0.001), whereas smoking (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.99, p = 0.004) and family history of CAD (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.98, p = 0.032) were found to be negatively associated with non-IRA CAD. In-hospital 30-day and 1- and 5-year all-cause mortality were higher in patients with non-IRA CAD compared with IRA-only CAD (5.8% vs 2.5%, 8.5% vs 3.3%, 18.4% vs 7.6% and 36.3% vs 20.3%, respectively; p for all <0.001). In conclusion, 20% of patients with STEMI had angiographically significant non-IRA CAD. Older age, male gender, and diabetes mellitus were independent predictors for non-IRA CAD, whereas smoking and family history of CAD predicted IRA-only CAD. The presence of non-IRA CAD was associated with higher short- and long-term all-cause mortality rates.
