Title: A rare association of subclavian steal syndrome with bilateral carotid artery stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: Bilateral carotid artery stenosis in the context of subclavian steal syndrome is an extremely rare finding. We report the case of a 75-year-old woman who presented with a transient ischemic attack. Bilateral internal carotid stenosis associated with left subclavian steal syndrome was diagnosed. Left internal carotid endarterectomy was performed under locoregional anesthesia. Inflation of a blood pressure cuff reversed the neurologic symptoms that appeared after internal carotid clamping. This rarely reported case remains a challenge to diagnose and treat because of its complex mechanisms and multiple risk factors. Our case highlights the importance of the surgical strategy adopted and the need for a good initial assessment.
