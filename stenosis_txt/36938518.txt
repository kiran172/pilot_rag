Title: Hospital admissions for mitral stenosis in pregnancy in the United States: a thirteen-year analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac conditions are a significant cause of maternal morbidity and mortality, significantly exacerbated during the hemodynamic demands of pregnancy. Mitral stenosis in pregnancy (MSp) is rare in the USA however, it has a high risk for maternal complications.
METHODS: We aim to outline the burden of MSp hospitalizations nationally. A retrospective review of HCUP/NIS data from 2002-2014 was conducted.
RESULTS: There were 2014 weighted discharges for both pregnancy and mitral stenosis (MS). Patients diagnosed with MS had a more considerable mean cost per discharge than the comparison group. Pulmonary Hypertension (PH), Atrial Arrhythmias (AA), Stroke, and Heart Failure (HF) were respectively reported in 25.71%, 7.14%, 0.95%, and 19.28% of the discharges. Our study identified a low incidence of MS in the US over the 12-year period; no deaths were identified.
CONCLUSION: Our results substantiate MSp as a risk factor for PH, AA, HF, and stroke in pregnancy. Even though the mortality is low, it is essential that clinicians be aware of this diagnosis due to higher associated morbidity and costs.
