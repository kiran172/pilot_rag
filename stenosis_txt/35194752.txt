Title: Three-dimensional Fusion of Myocardial Perfusion SPECT and Invasive Coronary Angiography Guides Coronary Revascularization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: SPECT myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT MPI) and invasive coronary angiography (ICA) provide complementary clinical information in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). We have developed an approach for 3D fusion of perfusion data from SPECT MPI and coronary anatomy from ICA. In this study, we aimed to evaluate its clinical value when compared to the traditional side-by-side readings.
METHODS: Thirty-six CAD patients who had at least one stenosis ≥ 50% were retrospectively enrolled. Based on the presence of a perfusion defect in a territory subtended by a coronary vessel, all vessels were classified as matched, unmatched, or normal groups via both the fusion and side-by-side analysis. The treatments recommended by the fusion and side-by-side analysis were compared with those that the patients received. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as all-cause death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring hospitalization, and unplanned revascularization, were assessed.
RESULTS: The overall vessel-based concordance was 78.7% between the fusion and side-by-side analysis. Compared with the side-by-side analysis, 23 coronary arteries (29 equivocal segments) of 19 patients were reclassified via fusion of data. In the matched, unmatched, and normal groups, the numbers of vessels with hemodynamically significant stenosis which caused reversible defect were 37 vs 53, 28 vs 14, and 43 vs 41 (P < .01) when comparing the side-by-side analysis with the fusion, and the revascularization ratios per vessel were 69% vs 88%, 29% vs 10%, and 2% vs 2% between them. During the five-year follow-up, 8 patients (22.2%) experienced MACE. Patients who received the same treatment as the guidance of 3D fusion results (n = 22) had superior outcomes when compared with those who did not (n = 14) (P < .01).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the side-by-side analysis, the 3D fusion of SPECT MPI and ICA provided incremental diagnostic and prognostic value.
