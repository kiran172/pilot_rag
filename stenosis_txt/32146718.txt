Title: Minimally Invasive Pediatric Surgery: The Learning Curve.

Abstract: The use of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) in pediatric patients has increased over the past decades. The process of mastering a new procedure is termed the learning curve, during which the ability to operate increases but poorer outcomes are produced. We aim to analyze the current evidence on learning curves in pediatric MIS and evaluate its impact on patient's clinical outcomes. A systematic literature search was performed for studies listed on PubMed that reported on the learning curve for MIS surgical procedures. Studies were included if they stated the number of procedures required to reach a consistency in outcomes or if they compared outcomes between early and late period of MIS experience regarding the endpoints operative time, conversions, and intra-/postoperative complications. A total of 22 articles reporting on 11 surgical procedures were included in the study. Most authors reported a significant decrease in operative time as well as peri- and postoperative complications with increasing experience of the surgeon. Complications ranged from minor to major, the latter being especially severe for patients receiving pyloromyotomy (5-7% higher risk of mucosal perforation), esophageal atresia repair (15% higher leakage rate and 19-77% higher stenosis rate), or Kasai portoenterostomy (26-35% more liver transplants in the first year after surgery) during the learning curve period. Pediatric MIS comes with a considerable learning curve that may have a significant impact on the patient's clinical outcomes. Efforts should be made to minimize the effect of the learning curve on the patients.
