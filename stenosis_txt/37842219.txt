Title: Can Neonatal Pull-through Replace Staged Pull-through for the Management of Anorectal Malformation? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: Anorectal malformations (ARMs) are managed classically in three stages - colostomy at birth, anorectal pull-through after 2-3 months, and stoma closure. Single-stage pull-through has been contemplated in neonatal age aimed to reduce the number of procedures, better long-term continence, the better psycho-social status of the child, and reduced cost of treatment, especially in resource-strained countries. We conducted a systematic review comparing neonatal single-stage pull-through with stage pull-through and did a meta-analysis for the outcome and complications. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were followed. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched and RevMan 5.4.1 was used for the meta-analysis. Fourteen comparative studies including one randomized controlled trial were included in the systematic review for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis included 1845 patients including 866 neonates undergoing single-stage pull-through. There was no statistically significant difference for the occurrence of surgical site infection (odds ratio [OR] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24-2.83), urinary tract injury (OR 1.82, 95% CI: 0.85-3.89), rectal prolapse (OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.21-5.04), anal stenosis/stricture, voluntary bowel movements (OR 0.97, 95% CI: 0.25-3.73), constipation (OR 1.01, 95% CI: 0.61-1.67), soiling (OR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.52-1.51), mortality (OR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.04-39.74), or other complications. However, continence was seen to be better among patients undergoing neonatal pull-through (OR 1.63, 95% CI: 1.12-2.38). Thus, we can recommend single-stage pull-through for managing patients with ARMs in the neonatal age.
