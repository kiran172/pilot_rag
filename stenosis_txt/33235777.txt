Title: Barium aspiration - Accident or complication?

Abstract: Aspiration of barium sulfate is possible during radiographic contrast procedures and is potentially life-threatening in severe cases. In patients with dysphagia or suspected tracheoesophageal fistula, barium compounds may be used, considering lateral projection fluoroscopy of the pharyngeal phase of swallowing, but iso-osmotic agents should also be considered.
