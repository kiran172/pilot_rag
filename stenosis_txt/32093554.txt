Title: Atrioventricular Valve Function Predicts Reintervention in Complete Atrioventricular Septal Defect.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Technical performance score (TPS) has been associated with both early and late outcomes across a wide range of congenital cardiac procedures. A previous study has shown that the presence of residual lesions before discharge, as measured by TPS, is accurately able to identify patients who required postdischarge reinterventions after complete atrioventricular septal defect (CAVSD) repair. The aim of this study is to determine which subcomponents of TPS best predict postdischarge reinterventions after CAVSD repair.
METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective review of patients with CAVSD after repair between January 2000 and March 2016. We assigned TPS (class 1, no residua; class 2, minor residua; class 3, major residua or reintervention before discharge for residua) based on subcomponent scores from discharge echocardiograms. Outcome of interest was postdischarge reintervention.
RESULTS: Among 344 patients, median age was 3.2 months (interquartile range [IQR], 2.4-4.2). There were 34 (10%) postdischarge reinterventions. Median follow-up was 2.6 years (IQR, 0.09-7.9). Trisomy 21 and concomitant procedure were associated with postdischarge reinterventions. After adjusting for these factors, among the subcomponents, left atrioventricular valve stenosis and regurgitation, right atrioventricular valve regurgitation, residual ventricular septal defect, and abnormal conduction at discharge were significantly associated with postdischarge reinterventions.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the ability of TPS to predict postdischarge reinterventions in patients who underwent CAVSD repair. Residual left and right atrioventricular valve regurgitation and abnormal conduction at discharge were among the subcomponents strongly associated with postdischarge reinterventions. Thus, TPS may aid clinicians in identifying children at higher risk for reintervention.
