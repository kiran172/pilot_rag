Title: Hypoattenuated Leaflet Thickening-Associated Myocardial Infarction: A Rare Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT), a potential aftereffect of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedure, may affect valve performance and clinical outcomes. At this moment we describe an elderly patient who, despite being on prophylactic antiplatelet medication for previous percutaneous intervention (PCI) for coronary artery disease (CAD) and a self-expanding valve in-situ for aortic stenosis (TAVR), presented to the emergency room with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), probably as a result of a thromboembolic event from HALT. The case highlights the significance of considering HALT-associated thromboembolism as a potential cause of myocardial infarction (MI) in post-TAVR patients.
