Title: High-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging-guided endovascular recanalization for nonacute intracranial artery occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: On the basis of the characteristics of occluded segments on high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging (MR-VWI), the authors evaluated the role of high-resolution MR-VWI-guided endovascular recanalization for patients with symptomatic nonacute intracranial artery occlusion (ICAO).
METHODS: Consecutive patients with symptomatic nonacute ICAO that was refractory to aggressive medical treatment were prospectively enrolled and underwent endovascular recanalization. High-resolution MR-VWI was performed before the recanalization intervention. The characteristics of the occluded segments on MR-VWI, including signal intensity, occlusion morphology, occlusion angle, and occlusion length, were evaluated. Technical success was defined as arterial recanalization with modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 2b or 3 and residual stenosis < 50%. Perioperative complications were recorded. The characteristics of the occluded segments on MR-VWI were compared between the recanalized group and the failure group.
RESULTS: Twenty-five patients with symptomatic nonacute ICAO that was refractory to aggressive medical treatment were consecutively enrolled from April 2020 to February 2021. Technical success was achieved in 19 patients (76.0%). One patient (4.0%) had a nondisabling ischemic stroke during the perioperative period. Multivariable logistic analysis showed that successful recanalization of nonacute ICAO was associated with occlusion with residual lumen (OR 0.057, 95% CI 0.004-0.735, p = 0.028) and shorter occlusion length (OR 0.853, 95% CI 0.737-0.989, p = 0.035).
CONCLUSIONS: The high-resolution MR-VWI modality could be used to guide endovascular recanalization for nonacute ICAO. Occlusion with residual lumen and shorter occlusion length on high-resolution MR-VWI were identified as predictors of technical success of endovascular recanalization for nonacute ICAO.
