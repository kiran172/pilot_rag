Title: Thoracic Spinal Stenosis From Calcified Ligamentum Flavum.

Abstract: Background: Calcification of the ligamentum flavum is a rare cause of spinal stenosis. The process can occur at any level in the spine, often presents with local pain or radicular symptoms, and is a distinct process from ossification of the spinal ligaments in pathogenesis and treatment approach. Few case reports have described multiple level involvement in the thoracic spine that results in sensorimotor deficits and myelopathy. Case Report: A 37-year-old female presented with progressive sensorimotor deficits from T3 distally that resulted in complete sensory deficits and diminished lower extremity strength. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated calcification of the ligamentum flavum from T2-T12 with severe spinal stenosis at T3-T4. She underwent T2-T12 posterior laminectomy with ligamentum flavum resection. Postoperatively, she had complete motor strength return and was discharged home for outpatient therapy. Her residual sensory deficits continued to improve with time after decompression and excision of the calcified ligamentum flavum. Conclusion: This case is unique in that the calcific process involved nearly the entire thoracic spine. The patient had dramatic improvement in her symptoms following resection of the involved levels. The case adds a severe manifestation of calcification of the ligamentum flavum with a surgical outcome to the literature.
