Title: [Genetic Factors of Intracranial Artery Stenosis and Potential for Personalized Medicine].

Abstract: It has been verified that the missense variant c.14429G&gt;A(p.Arg4810Lys, rs112735431)of RNF213(Ringer finger protein 213)is significantly associated with intracranial artery stenosis(ICAS). The clinical features of ICAS with RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys are also becoming clear. In addition, RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys has been found to be associated with coronary artery stenosis/renal artery stenosis and pulmonary hypertension, and has been attracting attention as a variant that causes systemic vascular disease. Functional analysis of RNF213 is also progressing, but the mechanism involved in disease onset has not yet been clarified, and further analysis is expected for the realization of personalized medicine for ICAS.
