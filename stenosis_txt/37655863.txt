Title: Implantation of an arteriovenous graft through the peripheral vascular access in the presence of superior vena cava stenosis but a patent azygos vein: A case report.

Abstract: Long-term indwelling central venous catheters (CVCs) may cause complications, such as central venous disease (CVD). CVD eliminates the possibility of establishing new arteriovenous access. We herein describe a case in which an arteriovenous graft (AVG) is implanted through the peripheral veins and blood flows back to the patent azygos vein, secondary to superior vena cava stenosis. This shows that if the CVD is correctable or the collateral circulation is an alternative vascular pathway that allows blood to return back to the right atrium, the internal fistula flow is well-balanced with the collateral circulation and there are no clinical symptoms of CVD, an arteriovenous access can be established for the operation. This provides a viable, long-term vascular access option for hemodialysis patients with central venous resource depletion.
