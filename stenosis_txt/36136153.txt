Title: Outcome assessment of biliary stricture repair following cholecystectomy in a tertiary care centre.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Bile duct injuries (BDIs) are the potential grievous complications of cholecystectomy that result in substantial morbidity and mortality. Outcomes of BDI management depend on multiple factors such as the type and extent of injury, timing of repair, and surgical expertise. The present retrospective study was conducted to analyse the risk factors associated with the BDI repair outcomes.
METHODS: The data of patients having primary or recurrent bile duct stricture following BDI from 1985 to 2018 were retrospectively evaluated.
RESULTS: A total of 268 patients underwent hepaticojejunostomy (HJ). Of the total, 218 patients had primary bile duct stricture, and 50 patients had HJ stricture. The most commonly performed procedure for primary BDI was Roux-en-Y HJ (RYHJ), followed by right hepatectomy, right posterior sectionectomy, and left hepatectomy. All patients with strictured HJ underwent RYHJ, except one who underwent a right hepatectomy. Outcome assessment using the McDonald grading system showed that 62%, 27%, 5%, and 6% of patients with primary bile duct stricture had grade A, grade B, grade C, and grade D complications, respectively, with a mortality rate of 3.21%, whereas 46%, 34%, and 18% patients with strictured HJ had grade A, grade B, and grade C complications, respectively, with a mortality rate of 2%. High-up biliary strictures, early repair, and blood loss > 350 mL are the surrogate markers for failure of repair.
CONCLUSION: Management of BDI needs a multidisciplinary approach. The outcomes of both primary biliary stricture and strictured HJ can be improved with management of patients in a tertiary care centre. However, attempts to repair within 2 weeks of injury, Strasberg E<sub>4</sub> and E<sub>5</sub>, and blood loss of &gt; 350 mL may have an adverse effect on the outcome of HJ.
