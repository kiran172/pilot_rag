Title: An apparently healthy female British shorthair cat with a rare complication of colonic stenosis after flank approach ovariohysterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Colonic stenosis is a rare postoperative complication of ovariohysterectomy in cats, leading to dyschezia and fecal diameter reduction. In cats, while there are reports of colonic stenosis after midline approach ovariohysterectomy, there are no specific reports of flank approach ovariohysterectomy.
CASE PRESENTATION: This report describes a severe case of a one-year-old British shorthair female cat presenting with gastrointestinal signs, including dyschezia and reduced fecal diameter, three weeks after flank approach ovariohysterectomy. Despite abdominal radiography, proctography with barium sulfate, colonoscopy, CT, and hematological analysis, the cause of colonic stenosis remained unclear. During exploratory laparotomy, an annular tissue band was found encircling the descending colon, resulting in severe local stenosis. After excision of the tissue band, the presenting clinical signs of the cat were rapidly improved. This result suggests that colonic stenosis caused by tissue band should be considered when diagnosing postoperative complications in flank approach ovariohysterectomy in cats.
CONCLUSION: Colon stenosis due to annular tissue band restriction should be considered one of the differentials for postoperative complications in flank approach ovariohysterectomy in cats.
