Title: Pediatric-Onset Relapsing Polychondritis With Otolaryngeal Manifestations.

Abstract: Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare autoimmune disease that can present with various clinical manifestations. Among the affected sites, the ear, nose, and throat cartilages are frequently involved, often leading to subtle and episodic symptoms that can be challenging to diagnose. A high index of suspicion is necessary for the early identification of these subtle signs, which can aid in early diagnosis and prompt management. In this report, we present a rare case of pediatric-onset relapsing polychondritis that was initially misdiagnosed as laryngotracheobronchitis.
