Title: Effectiveness of Tocilizumab in juvenile patients with refractory Takayasu arteritis: Two case reports.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a systemic large-vessel vasculitis which can be accompanied by the symptoms associated with vascular stenosis.
PATIENT CONCERNS: We describe 2 female juveniles with TA who presented with progressive intermittent claudication.
DIAGNOSIS: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed the stenosis of femoral arteries and increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and serum amyloid A (SAA) were noted in both patients. According to European league against rheumatism consensus criteria for the diagnosis of TA was confirmed in both patients.
INTERVENTIONS: Both patients had shown resistance to glucocorticoids and treated with tocilizumab (TCZ) (subcutaneous injections, 162â€Šmg/week).
OUTCOMES: These treatments improved claudication symptoms. Follow-up imaging by enhanced CT revealed restoration of advanced stenosis of the femoral arteries in both patients. They achieved normalization of levels of the acute-phase reactants CRP and SAA. Serum levels of interleukin-6 were increased transiently after TCZ injection, but declined to within normal ranges at 12 weeks.
LESSONS: Juvenile patients with TA presenting with advanced stenosis of the femoral arteries are not rare. The clinical courses of our patients suggested the beneficial effects of TCZ against the progressive vascular stenosis observed in refractory TA.
