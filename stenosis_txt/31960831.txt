Title: [Invasive functional assessment of coronary artery stenosis using fractional flow reserve].

Abstract: The presence of myocardial ischemia significantly affects prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. The fractional flow reserve (FFR) allows interventional cardiologists to evaluate whether an equivocal coronary artery stenosis is associated or not with myocardial ischemia, and therefore deserve to be properly treated. The present article has the purpose to provide the readers with an overview about the role of FFR in the diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease, as well as the potential related controversies. The coronary physiology on the basis of this tool is also provided together with all the procedural aspects useful in the catheterization laboratory. In addition, the landmark trials on the basis of the FFR application in different clinical settings and coronary anatomies will be described, together with the main improvements aiming at favoring a more extensive use of this invasive tool.
