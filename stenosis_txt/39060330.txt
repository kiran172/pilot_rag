Title: Comparison of clinical efficacy between modified Kamikawa anastomosis in laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y anastomosis in laparoscopic total gastrectomy.

Abstract: To investigate the short-term clinical efficacy of laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with modified Kamikawa anastomosis and laparoscopic total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis. Retrospective cohort study was conducted. The clinicopathological data of 268 patients who underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy for adenocarcinoma of esophagogastric junction and upper gastric adenocarcinoma from January 2016 to October 2022 were collected. Among 268 patients, 26 underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with modified Kamikawa anastomosis were assigned to Kamikawa group and 242 underwent laparoscopic total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis were assigned to Roux-en-Y group. The sex, age, BMI, preoperative albumin, maximum tumor diameter, histological grade, and pathological stage of patients in the Kamikawa group and the Roux-en-Y group were subjected to 1:1 propensity score matching. After matching, 16 patients in Kamikawa group and Roux-en-Y group were respectively included in this study. Outcome measures: (1) Intraoperative condition. (2) Postoperative recovery. (3) Follow-up information. The patients' nutritional status, reflux esophagitis and anastomotic stoma were investigated by outpatient and telephone follow-up. Nutritional status assessment comprising body mass index and Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 score. (1) Intraoperative condition. All patients successfully underwent laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy and total gastrectomy. Compared with Roux-en-Y group, the digestive tract reconstruction time in Kamikawa group was longer 93.0(74.0-111.0)min vs. 39.7(35.1-46.2)min, t = -2.001, P = 0.055., and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in total operation time and intraoperative blood loss (P > 0.05). (2) Postoperative recovery. There was no statistically significant difference between Kamikawa group and Roux-en-Y group in first anal exhaust time, first postoperative liquid intake time, postoperative hospitalization time, and postoperative complications (P > 0.05). (3) Follow-up information. All patients were followed up. BMI and NRS 2002 scores in Kamikawa group were better than those in Roux-en-Y group at 6 and 12 months after surgery 22.9 ± 3.0 kg/m2 vs. 20.8 ± 2.2 kg/m2, t = 2.165, P = 0.038; 23.1 ± 3.0 kg/m2 vs. 20.3 ± 2.2 kg/m2, t = 3.022, P = 0.005 and 2 (1-2) vs. 2 (1-3), Z = -2.585, P = 0.010; 2 (1-2) vs. 2 (1-3), Z = -2.273, P = 0.023., the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference in GERD scale score and occurrence of ≥ Grade B reflux esophagitis at 6 and 12 months after surgery between Kamikawa group and Roux-en-Y group (P > 0.05). Anastomotic stenosis was not found in all patients by postoperative upper gastrointestinal angiography. Laparoscopic proximal gastrectomy with modified Kamikawa anastomosis is safe and feasible for the treatment of esophagogastric junction and upper gastric adenocarcinoma, and can achieve good anti-reflux effect. Besides, compared with traditional laparoscopic total gastrectomy, its postoperative nutritional status is better.
