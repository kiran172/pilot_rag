Title: Direct peroral cholangioscopy with conventional upper gastrointestinal endoscope.

Abstract: An 83-year-old male with a history of Whipple procedure (pancreatoduodenectomy) due to pancreatic cancer, underwent endoscopic retrograde colangiopancreatography (ERCP) for acute cholangitis. Because of the altered anatomy, an upper gastrointestinal endoscope was used. Severe stricture of the hepaticojejunal anastomosis was found. The anastomotic stricture was dilated with a 12mm through-the-scope (TTS) balloon under fluoroscopy and direct visualization. Right and left ducts were explored with Dormia basket and balloon, with extraction of bile duct stones and pus. Cholangioscopy with upper gastrointestinal endoscope was performed and residual cholesterol stones were identified in branches of the left hepatic duct and these were removed with the stone extraction balloon under endoscopic visualization. Ciprofloxacin was administered for 5 days and post interventional course was uneventful. Direct peroral colangioscopy using a conventional endoscope provides high quality endoscopic imaging, enabling access to virtual chromoendoscopy and the 2.8 mm diameter working channel allows for interventional procedures. This strategy is useful and economical, helping confirm clearance of common bile duct stones, while allowing extraction of any residual stones. New, cost effective scopes for peroral cholangioscopy are needed to improve the safety and success rate.
