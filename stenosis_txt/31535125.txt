Title: Pneumonectomy is necessary following delayed detection of pulmonary artery compromise.

Abstract: It has been previously suggested that lung tissue remains viable without blood supply from the pulmonary artery (PA). However, our experience demonstrates otherwise. We present 2 cases of accidental left lower lobe PA occlusion during upper lobectomy causing ischaemic changes to the remaining lung tissue. Both patients became septic secondary to necrosis of infarcted lung and required completion pneumonectomy. Development of collateral circulation to bypass the occluded PA may occur but is often insufficient to support the affected lung tissue. Unless the patient is medically unfit, resection of the ischaemic lung should be undertaken.
