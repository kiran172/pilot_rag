Title: Cardiovascular Characteristics and Progressions of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Pulmonary Stenosis in RASopathy Syndrome in the Genomic Era.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To investigate cardiovascular characteristics and progressions of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and pulmonary stenosis (PS) and determine whether any genotype-phenotype correlations exist in patients with gene-confirmed RASopathy syndrome.
STUDY DESIGN: Eighty patients (male, 55%) confirmed as having RASopathy syndrome by genetic testing at a single tertiary center were enrolled. Subjects' medical and echocardiography records were reviewed and the changes in the z scores of left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT) and the degree of PS over time were examined during follow-up of 5.7 ± 3.1 and 7.5 ± 5.2 years, respectively.
RESULTS: The most common RASopathy gene identified was PTPN11 (56%), followed by RAF1 (10%). Eighty-five percent of patients had cardiovascular diseases, wherein 42% had HCM, and 38% PS. Mean maximal LVWT z score on the initial echocardiography (mean age 5.0 ± 6.0 years) was 3.4 ± 1.3 (median 2.8, range 2.1-6.6) in the HCM group. Overall, the maximal LVWT increased with time, especially in the HCM group (z = 3.4 ± 1.3 to 3.7 ± 1.6, P = .008) and RAF1-variant group (z = 3.7 ± 1.7 to 4.6 ± 1.8, P = .031). Five patients newly developed HCM during the study period. Genotype-phenotype correlation was significant for HCM (P = .002); 31% of patients with PTPN11 and 88% with RAF1 variants had HCM. PS did not progress in this study cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, progression of ventricular hypertrophy was seen in a significant number of patients with genotype correlation. Thus, long-term follow up of cardiovascular problems in patients with RASopathy is necessary.
