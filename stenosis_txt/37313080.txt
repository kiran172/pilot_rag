Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy in a Polytrauma Patient With Subarachnoid Hemorrhage.

Abstract: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TCM) is a sudden, transient myocardial stunning precipitated by severe emotional or physical stress. It is characterized by left ventricular apical ballooning and elevated cardiac enzymes without significant coronary artery stenosis. Stress-induced catecholamine surge has been proposed to be the likely mechanism of TCM.Â We report the case of a 23-year-old female who presented to the emergency department unconscious and in respiratory distress following a motor vehicle accident. The point-of-care ultrasonography showed prominent B lines in bilateral lung fields and a dilated inferior vena cava (IVC). An x-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest revealed bilateral diffuse ground glass opacities. A CT scan of the brain showed a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Electrocardiography (ECG) showed normal sinus rhythm, but troponin I was elevated. Echocardiography revealed left ventricular apical hypokinesia. The coronary angiogram was normal. A diagnosis of TCM with SAH was made. Appropriate emergent care was provided, and at follow-up, she made a complete cardiologic recovery. TCM is a puzzling condition in an emergency setting and accurate and timely diagnosis is imperative in the management. Early prevention of hypoxemia and maintenance of mean arterial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure is critical in determining the long-term outcome of the patient in the setting of co-existing CNS pathologies.
