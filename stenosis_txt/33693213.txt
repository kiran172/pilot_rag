Title: Residual Gensini Score Is Associated With Long-Term Cardiac Mortality in Patients With Heart Failure After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.

Abstract: Background: Coronary revascularization is important in heart failure (HF) with ischemic etiology. Coronary scoring systems are useful to evaluate coronary artery disease, but said systems for residual stenosis after revascularization are still poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of the current study was to clarify the prognostic impact of residual stenosis using a coronary scoring system, Gensini score, in HF patients after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Methods and Results: We analyzed consecutive hospitalized ischemic HF patients (n=199) who underwent PCI. We calculated residual Gensini score after PCI, and divided the patients into 2 groups based on median residual Gensini score. The patients with high scores (≥10, n=101) had a higher prevalence of anemia, lower prevalence of dyslipidemia, and lower left ventricular ejection fraction, compared with those with low scores (&lt;10, n=98). During the median follow-up period of 1,581 days (range, 20-2,896 days), the high-score patients had a higher cardiac mortality than the low-score group (log rank, P=0.001). Conclusions: In patients with HF after PCI, residual Gensini score was associated with long-term cardiac mortality. Residual Gensini score may be a useful index for risk stratification of HF after PCI.
