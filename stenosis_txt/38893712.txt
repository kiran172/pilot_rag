Title: Endovascular Stenting for Idiopathic Stenosis of the Superior Mesenteric Vein: A Case Report.

Abstract: Idiopathic superior mesenteric vein (SMV) stenosis, where no clear causative factor is identifiable, remains a clinical rarity. We present a detailed case report of a patient with idiopathic stenosis of the SMV who underwent successful endovascular stenting. This report outlines the patient's clinical presentation, diagnostic imaging findings, procedural approach by the interventional radiology team, and subsequent management. Endovascular stenting is a viable therapeutic option for patients with idiopathic SMV stenosis. This case demonstrates that with appropriate interventional and post-procedural management, long-term stent patency and thrombosis prevention can be achieved. The success of this case encourages further investigation into endovascular treatments for venous stenoses.
