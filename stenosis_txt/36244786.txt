Title: A Technical Pitfall of Decompression with Direct Repair of a Ragged Edge Using the Smiley-Face Rod Method :  A Case Report.

Abstract: The smiley-face rod method has been reported to be a successful technique for reducing slippage and repairing pars defects in lumbar spondylolisthesis. However, we encountered a patient who developed right L5 radiculopathy with muscle weakness after use of the smiley-face rod method. The patient was a 19-year-old female judo player who had undergone direct repair surgery using the smiley-face rod method for terminal-stage lumbar spondylolysis. Postoperatively, she developed paresthesia on the lateral side of the right thigh with weakness of the right tibialis anterior and extensor hallucis longus. Computed tomography showed right foraminal stenosis at L5 with the floating lamina shifted ventrally and apophyseal ring fracture. In this case, the spondylolysis fracture angle differed between the left and right sides, with the fracture line on the right side running more sagittally. As a result, the floating lamina was shifted ventrally on the right side by compression and the right L5 intervertebral foraminal space was narrowed due to the ventral shift in the floating lamina and the apophyseal ring bone fragment. The shape of the fracture line should be examined carefully before surgery to avoid this technical pitfall. J. Med. Invest. 69 : 308-311, August, 2022.
