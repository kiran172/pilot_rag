Title: Prognosis and antiplatelet therapy of small single subcortical infarcts in penetrating artery territory: a post hoc analysis of the Third China National Stroke Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Small single subcortical infarction (SSSI) may be classified as parent artery disease-related or only branch involved according to the stenosis of parent artery. The study aimed to evaluate short-term and long-term prognoses and the effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy in SSSI.
METHODS: We prospectively enrolled 2890 patients with SSSI from the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III) database from August 2015 to March 2018. We assessed clinical outcomes and antiplatelet treatment effects in patients with SSSI with and without parent artery stenosis (PAS) identified by magnetic resonance angiography.
RESULTS: Among 2890 patients with SSSI in the perforator territory of the middle cerebral artery and the basilar artery, there were 680 (23.53%) patients with PAS and 2210 (76.47%) patients without PAS, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, the PAS group had a greater initial stroke severity (OR 1.262, 95% CI 1.058 to 1.505; p=0.0097) and a higher risk of ischaemic stroke recurrence at 3 months (OR 2.266, 95% CI 1.631 to 3.149; p<0.0001) and 1 year (OR 2.054, 95% CI 1.561 to 2.702; p<0.0001), as well as composite vascular events at 3 months (OR 2.306, 95% CI 1.674 to 3.178; p<0.0001) and 1 year (OR 1.983, 95% CI 1.530 to 2.570; p<0.0001), compared with the non-PAS group. In both groups, dual antiplatelet therapy was not superior to single antiplatelet therapy in preventing stroke recurrence, composite vascular events and disability.
CONCLUSION: PAS related to significantly higher rates of short-term and long-term stroke recurrence and composite vascular events, suggesting heterogeneous mechanisms in SSSI subgroups. The effectiveness of antiplatelet therapy for SSSI needs further investigation.
