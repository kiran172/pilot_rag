Title: Cohort study on the relationship between morphologic parameters of paravertebral muscles, BMI and lumbar lordosis on the severity of lumbar stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: There is a growing body of literature separately linking lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) with various factors such as paravertebral muscle (PVM) impaired function/morphology, lordosis or BMI. However, their interplay is yet to be known. The present study aims to investigate the relationship between PVM morphology, BMI and lumbar lordosis in a population with a surgical indication for LSS.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional retrospective study was conducted on a group of 122 patients diagnosed with LSS in a hospital setting and scheduled for spine surgery. Epidemiological data and body mass index (BMI) were gathered. The cross-sectional area of the psoas muscle (rCSA) at the L4-L5 disc level on preoperative axial T2 MRI was measured. Fat infiltration of the anterior (APVM) and posterior paravertebral muscles (PPVM) was evaluated according to Goutallier classification while the severity of lumbar stenosis was staged according to Schizas criteria. Lumbar lordosis was measured on sagittal MRI using Cobb's angle method. The presence of the "rising psoas" sign was also noted. Statistical analysis of the data was performed using Pearson and Spearman correlations.
RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed a moderate correlation between the severity of LSS and BMI (p = 0.001), and fatty infiltration of paravertebral muscles (p = 0.000, p = 0.000). Adjusting for age, gender, and BMI resulted in a low correlation (p = 0.003, p = 0.045), rCSA correlated negatively with age, gender, and lordosis. BMI had a low positive correlation with lumbar lordosis (p = 0.006), severity (p = 0.001), number of levels (p = 0.005) and PPVM (p = 0.031).
CONCLUSIONS: This study highlighted the relationship between PVM morphology and the severity of radiological signs in patients with LSS undergoing spine surgery and found a correlation independent of age, gender, and BMI. BMI was also shown to correlate with the severity after controlling for age and gender. rCSA has limited use in evaluating the severity of LSS.
