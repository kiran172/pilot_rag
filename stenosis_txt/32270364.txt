Title: Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenoses: Pathophysiology, Epidemiology, Risk Factors and Current Therapy Options.

Abstract: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenoses (ICAS) are one of the most common causes of first and recurrent cerebrovascular ischaemic events worldwide, with highest prevalence in Asian, Hispanic and African populations. Clinical trials have improved the understanding of epidemiology, risk factors and imaging characteristics of patients with ICAS. Current therapeutic approaches concerning these patients include management of risk factors, best medical therapy, potentially endovascular and rarely surgical therapy. In our review, we elucidate the current epidemiology and evidence in evaluation of risk factors and therapeutic options for providing favourable outcome for patients with ICAS.
