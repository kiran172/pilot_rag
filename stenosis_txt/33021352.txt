Title: Aneurysm of the aortic root and valve‑sparing aortic root replacement: long-term outcomes from a single Polish center.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement (VSARR) techniques are an alternative to the classic Bentall procedure when aortic root aneurysm is not accompanied by aortic valve stenosis, and the regurgitant aortic valve is amenable to repair.
AIMS: The aim of the study was to assess long -term outcomes of valve sparing aortic root replacement using the David technique and the Yacoub technique.
METHODS: A total of 101 consecutive, elective VSARR procedures were performed from January 2010 to April 2020 including 52 David procedures (51.5%) and 49 Yacoub procedures (48.5%). We analyzed mortality, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from aortic valve regurgitation. The analysis was performed for the entire study cohort and for 2 subgroups: the David technique and the Yacoub technique.
RESULTS: The mean (SD) age was 50.2 (16.1) years; 90 (89.1%) patients were male. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) EuroScore II was 3.7 (2.7‒5.8). At 1, 5, and 8 years after surgery, survival (SE) was 98% (3%), 91.8% (8%), and 91.8% (8%), respectively, whereas freedom from reoperation (SE) was 100%, 97% (3%), and 97% (3%), respectively. Follow‑up echocardiography performed at a median (IQR) of 18.7 (2.5‒36.7) months postsurgery revealed freedom from aortic valve regurgitation in 90.8% of patients. No significant differences in mortality, freedom from reoperation, and freedom from aortic valve regurgitation were noted between the David and Yacoub subgroups.
CONCLUSIONS: VSARR is a safe and effective surgical technique in patients with aortic root aneurysm, as the associated mortality, reoperation rate, and aortic valve regurgitation recurrence are low.
