Title: Transfemoral aortic valve implantation in a patient with mediastinal displacement following pneumonectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac interventions following pneumonectomy have rarely been described in the scientific literature. With the increase of availability of treatment options for previously inoperable patients, there might arise a need for the development of therapeutic strategies for these patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: An 85-year-old man presented to our facility with a symptomatic aortic stenosis, a coronary artery disease in need of intervention and a history of prior left sided pneumonectomy. We performed an uneventful coronary artery stenting and subsequent transfemoral aortic valve implantation.
CONCLUSION: Surgical experience with cardiac interventions following pneumonectomy is limited but suggests a high rate of postoperative complications and mortality. An interventional approach is viable, however meticulous planning and consideration of the imaging modalities is essential.
