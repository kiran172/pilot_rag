Title: Transcatheter Interventions in Patients With Adult Congenital Heart Disease.

Abstract: Patients with congenital heart disease now live well into adulthood because of advances in surgical techniques, improvements in medical management, and the development of novel therapeutic agents. As patients grow older into adults with congenital heart disease, many require catheter-based interventions for the treatment of residual defects, sequelae of their initial repair or palliation, or acquired heart disease. The past 3 decades have witnessed an exponential growth in both the type and number of transcatheter interventions in patients with congenital heart disease. With improvements in medical technology and device design, including the use of devices designed for the treatment of acquired valve stenosis or regurgitation, patients who previously would have required open-heart surgery for various conditions can now undergo percutaneous cardiac catheter-based procedures. Many of these procedures are complex and occur in complex patients who are best served by a multidisciplinary team. This review aims to highlight some of the currently available transcatheter interventional procedures for adults with congenital heart disease, the clinical outcomes of each intervention, and any special considerations so that the reader may better understand both the procedure and patients with adult congenital heart disease.
