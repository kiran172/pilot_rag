Title: Predicting pressure gradient using artificial intelligence for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: After transcatheter aortic valve replacement, the mean transvalvular pressure gradient indicates the effectiveness of the therapy. The objective is to develop artificial intelligence to predict the post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement aortic valve pressure gradient and aortic valve area from preprocedural echocardiography and computed tomography data.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement due to aortic valve stenosis. A total of 1091 patients were analyzed for pressure gradient predictions (mean age 76.8 ± 9.2 years, 57.8% male), and 1063 patients were analyzed for aortic valve area predictions (mean age 76.7 ± 9.3 years, 57.2% male). An artificial intelligence learning model was trained (training: n = 663 patients, validation: n = 206 patients) and tested (testing: n = 222 patients) to predict pressure gradient, and a separate artificial intelligence learning model was trained (training: n = 640 patients, validation: n = 218 patients) and tested (testing: n = 205 patients) for predicting aortic valve area.
RESULTS: The mean absolute error for pressure gradient and aortic valve area predictions was 3.0 mm Hg and 0.45 cm2, respectively. Valve sheath size, body surface area, and age were determined to be the top 3 predictors for pressure gradient, and valve sheath size, left ventricular ejection fraction, and aortic annulus mean diameter were identified to be the top 3 predictors of post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement aortic valve area. A training dataset size of more than 500 patients demonstrated good robustness of the artificial intelligence models for pressure gradient and aortic valve area.
CONCLUSIONS: The artificial intelligence-based algorithm has demonstrated potential in predicting post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement transvalvular pressure gradient predictions for patients with aortic valve stenosis. Further studies are necessary to differentiate pressure gradient between valve types.
