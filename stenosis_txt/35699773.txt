Title: Multiple hypointense veins on susceptibility weighted imaging as a promising biomarker of impaired cerebral hemodynamics in chronic steno-occlusive disease: a multiparametric MRI study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Patients with steno-occlusive arterial disease may develop cerebral hypoperfusion with possible neurologic sequelae. The aim of the study is to verify the possible role of SWI, as a marker of cerebral hypoperfusion, in the identification of patient subgroups with significant chronic occlusions/stenoses at risk of critical cerebral hypoperfusion.
METHODS: We retrospectively identified 37 asymptomatic patients with chronic intra-extracranial occlusion/stenosis of the anterior circulation from a prospective brain MRI register between 2016 and 2020. All patients underwent 3 Tesla MRI. The imaging protocol included the following: SWI, 3D-FLAIR, DWI sequences, and 3D-TOF MRA. SWI findings were graded for the presence of asymmetric intracranial cortical veins (grades 1 to 4). The presence of collateralization was assessed with concomitant multiphase-CTA. FLAIR was evaluated for the presence of distal hyperintense vessels (DHVs), a described marker of flow impairment, and possible collateralization. Cerebral blood flow and arterial transit artifacts (ATAs) were evaluated at pCASL in 29 patients.
RESULTS: SWI showed multiple hypointense vessels (MHVs) in 22/37 patients in the cerebral hemisphere ipsilateral to vessel occlusion/stenosis. SWI-MHV grade 1 was found in 15 patients (40.5%), grade 2 in 18 patients (48.7%), and grade 3 in 3 patients (8.1%); in one patient, SWI was graded as 4 (2.7%). A significant relationship was found among MHV, DHV, collaterals, ATAs, and hypoperfused areas on pCASL and with patients' previous neurological symptoms.
CONCLUSION: SWI-MVH correlates with chronic cerebral flow impairment and is related to hypoperfusion and collateralization. It may help identify a subgroup of patients benefitting from revascularization.
