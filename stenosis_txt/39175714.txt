Title: The application of real-time indocyanine green fluorescence cholangiography in laparoscopic living donor left lateral sectionectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The judgment of the division point of the bile duct has always been one of the difficulties of laparoscopic left lateral sectionectomy (LLLS). The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence cholangiography during LLLS on the occurrence of biliary complications in both donors and recipients. The optimal dose and injection time of ICG were also investigated.
METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study. From October 2016 to December 2022, the clinical data of 103 donors who underwent LLLS and relevant recipients were retrospectively analyzed. According to whether ICG fluorescence cholangiography was used, they were divided into a non-ICG group (n=46) and an ICG group (n=57). Biliary complications were observed and the optimal dose and injection time of ICG were explored.
RESULTS: Three donors in the non-ICG group suffered from bile leakage. Four grafts had multiple bile duct openings and biliary complications were observed in the relevant recipients who received these grafts in the non-ICG group. Two recipients had bile leakage, and the other two had biliary stenosis. There was no biliary complications both in donors and recipients in the ICG group. The fluorescence intensity of the liver was 108.1±17.6 at a dose of 0.004 mg/kg 90 minutes after injection, significantly weaker than that at 0.05 mg/kg 30 minutes (200.3±17.6, P=0.001) and 90 minutes after injection (140.2±15.4, P=0.001). The fluorescence intensity contrast value at a dose of 0.004 mg/kg was stronger than that at 0.05 mg/kg, both measured 90 minutes after injection (0.098±0.032 vs. 0.078±0.022, P=0.021).
CONCLUSIONS: ICG fluorescence cholangiography is safe and feasible in LLLS. It reduces biliary complications in both donors and recipients. The optimal ICG dose was 0.004 mg/kg, and 90 minutes after injection was the best observation time. ICG fluorescence cholangiography is recommended for routine use in LLLS.
