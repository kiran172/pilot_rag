Title: Results of drug-eluting stent in significant restenosis of the hemodialysis access: An initial study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to report the 12-month results of drug-eluting stent (DES) for the treatment of significant restenosis of the hemodialysis access.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 14 patients (seven men and seven women; median age 70 years; range of 50-83 years) with significant restenosis of hemodialysis accesses were enrolled from January 2017 to December 2018. A total of 10 arteriovenous graft (AVG) and four arteriovenous fistulae were treated with DES. Study outcomes included primary patency of the target lesion and circuit.
RESULTS: Venous anastomosis of the AVG was the most common target lesion for DES insertion (nine hemodialysis accesses). The range of follow-up time was 12-36 months. Primary patency rates of target lesion before DES (patency for last conventional balloon angioplasty [CBA]) versus target lesion after DES at 6 and 12 months were 29% versus 100% and 7% versus 86% (p < 0.001). Primary patency rates of pre-DES circuit (patency for last CBA) versus post-DES circuit at 6 and 12 months were 29% versus 64% and 7% versus 29%, respectively (p = 0.058).
CONCLUSION: DES might improve the patency rate of target lesion in patients with significant restenosis of the hemodialysis access.
