Title: Chronic Ischemic Gastritis in a Patient With a History of Cancer and Atherosclerotic Disease.

Abstract: Chronic mesenteric ischemia is an uncommon disease presenting with nonspecific symptoms. The large number of differential diagnoses may result in diagnostic delays and progression to acute mesenteric ischemia. A 74-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and carotid atherosclerosis complained of postprandial abdominal pain, vomiting, and weight loss. Endoscopic examination showed active chronic gastritis Helicobacter pylori negative. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed stenosis in the mesenteric arterial district. Chronic gastritis resistant to treatment in a patient complaining of postprandial abdominal pain and weight loss should be investigated for chronic mesenteric ischemia, although history of cancer could be a misleading factor.
