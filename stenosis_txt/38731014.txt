Title: Non-Invasive Tools in Perioperative Stroke Risk Assessment for Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis with a Focus on the Circle of Willis.

Abstract: This review aims to explore advancements in perioperative ischemic stroke risk estimation for asymptomatic patients with significant carotid artery stenosis, focusing on Circle of Willis (CoW) morphology based on the CTA or MR diagnostic imaging in the current preoperative diagnostic algorithm. Functional transcranial Doppler (fTCD), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) are discussed in the context of evaluating cerebrovascular reserve capacity and collateral vascular systems, particularly the CoW. These non-invasive diagnostic tools provide additional valuable insights into the cerebral perfusion status. They support biomedical modeling as the gold standard for the prediction of the potential impact of carotid artery stenosis on the hemodynamic changes of cerebral perfusion. Intraoperative risk assessment strategies, including selective shunting, are explored with a focus on CoW variations and their implications for perioperative ischemic stroke and cognitive function decline. By synthesizing these insights, this review underscores the potential of non-invasive diagnostic methods to support clinical decision making and improve asymptomatic patient outcomes by reducing the risk of perioperative ischemic neurological events and preventing further cognitive decline.
