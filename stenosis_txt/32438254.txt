Title: Pediatric emergency gastrointestinal ultrasonography: pearls & pitfalls.

Abstract: Ultrasonography is an essential tool in pediatric imaging, particularly in the emergency setting. Although ultrasound is often the favored initial modality for abdominal imaging in children, it is highly operator-dependent and therefore prone to misinterpretation which can lead to false positive or negative exams, or even incorrect diagnoses. Conditions discussed in this series include ileocolic intussusception, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, appendicitis, and ingested foreign bodies. We will review diagnostic criteria, highlight crucial findings, and illustrate commonly-encountered difficulties and mimics.
