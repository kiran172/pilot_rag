Title: Concomitant carotid endarterectomy and aortic valve replacement in a patient with high risk of perioperative stroke.

Abstract: Surgical strategy for significant carotid artery stenosis complicated with severe aortic valve stenosis is still controversial. Herein, we report a case of 80-year-old female in whom 78% stenosis by the NASCET criteria in left internal carotid artery was pointed out during preoperative checkup for symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Carotid endarterectomy was done concomitantly with aortic valve replacement. No neurological complication occurred perioperatively.
