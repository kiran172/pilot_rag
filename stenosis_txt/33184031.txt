Title: Selective changes in cytosolic β-adrenergic cAMP signals and L-type Calcium Channel regulation by Phosphodiesterases during cardiac hypertrophy.

Abstract: Background In cardiomyocytes, phosphodiesterases (PDEs) type 3 and 4 are the predominant enzymes that degrade cAMP generated by β-adrenergic receptors (β-ARs), impacting notably the regulation of the L-type Ca2+ current (I<sub>Ca,L</sub>). Cardiac hypertrophy (CH) is accompanied by a reduction in PDE3 and PDE4, however, whether this affects the dynamic regulation of cytosolic cAMP and I<sub>Ca,L</sub> is not known. Methods and Results CH was induced in rats by thoracic aortic banding over a time period of five weeks and was confirmed by anatomical measurements. Left ventricular myocytes (LVMs) were isolated from CH and sham-operated (SHAM) rats and transduced with an adenovirus encoding a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based cAMP biosensor or subjected to the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique to measure I<sub>Ca,L</sub>. Aortic stenosis resulted in a 46% increase in heart weight to body weight ratio in CH compared to SHAM. In SHAM and CH LVMs, a short isoprenaline stimulation (Iso, 100 nM, 15 s) elicited a similar transient increase in cAMP with a half decay time (t<sub>1/2off</sub>) of ~50 s. In both groups, PDE4 inhibition with Ro 20-1724 (10 μM) markedly potentiated the amplitude and slowed the decline of the cAMP transient, this latter effect being more pronounced in SHAM (t<sub>1/2off</sub> ~ 250 s) than in CH (t<sub>1/2off</sub> ~ 150 s, P &lt; 0.01). In contrast, PDE3 inhibition with cilostamide (1 μM) had no effect on the amplitude of the cAMP transient and a minimal effect on its recovery in SHAM, whereas it potentiated the amplitude and slowed the decay in CH (t<sub>1/2off</sub> ~ 80 s). Iso pulse stimulation also elicited a similar transient increase in I<sub>Ca,L</sub> in SHAM and CH, although the duration of the rising phase was delayed in CH. Inhibition of PDE3 or PDE4 potentiated I<sub>Ca,L</sub> amplitude in SHAM but not in CH. Besides, while only PDE4 inhibition slowed down the decline of I<sub>Ca,L</sub> in SHAM, both PDE3 and PDE4 contributed in CH. Conclusion These results identify selective alterations in cytosolic cAMP and I<sub>Ca,L</sub> regulation by PDE3 and PDE4 in CH, and show that the balance between PDE3 and PDE4 for the regulation of β-AR responses is shifted toward PDE3 during CH.
