Title: Outcome of Operative Management of Lumbar Spinal Canal Stenosis at Mymensingh Medical College & Hospital.

Abstract: Variety of conditions may be responsible for low back pain but lumber spinal canal stenosis is an important cause of low back pain. Lumber spinal canal stenosis usually presents with low backache with neurogenic claudication and shortness of walking distance in adult patient. Surgical management of lumbar spinal canal stenosis by decompression surgery is effective method. This prospective interventional study was performed in patient with clinical features like low back pain with radicular pain, neurogenic claudication, signs of root compression, positive MRI findings attending in department of Orthopaedic Surgery Mymensingh Medical College Hospital and Private Hospital from July 2016 to June 2019. Thirty patients were evaluated among those 20(66.6%) were 50 years and above. The mean age was 47.5±1.6 years. Male to female ratio was roughly 8:1. Almost all of the patients had low backache with radiation to the back of the thigh and leg with motor weakness (60%). About 66.6% of the patients had sensory deficit and 83.3% had neurogenic claudication. Majority (80.0%) of the patients at presentation had a suffering of 12 or >12 months. The mean duration of suffering was 14.7±5.1 months. About 55% of the patients were able to perform heel-walking and 36.0% tip-toe walking. Nearly 57% of the patients had sensory deficit along the distribution of 1st sacral nerve and 53.3% along the distribution of lumber 5 nerves. Diagnosis shows that 16.6% of patients had L4 lesion, 50% L5, 10.0% patients had L4 & L5 and 46.6% S1. Laminectomy was done in 26.6% of patients, laminectomy and disectomy in 33.3% and laminectomy, discectomy & foraminal decompression in 40.0% of patients. Twenty five (83.5%) of patients was free from symptoms. Eighty percent (80.0%) of patients shows minimal disability and 20.0% moderate disability on the basis of Oswestry Disability Index, while by MacNab criteria, most (80%) of patients was excellent, 10% good and another 10% fair. Repeated measure ANOVA statistics showed that mean Oswestry score decreased significantly from 54.5% at baseline to 22% at the end of 1 year (p<0.001).
