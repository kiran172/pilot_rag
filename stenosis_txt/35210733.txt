Title: Management of Central Venous Stenosis and Occlusion in Dialysis Patients.

Abstract: Central venous occlusions (CVOs) of the major intrathoracic veins (jugular, subclavian, brachiocephalic, superior vena cava) can cause debilitating symptoms, negatively impact arteriovenous fistula/graft function, or limit potential access creation options in end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) utilizing hemodialysis (HD). This review summarizes the incidence, pathophysiology, indications/contraindications, and management options of CVOs in the ESKD on HD population and concludes with considerations and examples when planning endovascular central recanalization procedures, which have risen as the first-line management when appropriate.
