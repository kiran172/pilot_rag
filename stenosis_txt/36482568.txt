Title: Gastrointestinal bleeding during the transcatheter aortic valve replacement perioperative period: A Review.

Abstract: With the aging of the population, the incidence of senile degenerative valvular heart disease is expected to increase. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been used for patients at lower surgical risk with symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. Because of the improvements in TAVR technology and increasing experience of the operators, TAVR is regarded as a safe and feasible procedure. Bleeding events during the TAVR perioperative period, especially gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, have been proven to be related to the long-term prognosis and mortality. Elderly patients with valvular heart disease are susceptible to GI bleeding because of their use of antithrombotic drugs, physical damage of coagulation factors, and GI angiodysplasia. Frequent GI bleeding and low levels of preoperative hemoglobin increase the risk of TAVR, especially for elderly patients. Because of these risks, which are easily overlooked, we should focus more attention on the perioperative management of TAVR. Reasonable screening tools, including blood examinations, risk evaluation scales, and endoscopy, are beneficial to the prevention of complications that can occur during the perioperative period. Additionally, medical therapy can safely help patients at high-risk for bleeding patients throughout the perioperative period. This study aimed to characterize the pathology of TAVR patients and discuss treatment strategies for GI bleeding during the perioperative period.
