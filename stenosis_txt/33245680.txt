Title: Imaging Changes and Clinical Complications After Drug-Eluting Bead Versus Conventional Transarterial Chemoembolization for Unresectable Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Multicenter Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND. Drug-eluting bead transarterial chemoembolization (DEB-TACE) has emerged as an alternative to conventional TACE (cTACE) for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), although selection between the approaches remains controversial. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to compare DEB-TACE and cTACE in the treatment of patients with unresectable HCC in terms of hepatobiliary changes on imaging and clinical complications. METHODS. This retrospective study included 1002 patients (871 men, 131 women; mean age, 59 ± 12 years) from three centers who had previously untreated unresectable HCC and underwent DEB-TACE with epirubicin (780 procedures in 394 patients) or cTACE with ethiodized oil mixed with doxorubicin and oxaliplatin (1187 procedures in 608 patients) between May 2016 and November 2018. Among these patients 83.4% had hepatitis B-related liver disease, 57.6% had Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage A or B HCC, and 42.4% had three or more nodules. Mean tumor size was 6.3 ± 4.2 cm. Hepatobiliary changes and tumor response were evaluated with CT or MRI 1 month after TACE. Clinical records were reviewed for adverse events. RESULTS. Bile duct dilatation (p &lt; .001) and portal vein narrowing (p = .006) on imaging and liver failure (p = .03) and grade 3 abdominal pain (p &lt; .001) in clinical follow-up occurred at higher frequency in the DEB-TACE group (15.5%, 4.6%, 2.3%, and 6.1%) than in the cTACE (7.4%, 1.6%, 0.7%, and 2.1%) group. Higher frequency of bile duct dilation in patients who underwent DEB-TACE was observed in subgroup analyses that included patients with BCLC stage A or B HCC (p = .001), with cirrhosis (p &lt; .001), without cirrhosis (p = .04), and without main portal vein tumor thrombus (p = .002). Total bilirubin level 1 month after treatment was 1.5 ± 2.4 mg/dL (95% CI, 1.2-1.8 mg/dL) for DEB-TACE versus 1.3 ± 2.0 mg/dL (95% CI, 1.1-1.5 mg/dL) for cTACE (p = .02). The cTACE and DEB-TACE groups did not differ in other manifestations of postembolization syndrome or systemic toxicity (p &gt; .05). Local tumor disease control rates did not differ between the cTACE and DEB-TACE groups (1 month, 96.7% vs 98.5%, p = .06; 3 months, 81.8% vs 82.4%, p = .87), but overall DCR was significantly higher in the cTACE than in the DEB-TACE group (1 month, 87.5% vs 80.0%, p = .001; 3 months, 78.5% vs 72.1%, p = .02). CONCLUSION. Compared with cTACE, DEB-TACE was associated with greater frequency of hepatobiliary injury and severe abdominal pain. CLINICAL IMPACT. Greater caution and closer follow-up are warranted for patients who undergo DEB-TACE for unresectable HCC than for those who undergo cTACE.
