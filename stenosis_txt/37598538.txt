Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With and Without Index Chronic Total Occlusion of Coronary Artery: A Propensity Matched Analysis.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) utilization is increasing, along with procedural success. Coronary angiography is frequently performed before the TAVR procedure for coronary artery disease workup. Chronic total occlusion (CTO) of the coronary artery shares common risk factors with aortic stenosis and could be challenging, especially in terms of procedural safety. The outcomes of TAVR among patients with concomitant CTO are not extensively studied. We analyzed the National Inpatient Sample database between October 2015 and December 2020 to evaluate the clinical characteristics, procedural safety, and outcomes among patients who underwent TAVR who had concomitant CTO lesions. A total of 304,330 TAVRs were performed between 2015 and 2020, 5,235 of which (1.72%) were in patients with TAVR-CTO and 299,095 (98.28%) in those with TAVR-no CTO. After propensity matching, there was no difference in the odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.94 to 1.75, p = 0.11). However, TAVR-CTO was associated with an increased incidence of acute myocardial infarction (aOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.53, p = 0.01), cardiac arrest (aOR, 2.60, 95% CI 1.64 to 4.11, p <0.0001), and need for mechanical circulatory support (aOR 2.6, 95% CI 1.88 to 3.59, p <0.0001). There was no difference in the incidence of stroke, major bleeding, complete heart block, or requirement for permanent pacemaker between the 2 groups. However, the TAVR-CTO cohort had a slightly greater length of stay and total hospitalization cost. TAVR is a relatively safe procedure among those with concomitant CTO lesions; however, it is associated with a greater incidence of acute myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, and requirement for mechanical circulatory support.
