Title: A Spontaneous Extracranial Internal Carotid Artery Dissection with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Non-cystic manifestation of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an important risk factor for cerebral aneurysms. In this report, we describe a rare spontaneous internal carotid artery (ICA) dissection in a patient with ADPKD. Observations: A 38-year-old woman with a history of ADPKD and acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery dissection experienced severe spontaneous pain on the left side of her neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a severe left ICA stenosis localized at its origin. Carotid plaque MRI showed that the stenotic lesion was due to a subacute intramural hematoma. Close follow-up by an imaging study was performed under the diagnosis of spontaneous extracranial ICA dissection, and spontaneous regression of the intramural hematoma was observed uneventfully. Conclusions: When patients with a history of ADPKD present with severe neck pain, it is crucial to consider the possibility of a spontaneous ICA dissection. A carotid plaque MRI is beneficial in the differential diagnosis. Conservative management may benefit patients without ischemic symptoms.
