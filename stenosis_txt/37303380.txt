Title: Limb Salvage Using Polytetrafluoroethylene Prosthetic Bypass in Femoral Atherosclerosis: A Case Report and Review of Literature.

Abstract: The choice of a vascular graft in patients with femoral atherosclerosis has always been a matter of debate. But when a deep review of the literature is done, the autogenous graft using the saphenous vein is considered the most reliable graft material for the vessels involved below the level of the inguinal ligament. In recent years, there have been published studies comparing vascular versus prosthetic grafts. We report a case covering a similar domain where femoropopliteal bypass was done using a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) prosthetic graft and the outcome after the surgical procedure.
