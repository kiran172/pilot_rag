Title: Intracranial Angioplasty via Type II Proatlantal Intersegmental Artery.

Abstract: A proatlantal intersegmental artery (PIA) is an exceedingly rare primitive anastomosis between the carotid and vertebrobasilar circulations. PIAs may be accompanied by ipsilateral or bilateral vertebral artery (VA) agenesis and can originate from the cervical internal carotid artery (ICA, type I) or external carotid artery (ECA, type II) before eventually joining the vertebrobasilar system. Several authors have described this anomaly in different clinical scenarios, but to our knowledge, there are no studies documenting VA angioplasty through a type II PIA in the setting of vertebrobasilar stroke. We present the case of vertebrobasilar stroke in which the right VA did not originate from the right subclavian artery but instead from the ECA. The patient was subsequently determined to have a type II PIA. We performed right VA angioplasty via the PIA, followed by partial restoration of vertebrobasilar blood flow. This is the first documented case of intracranial vertebral angioplasty through a type II PIA and serves as a reminder for neuroendovascular surgeons about persistent fetal circulation. In such instances, an angiogram of both the ICA and ECA should be performed to exclude right VA stenosis and visualize persistent fetal circulation. This case underscores the complexity of arterial thrombotic events, the beneficial role of endovascular intervention, and the necessity of future studies to identify the optimal treatment methods for vertebrobasilar stroke.
