Title: Radiomics to Detect Inflammation and Fibrosis on Magnetic Resonance Enterography in Stricturing Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-invasive cross-sectional imaging via magnetic resonance enterography [MRE] offers excellent accuracy for the diagnosis of stricturing complications in Crohn's disease [CD] but is limited in determining the degrees of fibrosis and inflammation within a stricture. We developed and validated a radiomics-based machine-learning model for separately characterizing the degree of histopathological inflammation and fibrosis in CD strictures and compared it to centrally read visual radiologist scoring of MRE.
METHODS: This single-centre, cross-sectional study included 51 CD patients [n = 34 for discovery; n = 17 for validation] with terminal ileal strictures confirmed on diagnostic MRE within 15 weeks of resection. Histopathological specimens were scored for inflammation and fibrosis and spatially linked with corresponding pre-surgical MRE sequences. Annotated stricture regions on MRE were scored visually by radiologists as well as underwent 3D radiomics-based machine learning analysis; both were evaluated against histopathology.
RESULTS: Two distinct sets of radiomic features capturing textural heterogeneity within strictures were linked with each of severe inflammation or severe fibrosis across both the discovery (area under the curve [AUC = 0.69, 0.83] and validation [AUC = 0.67, 0.78] cohorts. Radiologist visual scoring had an AUC = 0.67 for identifying severe inflammation and AUC = 0.35 for severe fibrosis. Use of combined radiomics and radiologist scoring robustly augmented identification of severe inflammation [AUC = 0.79] and modestly improved assessment of severe fibrosis [AUC = 0.79 for severe fibrosis] over individual approaches.
CONCLUSIONS: Radiomic features of CD strictures on MRE can accurately identify severe histopathological inflammation and severe histopathological fibrosis, as well as augment performance of the radiologist visual scoring in stricture characterization.
