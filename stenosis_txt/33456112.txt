Title: Localization and shape of stenoses in central lung carcinoma - Sensitivity and precision of MDCT VB and FB.

Abstract: The objective is to present diagnostic capabilities of virtual bronchoscopy (VB) and fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FB) for determining the localization and shape of stenoses in patients with central lung carcinoma. A systematic study was performed on 220 patients aged 11-83 (54.36Â±17.24) years with endobronchial disease using the FB and VB methods during the 2013-2017 period. Central carcinoma of the lung was found on VB in 130 patients and on FB in 120 patients. Other nosologic diseases were found in 22 patients. Right localization of central carcinoma prevailed over left localization in both sexes. A significant difference in the localization criterion was found in female patients examined by VB (U-test, p=0.01). VB and FB yielded 86.5% vs. 91.60% precision and 85% vs. 94.5% sensitivity. In conclusion, VB was found to be a successful noninvasive method for determining the localization of lung tumors and shape of stenoses, which are essential in the diagnosis of malignant processes.
