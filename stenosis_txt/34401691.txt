Title: Long-term Follow-up After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become the standard of care in the majority of patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis. Data on long-term mortality and durability of transcatheter heart valves (THVs) beyond 5 years are limited. Our study aimed to assess elderly and high-risk patients' long-term outcomes treated with TAVR in a prospective single-centre registry focusing on the durability of THVs.
METHODS: We included 795 patients with severe calcific aortic stenosis treated by transfemoral TAVR between 2006 and 2011. Echocardiography was performed at baseline; discharge; 1 year; and afterward, annually, until the longest available follow-up. Mortality rates were estimated for 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 years. The rates of structural valve deterioration (SVD) and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) were assessed in accordance with consensus definitions. Outcome measures were adjudicated according to Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2).
RESULTS: Median (interquartile range) follow-up time was 1345 (316; 2015) days. One-year, 5-year, 6-year, 7-year, and 8-year overall mortality was 25.4%, 59.0%, 64.6%, 67.9%, and 69.2%, respectively. At 8 years, no significant differences in mortality were found comparing self-expanding vs balloon-expandable valves (69.5% vs 68.0%, P = 0.709) and postdilatation (PD) vs no-PD (69.4% vs 69.2%, P = 0.363). SVD was detected in 26 patients (3.3%), and 19 (2.4%) of the 795 patients had evidence of BVF during follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrates good long-term results for high-risk patients who were alive up to 8 years after TAVR.
