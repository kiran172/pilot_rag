Title: Regional Myocardial Work Measured by Echocardiography for the Detection of Myocardial Ischemic Segments: A Comparative Study With Invasive Fractional Flow Reserve.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study is to assess the diagnostic value of noninvasive regional myocardial work (MW) by echocardiography for detecting the functional status of coronary stenosis using fractional flow reserve (FFR) as a standard criterion.
METHODS: A total of 84 consecutive patients were included in this study, among which 92 vessels were identified with ≥50% stenosis confirmed by invasive coronary angiography. Patients were investigated by invasive FFR and transthoracic echocardiography. Regional MW indices including myocardial work index (MWI), myocardial constructive work (MCW), myocardial wasted work, and myocardial work efficiency were calculated.
RESULTS: MWI and MCW were significantly impaired in the FFR ≤ 0.75 group compared with the FFR &gt; 0.75 group (both p &lt; 0.01). There were significant positive associations between MWI and MCW with FFR. In total group, MWI &lt;1,623.7 mmHg% [sensitivity, 78.4%; specificity, 72.2%; area under the curve value, 0.768 (0.653-0.883)] and MCW &lt;1,962.4 mmHg% [77.0%; 72.2%; 0.767 (0.661-0.872)], and in single-vessel subgroup, MWI &lt;1,412.1 mmHg% [93.5%; 63.6%; 0.808 (0.652-0.965)] and MCW &lt;1,943.3 mmHg% [(84.8%; 72.7%; 0.800 (0.657-0.943)] were optimal to detect left ventricular segments with an FFR ≤ 0.75. MWI and MCW significantly increased after percutaneous coronary intervention in 13 cases.
CONCLUSION: In patients with coronary artery disease, especially those with single-vessel stenosis, the regional MW measured by echocardiography exhibited a good diagnostic value in detecting significant myocardial ischemia compared to the standard FFR approach.
