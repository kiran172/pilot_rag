Title: Towards a 'step-up approach' for the treatment of recurrent non-stenotic cholangitis after hepaticojejunostomy: systematic review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recurrent non-stenotic cholangitis (NSC) is a difficult-to-treat complication after hepaticojejunostomy (HJ) leading to multiple hospital admissions. The optimal treatment strategy is unclear as a systematic review is lacking.
METHODS: A systematic review was performed including studies detailing treatment strategies and outcomes for recurrent NSC in patients with a surgical HJ in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library (inception - September 2023). Primary outcome was resolution of NSC as defined by the included studies.
RESULTS: Overall, 72 patients with recurrent NSC after HJ were included from seven retrospective studies. The rate of recurrent NSC (specified in five studies) was 4% (46/1143 HJs). Diagnosis of NSC was mostly made after excluding HJ stenosis and assessing bile reflux. Initial treatment consisted of short-course antibiotics for all patients. Second step treatment consisted of prolonged antibiotic therapy (n = 10, 13.8%). Third step treatment consisted of surgery (n = 9, n = 12.5%); mostly lengthening of the biliary loop. Together, the overall reported resolution-rate of recurrent NSC was 66.6% (n = 48).
CONCLUSION: A 'step-up approach' may be effective in two-thirds of patients with recurrent NSC after HJ, starting with short-course antibiotics, and eventually adding prolonged antibiotic therapy and, ultimately, surgery aimed at preventing intestinal content and food reflux. Prospective studies are needed.
