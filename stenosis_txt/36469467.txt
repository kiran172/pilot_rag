Title: [Tracheobronchial stenting in patients with non-resectable tumors complicated by airway stenosis].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the results and efficiency of tracheobronchial stenting in patients with unresectable tumors complicated by stenosis of central airways.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analyzed the results of tracheobronchial stenting in 23 patients with unresectable tumors complicated by stenosis of central airways between 2016 and 2021.
RESULTS: Technical and clinical success rate was 100%. No intraoperative complications were noted. Dyspnea regressed in all patients in early postoperative period. Moreover, there was objective improvement in lung ventilation with increase in lung capacity (from 2.1±0.4 to 2.7±0.5 l; p&lt;0.05), forced expiratory volume (from 1.2±0.5 to 1.8±0.4 l; p&lt;0.05), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (from 47±7.4 to 85±6.3 mm Hg; p&lt;0.05) and arterial oxygen saturation (from 86.1±8.2 to 93.1±5.1%; p&lt;0.05). One patient developed massive bleeding due to tumor decay on the 3rd day after surgery. In 2 patients, stent obturation with a «mucus plug» was observed after 2-3 postoperative days. In 3 months after surgery, 21.8% of patients had disturbances of external respiration accompanied by mild dyspnea due to granulation tissue growth. Stent migration in 3 months after endoscopic stenting was recorded in 1 patient. Three-month mortality was 26.1%.
CONCLUSION: Tracheobronchial stenting is a safe and effective minimally invasive surgical intervention. As a part of palliative care, this procedure improves functional and clinical parameters of pulmonary ventilation and reduces the incidence of complications. Thus, quality of life in patients with unresectable tumors complicated by airway stenosis is improved.
