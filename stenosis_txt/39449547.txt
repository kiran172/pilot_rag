Title: Reproducibility of Cardiac Multifrequency MR Elastography in Assessing Left Ventricular Stiffness and Viscosity.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) shows promise in assessing the mechanofunctional properties of the heart but faces clinical challenges, mainly synchronization with cardiac cycle, breathing, and external harmonic stimulation.
PURPOSE: To determine the reproducibility of in vivo cardiac multifrequency MRE (MMRE) for assessing diastolic left ventricular (LV) stiffness and viscosity.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
SUBJECTS: This single-center study included a total of 28 participants (mean age, 56.6 ± 23.0 years; 16 male) consisting of randomly selected healthy participants (mean age, 44.6 ± 20.1 years; 9 male) and patients with aortic stenosis (mean age, 78.3 ± 3.8 years; 7 male).
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T, 3D multifrequency MRE with a single-shot spin-echo planar imaging sequence.
ASSESSMENT: Each participant underwent two cardiac MMRE examinations on the same day. Full 3D wave fields were acquired in diastole at frequencies of 80, 90, and 100 Hz during a total of three breath-holds. Shear wave speed (SWS) and penetration rate (PR) were reconstructed as a surrogate for tissue stiffness and inverse viscous loss. Epicardial and endocardial ROIs were manually drawn by two independent readers to segment the LV myocardium.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Shapiro-Wilk test, Bland-Altman analysis and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). P-value <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Bland-Altman analyses and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC = 0.96 for myocardial stiffness and ICC = 0.93 for viscosity) indicated near-perfect test-retest repeatability among examinations on the same day. The mean SWS for scan and re-scan diastolic LV myocardium were 2.42 ± 0.24 m/s and 2.39 ± 0.23 m/s; the mean PR were 1.24 ± 0.17 m/s and 1.22 ± 0.14 m/s. Inter-reader variability showed good to excellent agreement for myocardial stiffness (ICC = 0.92) and viscosity (ICC = 0.85).
DATA CONCLUSION: Cardiac MMRE is a promising and reproducible method for noninvasive assessment of diastolic LV stiffness and viscosity.
