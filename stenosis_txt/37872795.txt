Title: The proteolysis of ZP proteins is essential to control cell membrane structure and integrity of developing tracheal tubes in Drosophila.

Abstract: Membrane expansion integrates multiple forces to mediate precise tube growth and network formation. Defects lead to deformations, as found in diseases such as polycystic kidney diseases, aortic aneurysms, stenosis, and tortuosity. We identified a mechanism of sensing and responding to the membrane-driven expansion of tracheal tubes. The apical membrane is anchored to the apical extracellular matrix (aECM) and causes expansion forces that elongate the tracheal tubes. The aECM provides a mechanical tension that balances the resulting expansion forces, with Dumpy being an elastic molecule that modulates the mechanical stress on the matrix during tracheal tube expansion. We show in Drosophila that the zona pellucida (ZP) domain protein Piopio interacts and cooperates with the ZP protein Dumpy at tracheal cells. To resist shear stresses which arise during tube expansion, Piopio undergoes ectodomain shedding by the Matriptase homolog Notopleural, which releases Piopio-Dumpy-mediated linkages between membranes and extracellular matrix. Failure of this process leads to deformations of the apical membrane, tears the apical matrix, and impairs tubular network function. We also show conserved ectodomain shedding of the human TGFÎ² type III receptor by Notopleural and the human Matriptase, providing novel findings for in-depth analysis of diseases caused by cell and tube shape changes.
