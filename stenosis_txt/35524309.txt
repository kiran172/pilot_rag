Title: Anastomotic occlusion after laparoscopic low anterior rectal resection: a rare case study and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: With the development of laparoscopic techniques and the broad clinical application of various anastomotic types, anal-preserving low anterior rectal resection and ultra-low anterior rectal resection have been popularized. Some patients with rectal cancer have retained their anus and improved their quality of life. Nevertheless, the incidence of postoperative anastomotic stenosis remains high, and anastomotic occlusion is even rarer.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of anastomotic occlusion in a patient with rectal cancer, which occurred after undergoing laparoscopic low anterior rectal resection + prophylactic terminal ileal fistulation at our department. Under endoscopy, we used a small guidewire to break through the occluded anastomosis, thereby finding the lacuna. After endoscopic balloon dilation, digital anal dilatation, and continuous dilator-assisted dilation, the desired efficacy was achieved, ultimately recovering ileal stoma. Postoperative follow-up condition was generally acceptable, without symptoms like abdominal pain, bloating, or difficulty in defecation.
CONCLUSION: Numerous factors cause postoperative anastomotic stenosis in patients with rectal cancer. Complete occlusion of anastomosis occurs relatively rare in clinical practice, and is challenging to treat. This case was our first attempt to remove the anastomotic occlusion successfully, which avoided re-operation or pain from the permanent fistula.
