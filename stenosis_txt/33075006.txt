Title: Establishment of a Swine Benign Biliary Stricture Model of Endobiliary Thermal Injury With a Diathermic Sheath.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: A reliable large animal model of benign biliary stricture (BBS) is essential to study endoscopic management of BBS. The aim of this study was to establish a swine BBS model of endobiliary electrothermal injury with a diathermic sheath and screen out the optimal energy dose.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve swine were equally randomized into a low (20 W), a medium (30 W), and a high (40 W)-dose group. Endobiliary electrothermal injury was applied to the common bile duct using a diathermic sheath at different energy doses for 20 seconds via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. Cholangiographic findings and liver function were evaluated weekly after thermal injury. Two animals from each group were sacrificed at 2 weeks and the other 2 sacrificed 4 weeks after thermal injury for histopathologic evaluation.
RESULTS: BBS was established successfully in 10 of the 12 animals. Two of the 4 animals in low-dose group did not produce biliary stricture at 4 weeks; in medium-dose group, BBS was induced in both animals at 2 weeks without causing severe complications; and in high-dose group, BBS was produced in 4 animals at 2 weeks, causing perforation and abdominal abscess formation in 1 animal.
CONCLUSIONS: A safe and reproducible swine model of BBS could be established successfully by applying endobiliary electrothermal injury with a diathermic sheath at 30 W for 20 seconds.
