Title: Post-extubation stridor after prolonged intubation in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU): a prospective observational cohort study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Prolonged endotracheal intubation may lead to laryngeal damage, with stridor being the most relevant clinical symptom. Our objective was to determine the incidence of post-extubation stridor and their clinical consequences in children within a tertiary referral center and to identify contributing factors.
METHODS: 150 children, aged 0-16 years, intubated for more than 24 h were prospectively enrolled until discharge of the hospital. Potential relevant factors, thought to mediate the risk of laryngeal damage, were recorded and analyzed.
RESULTS: The median duration of intubation was 4 days, ranging from 1 to 31 days. Stridor following extubation occurred in 28 patients (18.7%); 3 of them required reintubation due to respiratory distress and in 1 child stridor persisted for which a surgical intervention was necessary. In multivariate analyses, we found the following independent predictors of stridor: intubation on the scene, the use of cuffed tubes and lower age.
CONCLUSION: Despite a high incidence for post-extubation stridor, only few children need reintubation or surgical intervention as a result of post-extubation lesions. Intubation on the scene, the use of cuffed tubes and young age are associated with a significant increased risk of post-extubation stridor. Awareness of these factors gives the possibility to anticipate on the situation and to minimize laryngeal injury and its possible future consequences.
