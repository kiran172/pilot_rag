Title: Percutaneous Balloon-Expandable Stent Implantation to Treat Transverse Aortic Arch Obstruction: Medium- to Long-Term Outcomes of a Retrospective Multicenter Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transverse aortic arch obstruction is a challenging lesion for which stent implantation provides a potentially important alternate therapy. The objectives were to evaluate the technical, procedural, and medium-to-long-term clinical outcomes of percutaneous stent implantation of transverse aortic arch obstruction.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter study of transverse aortic arch stent implantation. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed.
RESULTS: Index catheterization included 187 stent implants in 146 patients. The median age is 14.3 years (interquartile range, 9.3-19), weight is 53 kg (30-69), and follow-up is 53 months (12-120). The most common stent design was open cell (n=90, 48%). Stents overlapped 142 arch vessels (37 carotid arteries) in 118 (81%) cases. Technical and procedural success rates were 100% and 88%, respectively. Lower weight (P=0.018), body surface area (P=0.013), and minimum-to-descending aortic diameter ratio (P&lt;0.001) were associated with higher baseline aortic gradient. The residual gradient was inversely associated with implant and final dilation diameters (P&lt;0.001). The combined incidence of aortic injury and stent-related complications was 14%. There were no reports of abnormal brain scans or stroke. Blood pressure cuff gradient, echocardiographic arch velocity, and hypertension rates improved within 1-year follow-up with increased antihypertensive medication use. Reintervention was reported in 60 (41%) patients at a median of 84 (22-148) months to first reintervention. On multivariable logistic regression, residual aortic gradient &gt;10 mm Hg was associated with increased odds of reintervention at all time points when controlling for each final dilation diameter, weight, and minimum-to-descending aortic diameter ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: Transverse aortic arch stent implantation has high rates of technical, procedural, and medium-to-long-term clinical success. Aortic gradient >10 mm Hg is associated with increased odds of reintervention at 1-year and most recent follow-ups. Open cell stent design was frequently used for its advantages in conformability, perfusion of arch vessels, low fracture rate, and the ability to perform effective angioplasty of side cells.
