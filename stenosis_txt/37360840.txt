Title: Tracheal stenosis and airway complications in the Coronavirus Disease-19 era.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is associated with prolonged intubation and its complications. Tracheal stenosis is one such complication that may require specialized surgical management. We aimed to describe the surgical management of post-COVID-19 tracheal stenosis.
METHODS: This case series describes consecutive patients with tracheal stenosis from intubation for severe COVID-19 infection at our single, tertiary academic medical center between January 1st, 2021, and December 31st, 2021. Patients were included if they underwent surgical management with tracheal resection and reconstruction, or bronchoscopic intervention. Operative through six-month, symptom-free survival and histopathological analysis of resected trachea were reviewed.
RESULTS: Eight patients are included in this case series. All patients are female, and most (87.5%) are obese. Five patients (62.5%) underwent tracheal resection and reconstruction (TRR), while three patients (38.5%) underwent non-resection-based management. Among patients who underwent TRR, six-month symptom free survival is 80%; one patient (20%) required tracheostomy after TRR due to recurrent symptoms. Two of the three (66.7%) of patients who underwent non-resection-based management experienced durable relief from symptoms of tracheal stenosis with tracheal balloon dilation, and the remaining patient required laser excision of tracheal tissue prior to experiencing symptomatic relief.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of tracheal stenosis may increase as patients recover from severe COVID-19 infection requiring intubation. Management of tracheal stenosis with TRR is safe and effective, with comparable rates of success to TRR for non-COVID-19 tracheal stenosis. Non-resection-based management is an option to manage tracheal stenosis in patients with less severe stenosis or in poor surgical candidates.
