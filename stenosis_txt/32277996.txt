Title: Low risk TAVR: Long- term considerations and appropriate patient selection.

Abstract: Recent trials have shown impressive results in low-risk patients undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) with low procedural complication rates, short hospital length of stay, zero mortality, and zero disabling stroke at 30Â days and have led to a Food and Drug Administration indication for TAVR in these patients. The long-term data on subclinical leaflet thrombosis, valve durability, effects of pacemaker implantation, right ventricular pacing, and progressive paravalvular leak is unclear. We describe clinical and procedural considerations for patient selection and introduce future potential procedural challenges. Finally, we discuss the importance of considering life expectancy and durability prior to TAVR in this low risk relatively young cohort and emphasize the importance of a heart team approach.
