Title: Does fractional flow reserve overestimate severity of LAD lesions?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) is increasingly used to estimate the severity of coronary stenoses, prior to coronary revascularization. However, it has been suggested that FFR overestimates the severity of Left Anterior Descending (LAD) lesions. Our aim was to verify whether in patients without ischemia on Myocardial Perfusion Imaging, FFR of the LAD is more often abnormal in comparison to FFR of other coronary arteries.
METHODS: Prospective cohort study of consecutive patients who underwent FFR measurement because of persistent or worsening of angina complaints, within 6 months after normal Myocardial Perfusion Imaging. FFR measurements of a graft or diagonal branch were excluded. A FFR ≤ 0.80 denoted a functionally relevant stenosis.
RESULTS: In 133 patients, 167 FFR measurements were performed, of which 85 in the LAD. Mean age of the patients was 64.8 ± 10.5 years, 40% were women. There were no differences in baseline characteristics between patients undergoing LAD and non-LAD measurements. An abnormal FFR was observed in 35.3% of the LAD measurements, compared to 9.8% in the non-LAD measurements (P = 0.001). Also after adjusting for age and gender, the FFR remained more frequently abnormal in the LAD with OR 5.2 (95% CI 2.2 to 12.3). Of the abnormal FFR LAD measurements, 70% were visually considered non-obstructive on invasive angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: In selected patients without ischemia on MPI, FFR measurement of the LAD is significantly more often abnormal. The majority of these patients has no obstructive lesions on invasive angiography. Possibly, FFR overestimates severity of LAD lesions, with risk of unnecessary revascularization.
