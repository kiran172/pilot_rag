Title: Left Ventricle to Right Atrial Shunt Associated With Ventricular-Atrial Malalignment, Double Outlet Right Atrium, and Subaortic Membrane.

Abstract: We describe an asymptomatic 7-year-old boy who was taken to the operating room for repair of a subaortic membrane and possible Gerbode's defect. He was found to have a double outlet right atrium associated with an accessory atrioventricular valve in addition to a small atrial septal defect and subaortic membrane. Regurgitant flow through this accessory valve led to the left ventricle to right atrial shunt that was seen on preoperative ECHO. The atrial septal defect was repaired and a baffle was used to isolate blood flow across the accessory valve from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 4 and has been doing well 2 years postoperatively.
