Title: Impact of coronary CT angiography in selection of treatment modalities and subsequent cardiovascular events in Thai patients with stable CAD.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) enables improved diagnosis of subclinical, coronary artery disease (CAD). This retrospective cohort study investigated the association between different treatment modalities guided by CCTA and the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with stable CAD.
METHODS: From 2005 to 2013, a total of 9338 patients, including both asymptomatic individuals with risk factors and symptomatic patients with suspected CAD, who underwent CCTA were analyzed. The patients were categorized into one of three groups based on results of CCTA: obstructive CAD (≥ 50% stenosis in at least one vessel), non-obstructive CAD (1-49% stenosis in at least one vessel), and no observed CAD (0% stenosis). They were subsequently followed up to assess the treatment they received and the occurrence of MACEs (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or late revascularization).
RESULTS: During an average follow-up period of 9.9 ± 2.4 years, patients with obstructive CAD had the highest incidence of MACEs (19.8%), followed by those with non-obstructive CAD and no coronary artery stenosis (10.3 and 5.5%, respectively). After adjusting for confounding variables, it was found that patients treated with statins alone were the least likely to develop MACEs in all three groups, compared to those receiving no treatment, with hazard ratios (95% CI) of 0.43 (0.32, 0.58), 0.47 (0.34, 0.64), and 0.46 (0.31, 0.69), respectively. In patients with obstructive CAD, treatment with a combination of statin and aspirin, or early revascularization was associated with a lower likelihood of experiencing MACEs compared to no treatment with hazard ratios of 0.43 (0.33, 0.58) and 0.64 (0.43, 0.97), respectively.
CONCLUSION: CCTA offers useful guidance for the treatment of patients with stable CAD and shows potential for prevention of CV events. However, the full validation of a given strategy utilizing CCTA will require a prospective longitudinal study, utilizing a randomized clinical trial design.
