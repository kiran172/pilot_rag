Title: TAVR - From inoperable to younger, lower-risk patients: A slippery slope?

Abstract: Despite current valve guidelines recommending both transcatheter and surgical aortic valve replacement (TAVR and SAVR, respectively) in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis (AS), TAVR has recently become the preferred treatment over SAVR, driven by its minimal invasiveness, faster recovery and earlier improvement in quality of life. However, several limitations and unresolved issues remain with TAVR, including stroke, conduction system disorder, durability, bicuspid anatomy, coronary reaccess and lifetime management with aortic valve reintervention. Our review aims to highlight the above issues and discuss them in depth, to demonstrate the complementary role of TAVR and SAVR in the treatment of AS.
