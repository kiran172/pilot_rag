Title: Neurocysticercosis With Internal Carotid Artery and Middle Cerebral Artery Vasculitis and Stenosis.

Abstract: A seven-year-old female child presented with sub-acute onset headache, vomiting, and aphasia with right-sided upper motor neuron (UMN) type hemiparesis and ipsilateral UMN type facial nerve weakness. Her coagulation profile and thrombotic profile were normal. MRI brain with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) detected neurocysticercosis causing secondary vasculitis and narrowing of supraclinoid left internal carotid artery (ICA) and middle cerebral artery (MCA). The patient was given aspirin along with steroids and albendazole. She improved gradually, and her hemiparesis and facial nerve palsy improved completely by three months and aphasia by four months.
