Title: Triple-Guidewire Technique for Treating Stent Underexpansion in Severely Calcified Coronary Artery Lesions.

Abstract: Stent underexpansion, a potential complication of percutaneous coronary intervention in severely calcified and stenotic coronary arteries, may result in in-stent thrombosis and restenosis. Different balloon-based and atheroablative techniques have been proposed to reduce the risk of these complications. We describe a simple triple-guidewire technique that we used to treat stent underexpansion in 2 elderly men.
