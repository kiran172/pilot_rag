Title: Obstructive fibrinous pseudomembrane tracheitis after double-lumen tube intubation -a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Obstructive fibrinous pseudomembrane tracheitis (OFPT) is a rare complication of endotracheal intubation.
CASE: We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who underwent short-term intubation for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery and developed an acute life-threatening stridor two days after extubation. The patient required an emergency tracheostomy to maintain airway patency and a microscopic direct laryngoscopy procedure was performed thereafter with removal of the obstructive pseudomembrane. Subsequently, the patient also suffered a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The patient successfully recovered, and the tracheostomy was subsequently decannulated two months later. Histological examination revealed mucosal ulcerations and inflammatory changes.
CONCLUSIONS: OFPT is an uncommon cause of life-threatening airway obstruction after extubation that is not often recognized immediately but can usually be treated with early bronchoscopic intervention or microscopic direct laryngoscopy.
