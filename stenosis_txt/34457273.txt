Title: Low-dose spinal and opioid-free anesthesia in patient with Severe Aortic Stenosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection: Case report.

Abstract: The best anesthesiologic approach to severe AS patient has not been adequately studied in literature. Although the current guidelines have a cautious attitude in this regard, Combined Spinal-Epidural Anesthesia (CSEA) has proved to be a safe technique. Therefore, we would like to provide our experience with a severe AS and COVID-19 patient.
