Title: The Myval Transcatheter Heart Valve System for the Treatment of Severe Aortic Stenosis - Current Evidence and Future Directions.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement has revolutionised the treatment of aortic valve disease. The Myvalâ„¢ device (Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Gujarat, India) is a CE-marked, next-generation balloon-expandable transcatheter heart valve, designed for the treatment of severe aortic valve stenosis. This review illustrates the salient technical features of this transcatheter valve, pre-clinical studies and evidence from the first-in-human trial. We also provide a brief overview of planned clinical trials and registries.
