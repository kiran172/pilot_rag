Title: Elastographic Assessment of Atherosclerotic Plaques and Determination of Vascular Risk in Patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Abstract: Objectives: The present study aimed to examine the role of two-dimensional shear wave elastography (SWE) in the assessment of the vascular wall of the carotid arteries and atherosclerotic plaques in patients with rheumatoid arthritis with moderate and low disease activity versus healthy controls. Methods: An observational case-control study was carried out at the University Medical Hospital "Kaspela" in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, from June 2023 to August 2024. This study included 24 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and 25 healthy controls. We employed two-dimensional SWE (2D-SWE) to examine the vessels around the plaques. The potential links with the degree of stenosis, plaque type, and cardiovascular risk were analyzed. Results: In the RA group, the 2D-SWE values showed significant positive correlations with the severity of the atherosclerotic plaques (rs = 0.461; 95% CI: 0.049 to 0.739; p = 0.023) and the degree of stenosis (rs = 0.920; 95% CI: 0.793 to 0.970; p &lt; 0.001). Based on 2D-SWE, a ROC curve analysis distinguished higher severity plaques from lower severity plaques with an AUC = 0.818, 95% CI: 0.683 to 0.913. The optimal cut-off value of 2D-SWE &gt; 32.40 kPa was associated with a sensitivity of 96%, a specificity of 56%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 66.70%, and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 92.90%. Conclusion: Elastography can be an effective technique for assessing and stratifying atherosclerotic plaques in patients with RA, as well as for aiding in the early detection and subsequent prevention of future complications.
