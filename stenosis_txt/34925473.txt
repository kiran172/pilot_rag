Title: Endovascular stenting with a drug-eluting stent of transplanted renal artery stenosis in a dual kidney transplanted patient.

Abstract: Renal transplant remains the preferred therapy for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Given the shortage of suitable donor kidneys, use of an expanded criteria donor (ECD) allows marginal kidneys to be transplanted; albeit at risk of increased graft failure due to lower nephron mass. To reduce the risk of graft failure, double kidney transplant (DKT) is advocated, with favorable outcomes. Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is one of the most common vascular complications following renal transplant. Unlike single kidney transplants, where TRAS usually presents with fluid overload, uncontrolled hypertension, and worsening kidney functions; it may be clinically silent in DKT patients since they have two functional transplanted kidneys. We hereby report a case of TRAS in a DKT patient who had 2 years of favorable clinical outcomes following successful endovascular stenting. He however recently died of COVID-19 associated pneumonitis.
