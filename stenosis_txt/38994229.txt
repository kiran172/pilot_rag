Title: Association Between Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events and Left Ventricular Mass Index in Patients Who Have Undergone Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography: From the FU-CCTA Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left ventricular mass (LVM) is a predictor of future cardiovascular risk. We determined the association between LVM measured by coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and the prognosis in patients who have undergone CCTA for screening of coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study. Five hundred twenty consecutive patients who underwent CCTA at Fukuoka University Hospital (FU-CCTA registry) were enrolled. They were clinically suspected of having CAD or had at least one cardiovascular risk factor, and were a follow-up of up to 5 years. Equal to more than 50% of coronary stenosis as assessed by CCTA was diagnosed as CAD. Using CCTA, LVM index (LVMI), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LV end-systolic volume were measured. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs: including all causes of death, ischemic stroke, acute myocardial infarction and coronary revascularization). The patients were divided into non-MACEs and MACEs groups.
RESULTS: The non-MACEs and MACEs groups consisted of 478 and 42 patients, respectively. Percent of CAD in the MACEs group was significantly higher than that in the non-MACEs group. The MACEs group showed significantly higher LVMI and tended to have a lower LVEF and LVEDV than the non-MACEs group. Although LVMI was not associated with MACEs in all patients, LVMI was independently associated with MACEs in males (odd ratio: 1.018, 95% confidence interval: 1.002 - 1.035, P = 0.030), but not females.
CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of LVMI by CCTA may be useful for predicting MACEs in males.
