Title: Current Application of NIRS and CPB Initiation Times in German Cardiac Surgery Centers: A Survey.

Abstract: Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been widely used in cardiac surgery to monitor cerebral oxygen supply. The initiation and perioperative management of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) constitute critical events in modifying the normal physiology of adequate blood and oxygen supply to the brain. First, little is known about how frequent NIRS is really used. Second, there are varying practices on how to initiate CPB. We therefore conducted a survey in Germany to get an idea of NIRS usage in cardiac surgery for the duration of initiation of CPB protocols. A web-based e-mail survey using commercial SurveyMonkeyÂ® (SurveyMonkey, San Mateo, CA) software was conducted in August 2017 including all German cardiac surgery centers. About 75% of the perfusion departments do not use NIRS as a standard monitoring device. It is usually reserved for clinical scenarios where cerebral perfusion might be impaired such as aortic arch surgery or carotid artery stenosis. Only one-third of the departments use a standardized duration of initiation of CPB despite a common belief of potential harm with fast initiation. The usual applied time to initiate CPB ranges from 30 to 120 seconds. Our survey revealed that the NIRS technology is only used in specific types of cardiac surgery to this date. In addition, there is a clear need for scientific studies on how to initiate CPB in the best way for the patient.
