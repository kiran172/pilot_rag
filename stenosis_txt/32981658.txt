Title: [Mitral stenosis and acute hemolytic anemia after mitraclip].

Abstract: Mitraclip corrects mitral regurgitation in a less invasive way than cardiac surgery. These procedures are becoming widespread with the emergence of new complications. We report a rare case of mitral stenosis associated with acute hemolytic anemia after mitraclip treatment in an 82-year-old patient. The cause of this stenosis in our case is linked to the placement of two clips and an increase gradient in post-procedure. The mechanism of hemolysis could be due to the persistence of mitral leaks resulting in strong collisions against the clip.
