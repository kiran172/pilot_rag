Title: Radial artery supply to the left mammary artery in a redo coronary bypass.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Single-inflow coronary bypass through left internal thoracic artery and Y graft is effective in myocardial revascularization, but left sublavian diseases may affect its safety.
AIM OF THE STUDY: To assess that, in presence of a composite Y graft, issues involving the origin of the left internal thoracic artery are relatively easy to manage, even in reoperations.
METHODS: A critical stenosis of the subclavian artery involving the origin of a bilateral internal thoracic artery Y graft was bypassed using a free radial artery graft.
RESULTS: Bypass was performed between the left thoracic artery and the ascending aorta, off-pump and with excellent results.
CONCLUSIONS: In consideration of the excellent long term results of total arterial revascularization, radial artery is a feasible graft option, even in case of a composite Y graft in place.
