Title: Tale of a Black Heart!

Abstract: Alkaptonuria is a rare condition of inborn error of metabolism. Association with aortic stenosis has been described; however, diagnosis at the time of valve replacement is infrequent. Recognition of this condition has potential management implications as the durability of prosthetic valves in such cases is unknown. We describe a case report that depicts these unique aspects.
