Title: Overview of Microvascular Angina Pectoris and Discussion of Traditional Chinese Medicine Intervention.

Abstract: Previous research and treatment of coronary heart disease mostly focused on the large epicardial vessels, with limited research on the small endocardial coronary arteries or arterioles that could not be detected by coronary angiography, especially microvascular angina caused by microvascular stenosis or microcirculation dysfunction. Conventional Western medicine therapies have no specific efficacy, but traditional Chinese medicine has significant advantages in this regard. In particular, traditional Chinese medicine of supplementing Qi and activating blood circulation protects the vascular endothelium, relaxes coronary microvessels, reduces myocardial no-reflow after ischemia-reperfusion, increases myocardial hypoxia tolerance, constrains the aggregation of platelet, and increases the rate of blood flow. Moreover, these treatments can significantly improve patients' symptoms through multitarget comprehensive intervention. Here, we analyzed the pathogenesis of microvascular angina pectoris, the treatment status of modern medicine, and the research on the multitarget intervention of traditional Chinese medicine to provide new research ideas for correctly identifying the role of coronary microcirculation in coronary artery disease to solve clinical problems and prevent cardiovascular events.
