Title: Added value of computed tomography venography in the identification of abnormities in veins of lower extremities.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy of direct computed tomography venography (CTV) in early and accurate detection of lower extremity venous (LEV) abnormalities.
METHODS: Cross-sectional research was conducted in Hebei General Hospital of China. A total of 211 CTV reports of both lower extremities from January 2017 to September 2019, 75 color Doppler ultrasound (DUS) examinations, and eight intravascular angiography records of these patients over the same period were collected from the hospital. Comparisons were made for the reported number and percentage of LEV abnormalities (thrombosis, stenosis including severe stenosis, and varicosities). Chi-square test and t-test were applied to compare the rates and means, respectively. Significance level α was 0.05. Individual interviews were performed to understand the perceptions of medical staff and patients on the application of CTV, and the interview results were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 75 cases with both CTV and DUS reports, 159 abnormalities occurring in the lower extremity deep veins (LEDV) were reported, among which 125 (79%) and 18 (11%) were reported by CTV and DUS on a single basis, respectively, whereas 16 (10%) were reported by CTV and DUS simultaneously. A statistically significant greater number of abnormalities in LEDV were identified by CTV than DUS in both males and females (χ2<sub>males</sub> = 78.449, χ2<sub>females</sub> = 27.574, χ2<sub>total</sub> = 104.164, p &lt; .05). In the 211 CTV reports, among the 383 abnormalities reported in total, the common iliac vein (CIV) had the highest number of reported abnormalities (132, 34.5%), followed by the femoral vein (93, 24.3%). The ratios between LEDV abnormality and patient numbers were 1.055 and 0.688 for left and right sides in males, and 0.892 and 0.461 for left and right sides in females, respectively, with that for the left side statistically significantly higher than the right one (t<sub>male</sub> = 2.896, t<sub>female</sub> = 4.347, p &lt; .05). The incidence of thrombosis was 10.9% (95% CI = 6.7 ∼ 15.1%). Reported abnormities in CIV by CTV were in agreement with those by intravascular angiography. The medical staff believed that CTV could guide the performance of surgeries for LEV and the patients perceived CTV acceptable.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of CTV for early and accurate detection of LEDV abnormalities including thrombosis has been proven to be efficient. Corresponding benefit in early intervention and reduction of severe complications of such abnormalities is of important value. CTV earned good recognition from medical staff and patients. Hence, it could be considered as part of global health assistance cooperation with developing countries to facilitate enhanced medical services.
