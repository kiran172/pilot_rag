Title: [Predictive Value of Pancreatic Steatosis for Severity of Coronary Atherosclerosis in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus].

Abstract: Objective To investigate the association of pancreatic steatosis with coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods Patients with T2DM who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography(CCTA)in our center due to chest pain were enrolled from January 2016 to February 2019. According to the CCTA findings,patients were divided into normal group,mild-to-moderate coronary atherosclerosis group and severe coronary atherosclerosis group. CT attenuation of pancreas and spleen was measured on abdominal non-enhanced CT,and the CT attenuation indexes including the difference between pancreatic and splenic attenuation (P-S) and the ratio of pancreas-to-spleen attenuation (P/S) were calculated. Analysis of variance or Kruskal-Wallis rank test were used to assess differences among each group. Logistic regression analysis was used to analyze the risk factors of severe coronary stenosis. The accuracy of P/S in predicting severe coronary artery stenosis was assessed by receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results A total of 173 consecutive T2DM patients were enrolled. These patients included 27 patients with normal coronary artery (15.6%),124 patients with mild to moderate stenosis (71.7%),and 22 patients with severe stenosis (12.7%). There were significant differences in CT attenuation of pancreas (Z=11.543,P=0.003),P-S (Z=11.152,P=0.004) and P/S (Z=11.327,P=0.004) among normal coronary artery group,mild and moderate stenosis group,and severe stenosis group. The CT attenuation of pancreatic head,body,and tail significantly differed in patients with coronary artery stenosis (Z=14.737,P=0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors,multiple Logistic regression showed that P/S (OR=0.062,95%CI=0.008-0.487,P=0.008) was still significantly associated with the severe coronary artery stenosis. The area under the ROC curve of P/S for the diagnosis of severe coronary artery stenosis was 0.701,and the optimal cutoff point was 0.660. Conclusion CT attenuation of pancreas and CT attenuation indexes are associated with the severity of coronary stenosis in T2DM patients,suggesting that pancreatic steatosis may be used as one of the indicators for predicting severe coronary artery stenosis.
