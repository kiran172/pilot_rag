Title: Structural durability of early-generation Transcatheter aortic valve replacement valves compared with surgical aortic valve replacement valves in heart valve surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The current treatment for aortic stenosis includes open surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) as well as endovascular transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study aims to compare the 1-year, 2-3 year and 5-year structural durability of TAVR valves with that of SAVR valves.
METHOD: A systematic literature search was conducted in July 2019 on Medline (via PubMed), Embase and Cochrane electronic databases according to the PRISMA guidelines.
RESULTS: Thirteen randomized controlled trials were included. From the meta-analysis, we observed higher rates of 1-year (OR: 7.65, CI: 4.57 to 12.79, p < 0.00001), 2-3-year (OR: 13.49, CI: 5.66 to 32.16, p < 0.00001) and 5-year paravalvular regurgitation (OR: 14.51, CI: 4.47 to 47.09, p < 0.00001) associated with the TAVR valves than the SAVR valves. There were also higher rates of 1-year (OR: 5.00, CI: 3.27 to 7.67, p < 0.00001), 2-3-year (OR: 8.14, CI: 3.58 to 18.50, p < 0.00001) and 5-year moderate or severe aortic regurgitation (MD: 14.65, CI: 4.55 to 47.19, p < 0.00001), and higher rates of 1-year (OR: 3.55, CI: 1.86 to 6.77, p = 0.0001), 2-3-year (OR: 3.55, CI: 1.86 to 6.77, p = 0.0001) and 5-year reintervention (OR: 3.55, CI: 1.22 to 10.38, p = 0.02) in the TAVR valves as compared to SAVR valves.
CONCLUSION: TAVR valves appear to be more susceptible to structural valve deterioration and thus potentially less structurally durable than SAVR valves, given that they may be associated with higher rates of moderate or severe aortic regurgitation, paravalvular regurgitation and reintervention in the 1-year-, 2-3 year, and 5-year period.
