Title: Identification of the Magna Radicular Artery Entry Foramen and Adamkiewicz System: Patient Selection for Open versus Full-Endoscopic Thoracic Spinal Decompression Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Casually cauterizing the radicular magna during routine thoracic discectomy may have dire consequences.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational cohort study on patients scheduled for decompression of symptomatic thoracic herniated discs and spinal stenosis who underwent a preoperative computed tomography angiography (CTA) to assess the surgical risks by anatomically defining the foraminal entry level of the magna radicularis artery into the thoracic spinal cord and its relationship to the surgical level.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients aged 58.53 ± 19.57, ranging from 31 to 89 years, with an average follow-up of 30.13 ± 13.42 months, were enrolled in this observational cohort study. The mean preoperative VAS for axial back pain was VAS of 8.53 ± 2.06 and reduced to a postoperative VAS of 1.60 ± 0.92 (p &lt; 0.0001) at the final follow-up. The Adamkiewicz was most frequently found at T10/11 (15.4%), T11/12 (23.1%), and T9/10 (30.8%). There were eight patients where the painful pathology was found far from the AKA foraminal entry-level (type 1), three patients with near location (type 2), and another four patients needing decompression at the foraminal (type 3) entry-level. In five of the fifteen patients, the magna radicularis entered the spinal canal on the ventral surface of the exiting nerve root through the neuroforamen at the surgical level requiring a change of surgical strategy to prevent injury to this important contributor to the spinal cord's blood supply.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors recommend stratifying patients according to the proximity of the magna radicularis artery to the compressive pathology with CTA to assess the surgical risk with targeted thoracic discectomy methods.
