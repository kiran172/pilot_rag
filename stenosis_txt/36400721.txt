Title: Two undesirable complications of a blowhole colostomy in left-sided colonic obstruction.

Abstract: Two patients with an acute left-sided colonic obstruction had a successful decompression after construction of a blowhole transverse colostomy as a bridge to surgery. However, they presented with two rather unknown stoma-related complications during this bridging period. Patient A had a stomal prolapse with additional skin problems.Patient B complained of abdominal discomfort during follow-up. The blowhole colostomy appeared to be stenotic. Stoma dilation and irrigation was initiated to prevent complete closure.Definite resection of the left-sided obstruction and reversal of both blowhole colostomies was successful, and the patients recovered without further complications.We hypothesise that incision size may be related to prolapse and stenosis rates and that eversion of the mucosa of the blowhole may reduce the risk of stomal stenosis.
