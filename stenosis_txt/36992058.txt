Title: Wearable Activity Trackers Objectively Measure Incidental Physical Activity in Older Adults Undergoing Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For older adults with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR), recovery of physical function is important, yet few studies objectively measure it in real-world environments. This exploratory study explored the acceptability and feasibility of using wearable trackers to measure incidental physical activity (PA) in AS patients before and after AVR.
METHODS: Fifteen adults with severe AS wore an activity tracker at baseline, and ten at one month follow-up. Functional capacity (six-minute walk test, 6MWT) and HRQoL (SF 12) were also assessed.
RESULTS: At baseline, AS participants (n = 15, 53.3% female, mean age 82.3 Â± 7.0 years) wore the tracker for four consecutive days more than 85% of the total prescribed time, this improved at follow-up. Before AVR, participants demonstrated a wide range of incidental PA (step count median 3437 per day), and functional capacity (6MWT median 272 m). Post-AVR, participants with the lowest incidental PA, functional capacity, and HRQoL at baseline had the greatest improvements within each measure; however, improvements in one measure did not translate to improvements in another.
CONCLUSION: The majority of older AS participants wore the activity trackers for the required time period before and after AVR, and the data attained were useful for understanding AS patients' physical function.
