Title: Cardiovascular Disorder after Cardiotoxic Non-Hodking's Lymphoma Treatment: A Case Report.

Abstract: The non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are a diverse group of lymphoid neoplasms that collectively rank fifth in cancer incidence and mortality. Patients treated with mediastinal radiotherapy and/or anthracycline-containing chemotherapy are known to have increased risks of coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, and heart failure. This may be the result of cancer treatment cardiotoxicity or may be due to accelerated development of cardiovascular disease. We presented 41-year-old male who was admitted to the hospital because of congestive heart failure. He has a medical history of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with anthracycline-based chemotherapy and mediastinal radiotherapy almost 20 years ago. Echocardiography showed significant aortic valve stenosis, thickened and fibrotic pericardium. Coronary angiography showed diffuse three-vessel coronary artery disease. The patient was referred for surgical treatment. Aortic valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting and pericardiectomy were successfully performed, symptoms of heart failure reduced.
