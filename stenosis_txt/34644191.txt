Title: Application of the IntraSPINE® interlaminar device in patients with osteoporosis and spinal stenosis: two case reports.

Abstract: Osteoporosis is a rising concern in the aging population and should be considered before performing spinal surgery for older patients. Nonfusion surgery using interlaminar or interspinous devices is gradually gaining acceptance because adjacent segment disease seldom occurs postoperatively; however, other complications may occur. This report discusses the surgical outcomes of two women with osteoporosis treated by laminectomy and interlaminar device (IntraSPINE®) placement. Both patients had experienced low back pain for several years and had developed vertebral compression fractures. Several conservative treatments, including rehabilitation and local injections, were ineffective. Their bone mineral density levels were -3.0 and -2.8, indicating severe osteoporosis according to the definition established by the World Health Organization. They chose to undergo nonfusion surgery with IntraSPINE® interlaminar device placement. Their pain significantly decreased postoperatively, and their visual analog scale scores decreased from 8 to 2 and 3. Their extremity numbness and back pain resolved within 3 months. Both patients were satisfied with the surgical outcomes. No complications had occurred by 1 year postoperatively. These cases indicate that osteoporosis may not be an absolute contraindication for nonfusion spinal surgery. This report suggests a possible alternative surgical treatment for patients with osteoporosis that is refractory to conservative treatments.
