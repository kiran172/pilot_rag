Title: The association of bicuspid aortic valve on long-term outcome following one-stage repair of aortic arch obstruction associated with ventricular septal defect.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of bicuspid aortic valve on contemporary outcomes, including reoperation rates, after one-stage correction for interrupted aortic arch with ventricular septal defect or for aortic coarctation with hypoplastic aortic arch and ventricular septal defect.
METHODS: Seventy-four consecutive patients (35 boys, 47% and 39 girls, 53%) with interrupted aortic arch (n = 41, 55%) or aortic coarctation with hypoplastic aortic arch (n = 33, 45%) with ventricular septal defect underwent early one-stage correction. Twenty (27%) patients had bicuspid aortic valve, and the remaining 54 (73%) had a tricuspid aortic valve. The median aortic valve annulus diameter was 6.0 mm (IQR: 2.0). Patients' median age was 7 ± 29 days (range, 2-150); median weight was 3.3 ± 0.7 kg (range, 1.5-6.0), with 21 (28%) patients <3.0 kg. Selective brain perfusion through the innominate artery and selective coronary perfusion through the aortic root during aortic arch reconstruction were used in all patients. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 20.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
RESULTS: The early mortality was 1.3%. One premature neonate died in the hospital with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation after aortic coarctation plus ventricular septal defect repair. There was no further mortality. Median follow-up was 5.7 years (IQR: 10.48). Reinterventions occurred in 36 (49%) patients: balloon angioplasty in 18 (24%) patients, reoperations in 4 (5%) patients, and both in 14 (19%) patients. A total of 86 follow-up procedures were required in these 36 (49%) patients: aortic valve valvulopasty (n = 6, 8%), stent implantation (n = 8, 11%), balloon dilatation (n = 39, 53%), and reoperation (n = 33, 45%). The median time to reinterventions was 9.094 years (SE 0.890). A potential risk factor for reintervention after interrupted aortic arch and aortic coarctation with ventricular septal defect repair was bicuspid aortic valve (p = 0.019, Chi2 (1) = 5.457). In addition, a multivariate Cox analysis with backward selection and significance level &lt;0.015 was applied to all variables that showed significant effects in univariable analyzes. This regression confirmed that bicuspid aortic valve (HR = 0.381, p = .016), and interrupted aortic arch (HR = 0.412, p = 0.043) were predictors of late reintervention. All patients had no obvious neurologic impairment in routine examinations at last follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Bicuspid aortic valve was a significant risk factor for valve-related reintervention after one-stage repair for aortic arch obstruction with ventricular septal defect due to later development of stenosis associated with higher late morbidity and mortality. Particularly neonates with bicuspid aortic valve will possibly require reintervention in the future. Regular lifelong cardiac follow-up is recommended.
