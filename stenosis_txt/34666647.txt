Title: Right Atrial Thrombus in a Patient of Rheumatic Heart Disease with Severe Mitral Regurgitation: A Rare Association.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Right atrial thrombus is a rare phenomenon, and its incidence is not well- defined. It usually occurs in the presence of predisposing factors like tricuspid stenosis or following central venous catheterization. Isolated right atrial thrombus without any predisposing factors occurs rarely.
CASE PRESENTATION: We herein report a 30-year-old male patient, a known case of rheumatic heart disease with mitral regurgitation, presented with severe breathlessness and orthopnea. He was diagnosed with acute pulmonary oedema with biventricular dysfunction and congestive symptoms. On transthoracic 2D echocardiography, he was found to have severe mitral and severe tricuspid regurgitation. All cardiac chambers were dilated, and an incidental finding of right atrial thrombus was noted. Patient The patient was managed conservatively, but he succumbed to his worsening heart failure.
CONCLUSION: Treating physicians should be aware of the possibility of right atrial thrombus in rheumatic mitral valve disease because of its clinical implications, like life life-threatening pulmonary embolization and need of surgical management.
