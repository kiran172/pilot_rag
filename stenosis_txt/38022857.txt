Title: Left anterior descending artery disease in a 27-year-old with multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2A: A case report.

Abstract: Multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by medullary thyroid cancer, pheochromocytoma, and primary hyperparathyroidism. Coronary artery disease is associated with the disorder, but the mechanism is unclear. A 27-year-old female presented with chest pain and palpitations. A left heart catheterization was performed and showed 80% stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. Imaging and workup also revealed primary hyperparathyroidism associated with a parathyroid adenoma and elevated serum and urine metanephrines and norepinephrines. A computed tomography of the abdomen revealed a large heterogeneous right adrenal mass measuring 7.9 cm × 6.8 cm × 8 cm consistent with a pheochromocytoma. The patient subsequently underwent adrenal mass resection and a complete thyroidectomy and parathyroidectomy. Early recognition and treatment of multiple endocrine neoplasia 2A can possibly reduce the risk of lethal heart disease in addition to the other associated endocrine disturbances.
