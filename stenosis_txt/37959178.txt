Title: Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement Using Transcatheter Aortic Valve or Dedicated Devices: Current Evidence and Future Prospects.

Abstract: Transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) is a novel and evolving field dedicated to addressing the therapeutic challenges posed by patients at high surgical risk with mitral valve disease. TMVR can be categorized into two distinct fields based on the type of device and its specific indications: TMVR with transcatheter aortic valves (TAV) and TMVR with dedicated devices. Similar to aortic stenosis, TMVR with TAV requires a rigid support structure to secure the valve in place. As a result, it is indicated for patients with failing bioprothesis or surgical rings or mitral valve disease associated with severe mitral annular calcification (MAC), which furnishes the necessary foundation for valve anchoring. While TMVR with TAV has shown promising outcomes in valve-in-valve procedures, its effectiveness remains more contentious in valve-in-ring or valve-in-MAC procedures. Conversely, TMVR with dedicated devices seeks to address native mitral regurgitation, whether accompanied by MAC or not, providing an alternative to Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair (TEER) when TEER is not feasible or expected to yield unsatisfactory results. This emerging field is gradually surmounting technical challenges, including anchoring a valve in a non-calcified annulus and transitioning from the transapical route to the transeptal approach. Numerous devices are presently undergoing clinical trials. This review aims to furnish an overview of the supporting evidence for TMVR using TAV in each specific indication (valve-in-valve, valve-in-ring, valve-in-MAC). Subsequently, we will discuss the anticipated benefits of TMVR with dedicated devices over TEER, summarize the characteristics and clinical results of TMVR systems currently under investigation, and outline future prospects in this field.
