Title: A Case of Giant Goiter Associated with Airway Stenosis Caused by Long-Term Intravenous Epoprostenol Therapy for Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

Abstract: Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is a progressive and life-threatening disease with pulmonary vasculature remodeling, leading to right-sided heart failure. Epoprostenol (prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub>) is highly recommended for patients with severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) categorized by the World Health Organization as functional class III or IV. It has been reported that prostaglandin I<sub>2</sub> analogs can cause thyroid gland swelling and abnormal thyroid function. A 34-year-old woman was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension and started receiving continuous intravenous epoprostenol. Three years after starting epoprostenol, she began complaining of neck swelling and was diagnosed with Graves' disease. The patient's thyroid function was controlled by thiamazole and levothyroxine; nevertheless, her thyroid gland enlargement worsened as the epoprostenol dose was titrated. After 20 years, she developed respiratory failure with a giant goiter leading to airway stenosis, and she passed away. The pathological autopsy confirmed a massive goiter associated with hyperthyroidism and airway stenosis. We experienced a case of idiopathic pulmonary hypertension with a giant goiter and airway stenosis after long-term intravenous epoprostenol therapy.
