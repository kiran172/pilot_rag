Title: Effect of transcatheter aortic valve replacement on ascending aorta dilatation rate in patients with tricuspid and bicuspid aortic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to assess the differences between BAV and TAV patients with chronic moderate to severe or severe AS regarding presentation, incidence of TAVR, survival, ascending aorta diameter and dilatation rate before and after TAVR.
METHODS: The study included 667 consecutive patients with chronic moderate to severe or severe AS from January 2012 and December 2022. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, incidence of TAVR, and ascending aorta diameter and dilatation rate.
RESULTS: There were 185 BAV-AS and 482 TAV-AS patients, and BAV-AS patients were younger (67 vs 78 years, P = 0.027). Total follow-up was 4.5 years (IQR: 2.7-8.9 years), 290 patients underwent TAVR, and 165 patients died. The 8-year TAVR incidence was higher in BAV-AS (55% ± 4%) vs TAV-AS (41% ± 5%; P = 0.02). The 8-year survival was higher in BAV-AS (85% ± 6%) vs TAV-AS (71% ± 6%; P &lt; 0.0001) and became insignificant after age adjustment (P = 0.33). The dilatation rate of ascending aorta was significantly faster in BAV-AS patients compared with TAV-AS patients before TAVR. However, the ascending aorta dilatation rate for BAV-AS and TAV-AS patients was not significantly different after TAVR.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TAV-AS, BAV-AS patients were younger and underwent TAVR more frequently, resulting in a considerable survival advantage. After TAVR, ascending aorta dilatation rates were similar in BAV-AS and TAV-AS patients, suggesting an important role of hemodynamics on ascending aorta dilatation in BAV-AS.
