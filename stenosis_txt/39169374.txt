Title: Psoas attenuation is associated with early postoperative complications in geriatric patients undergoing multilevel lumbar fusion surgery for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Morphometric analysis of the psoas major muscle has shown utility in predicting postoperative morbidity in various surgical fields, but its usefulness in predicting complications in elderly patients undergoing multilevel lumbar fusion surgery has not been studied. The study aimed to investigate if psoas major parameters are independent risk factors of early postoperative complication among elderly patients.
METHODS: Patients who underwent multilevel lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) were included. The psoas major was measured at the lumbar 3/4 intervertebral disc level in three ways on computed tomography image: psoas muscle mass index, mean muscle attenuation, and morphologic change of the psoas major. Early complications were graded using the Clavien-Dindo classification system and the Comprehensive complication index (CCI). A CCI ≥ 26.2 indicated severe complications. Logistic regression was performed to identify independent risk factors.
RESULTS: This retrospective study reviewed 108 patients (mean age 70.9 years, female to male ratio 1.8:1). Complications were observed in 72.2% of patients, with allogeneic blood transfusion being the most frequent (66.7%), followed by wound infection, acute heart failure (2.8% each). Severe complications occurred in 13.9% of patients. After multivariable regression analysis, those in the lowest psoas muscle attenuation tertile had higher odds of experiencing early postoperative complications (OR: 3.327, 95% CI 1.134-9.763, p = 0.029) and severe complications (OR: 6.964, 95% CI 1.928-25.160, p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: The psoas muscle attenuation can be used as a predictor of early postoperative complications in elderly patients undergoing multilevel lumbar fusion surgery for DLSS.
