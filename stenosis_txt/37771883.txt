Title: Gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma 1-year after sleeve gastrectomy.

Abstract: Gastroesophageal malignancy after sleeve gastrectomy is rare. A 70-year-old male with a BMI of 46 underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with normal endoscopy. By 10 months postop, the patient had reduced BMI to 30.5. Eleven months postop, he presented with emesis and endoscopy showed severe stenosis at the gastroesophageal junction with EUS showing a circumferential mass. Patient had adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus HER 3+ and MMR proficient, clinical T2N1. He underwent esophageal stent placement followed by FOLFOX switched to carboplatin-Taxol with radiation therapy complicated by a localized perforation requiring antibiotics. After PET scan of esophageal mass indicated response, he underwent an open distal esophagectomy, total gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y esophagojejunostomy, and placement of feeding tube. Pathology revealed poorly differentiated invasive adenocarcinoma with negative margins. In the USA, this represents only the second adenocarcinoma following a sleeve gastrectomy and the first in a non-immune compromised patient.
