Title: Pulmonary artery reconstruction for non-small cell lung cancer: Surgical management and long-term outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary artery (PA) reconstruction is performed to avoid pneumonectomy for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our objective was to assess the safety and efficacy of performing PA reconstruction without systemic heparinization during resections of NSCLC.
METHODS: Among 3537 patients with resected NSCLC between 2008 and 2019, 130 (3.7%) patients underwent PA reconstruction to avoid pneumonectomy without intraoperative systemic heparinization. We investigated surgical outcome. The median follow-up time was 37 months.
RESULTS: As to PA reconstruction, tangential suture, patch closure (autologous pericardium), end-to-end anastomosis, and conduit were performed in 56, 26, 32, and 16 patients (autologous pericardium, 13; resected pulmonary vein, 3), respectively. Combined bronchial sleeve resection was performed in 68 (52%) patients. The mean operative time was 261 minutes. The procedure-related complications were 2 PA thromboses with pericardial conduit requiring completion pneumonectomy and 2 massive hemoptysis of a bronchopulmonary fistula leading to death (operative mortality, 1.5%). PA bending and mechanical stenosis were due to the lengthening by the conduit. Seventy-five patients had other complications, the most frequent being arrhythmia. One patient was at stage 0 after induction chemoradiotherapy; 26, stage I (9 IA and 17 IB); 43, stage II (19 IA and 24 IB), 55 stage III (49 IIIA and 6 IIIB); and 5, stage IV. Five-year overall survival, cancer-specific survival, and recurrence-free survival rates were 49.2%, 61.8%, and 37.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: PA reconstruction without intraoperative systemic heparinization during resections of NSCLC was performed with a very low risk of thrombosis as well as perioperative bleeding.
