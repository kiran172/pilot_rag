Title: Overcoming very late severe calcific stenosis due to two layers of under-expanded stents with intravascular lithotripsy treatment: A case report.

Abstract: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) shockwave treatment is effective in treatment of severe calcific coronary stenosis within two layers of old under-expanded stents. Intravascular imaging is essential to analyze the mechanism of in-stent failure and optimize treatment.
