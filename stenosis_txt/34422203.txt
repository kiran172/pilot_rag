Title: Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome: a case report with literature review.

Abstract: Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome generally causes calf claudication in young active adult. It is resulting of the anatomical relationship between the popliteal artery and adjacent muscles or fibrous bands in the popliteal fossa. We present the case of a 36-year-old male with left calf claudication limb in whom popliteal artery entrapment syndrome was diagnosed, and successfully treated surgically.
