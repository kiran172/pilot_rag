Title: Does a delay to surgery for preoperative echocardiogram affect outcomes in patients with hip fracture?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Delay to surgery >24 hours has been shown to correlate with mortality rates in patients with hip fracture when left untreated. Many of these patients have multiple comorbidities, including aortic stenosis (AS), and undergo workup for operative clearance, which may delay time to surgery. The purpose of this study was to examine whether preoperative echocardiogram workup affects time to surgery, complications, and mortality after operative fixation for hip fracture.
METHODS: Our institutional hip fracture registry was retrospectively reviewed for inclusion over a 3-year period. Patients who had a preoperative echocardiogram (yECHO) for operative clearance were compared with those who did not (nECHO). Demographic data, time to surgery, overall complication rate, and mortality at 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year were collected.
RESULTS: Two cohorts consisted of 136 yECHO patients (45.8%) and 161 nECHO patients (54.2%). Thirty-two yECHO patients (23.5%) had AS. Patients in the yECHO cohort were more likely to have a complication for any cause compared with nECHO patients (25.7% vs. 10.6%, P = 0.01) and have a higher mortality rate at 1 year (38.9% vs. 17.4%, P = 0.001). There was no association found between AS and all-cause complication (P = 0.54) or 30-day (P = 0.13) or 90-day mortality rates (P = 0.79). However, patients with AS had a significantly higher mortality rate at 1 year (45.8% vs. 25.1%, P = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: This study reinforces the benefits of ensuring less than a 24-hour time to surgery in the setting of a hip fracture and identifies an area of preoperative management that can be further optimized to prevent unnecessary prolongation in time to surgery. Patients with known aortic stenosis are not associated with increased 30-day or 90-day mortality or all-cause complications. Surgical delays in the yECHO cohort were attributed to preoperative medical assessments, including echocardiograms and the management of comorbidities. Therefore, the selective utilization of preoperative echocardiograms is needed and should be reserved to ensure they have a definitive role in guiding the perioperative care of patients with hip fracture.
