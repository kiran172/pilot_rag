Title: Efficacy and Safety of Tirofiban Before Stenting for Symptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis: A Randomized Clinical Trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Acute stent thrombosis (AST) is not uncommon and even catastrophic during intracranial stenting angioplasty in patients with symptomatic high-grade intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). The purpose of this study was to investigate whether adjuvant intravenous tirofiban before stenting could reduce the risk of AST and periprocedural ischemic stroke in patients receiving stent angioplasty for symptomatic ICAS.
METHODS: A prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized clinical trial was conducted from September 9, 2020, to February 18, 2022, at 10 medical centers in China. Patients intended to receive stent angioplasty for symptomatic high-grade ICAS were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive intravenous tirofiban or not before stenting in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcomes included the incidence of AST within 30 minutes after stenting, periprocedural new-onset ischemic stroke, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The outcomes were analyzed using logistic regression analysis to obtain an odds ratio and 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: A total of 200 participants (122 men [61.0%]; median [interquartile ranges] age, 57 [52-66] years) were included in the analysis, with 100 participants randomly assigned to the tirofiban group and 100 participants to the control (no tirofiban) group. The AST incidence was lower in the tirofiban group than that in the control group (4.0% vs 14.0%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.25; 95% CI 0.08-0.82; p = 0.02). No significant difference was observed in the incidence of periprocedural ischemic stroke (7.0% vs 8.0%; p = 0.98) or symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage between the 2 groups.
DISCUSSION: This study suggests that adjuvant intravenous tirofiban before stenting could lower the risk of AST during stent angioplasty in patients with symptomatic high-grade ICAS.

CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that for patients with symptomatic high-grade ICAS, pretreatment with tirofiban decreases the incidence of acute stent thrombosis. This study is Class II due to the unequal distribution of involved arteries between the 2 groups.
