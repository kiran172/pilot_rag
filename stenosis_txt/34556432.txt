Title: Successful Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Based Solely on Non-Invasive Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography.

Abstract: An 81-year-old female presented with chronic coronary disease (Canadian Cardiovascular Society angina severity grading III). The patient underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) that revealed three-vessel coronary artery disease (3VD). This case illustrates that in a patient with 3VD, planning and execution of coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were successfully performed based solely on CCTA combined with fractional flow reserve derived from computed tomography angiography (FFR<sub>CT</sub>). Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was planned and executed as follows: left internal mammary artery grafted to the left anterior descending artery (LAD), saphenous vein graft (SVG) to the right coronary artery (RCA), and SVG to the obtuse marginal artery (OM). Repeat imaging assessment with non-invasive CCTA and FFR<sub>CT</sub> at 30-day follow-up confirmed the safety of this approach. The FFR<sub>CT</sub> values of the RCA and LAD were normalized, whereas a borderline pressure drop was observed in the distal run-off of the OM (FFR<sub>CT</sub>=0.79). Notably, this is the first case in which post-CABG FFR<sub>CT</sub> assessment was performed. Post-CABG FFR<sub>CT</sub> is an investigational novel non-invasive tool for assessing the functional improvement of the epicardial conductance vessels following surgical revascularization.
