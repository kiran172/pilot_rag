Title: Simultaneous Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation and Endovascular Aneurysm Repair for Severe Aortic Stenosis and Symptomatic Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm: Mini Review.

Abstract: Background: The treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis (SAS) who concomitantly present with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is not defined. Aortic valve replacement surgery, performed alone, increases the risk of AAA rupture. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) in the same intervention, especially in high-risk patients, is a safe alternative. Purpose: We report a case of simultaneous endovascular treatment of SAS and AAA and a mini literature review of nineteen cases with similar characteristics. Research design: Case report and literature review. Data Collection: An electronic search of PubMed and Scopus was performed from inception to December 2023. Results: Nineteen case reports of simultaneous transcatheter aortic valve repair and endovascular aneurysm repair for SAS and symptomatic AAA were identified published in the literature. Conclusions: We regard the simultaneous endovascular approach to both pathologies as a promising treatment alternative for selected patients with severe aortic stenosis and abdominal aortic aneurysm. We highlight the need to conduct randomized clinical trials in this patient population.
