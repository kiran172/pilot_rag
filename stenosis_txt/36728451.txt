Title: Recurrent Cerebellar Infarction Caused by Rare Thyroid Steal Syndrome: A Patient Report.

Abstract: Thyroid steal syndrome is an extremely rare condition characterized by recurrent transient ischemic attacks. It is usually detected by the presence of an enlarged thyroid gland or thyroid dysfunction on examination. Herein, the authors reported a case of a severe patient with recurrent cerebellar infarction due to thyroid steal syndrome, which was initially considered to be due to intracranial arterial stenosis based on the patient's computed tomography angiogram but was later found to be due to circulation shunt caused by goiter.
