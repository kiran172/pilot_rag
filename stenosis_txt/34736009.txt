Title: Hybrid laryngotracheal reconstruction vs single and double stage: Indications and outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To describe outcomes from laryngotracheal reconstruction and decannulation rates for patients undergoing single stage, double stage and hybrid staged procedures at a single tertiary care institution and evaluate if the 1.5LTR is a viable reconstructive option for patients with subglottic stenosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review.
SETTING: Tertiary care otolaryngology specialty hospital and internationally.
SUBJECTS: All patients who underwent LTR by a single pediatric otolaryngology surgeon from 2008 to 2018.
METHODS: Charts were assessed for age, gender, etiology, type of reconstruction, comorbidities, length of stay, tracheostomy status and socioeconomic status. Analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel and multivariate logistic regression models.
RESULTS: 96 patients underwent laryngotracheal reconstruction at MEEI. Internationally, 36 patients underwent laryngotracheal reconstruction with the primary surgeon. Overall decannulation rates for ssLTR, dsLTR, and 1.5LTR were 95.6%, 77.8%, and 91.2% respectively. Our Operation Specific Decannulation Rates (one open airway procedure only) for ssLTR, dsLTR, and 1.5LTR were 87.5%, 33%, and 88% respectively. Adjusted odds of decannulation were not significantly different between males and females, white and non-white patients, or socioeconomic status. Neurological comorbidity was statistically significant for a decreased rate of decannulation (p = 0.0216).
CONCLUSION: The 1.5LTR is a viable option for airway reconstruction with strengths derived from both the ssLTR and dsLTR. At our institution we have seen decannulation rates and operation specific decannulation rates with the 1.5LTR approaching our ssLTR. It has replaced the bulk of our dsLTRs, which we reserve for patients that have significant neurological deficits and cannot tolerate extended sedation.
