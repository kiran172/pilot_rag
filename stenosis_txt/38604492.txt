Title: Impact of Tricuspid Regurgitation on Outcomes After Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Development of functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) because of chronic mitral disease and subsequent heart failure is common. However, the effect of TR on clinical outcomes after transcatheter mitral valve replacement (TMVR) remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the impact of baseline TR on outcomes after TMVR. This was a single-center, retrospective analysis of patients who received valve-in-valve or valve-in-ring TMVR between 2012 and 2022. Patients were categorized into none/mild TR and moderate/severe TR based on baseline echocardiography. The primary outcome was 3 years all-cause death and the secondary outcomes were in-hospital events. Of the 135 patients who underwent TMVR, 64 (47%) exhibited none/mild TR at baseline, whereas 71 (53%) demonstrated moderate/severe TR. There were no significant differences in in-hospital events between the groups. At 3 years, the moderate/severe TR group exhibited a significantly increased risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio 3.37, 95% confidence interval 1.35 to 8.41, p = 0.009). When patients with baseline moderate/severe TR were stratified by echocardiography at 30 days into improved (36%) and nonimproved (64%) TR groups, although limited by small sample size, there was no significant difference in 3-year all-cause mortality (p = 0.48). In conclusion, this study investigating the impact of baseline TR on clinical outcomes revealed that moderate/severe TR is prevalent in those who underwent TMVR and is an independent predictor of 3-year all-cause mortality. Earlier mitral valve intervention before the development of significant TR may play a pivotal role in improving outcomes after TMVR.
