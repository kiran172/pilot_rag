Title: Long-term durability of bioprosthetic valves in pulmonary position: Pericardial versus porcine valves.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The long-term durability of the 2 most commonly used types of bioprosthetic valves in the pulmonic position, the porcine and pericardial valves, is unclear. We compared the long-term durability of the pericardial (Carpentier-Edwards PERIMOUNT [CE]) and porcine (Hancock II) valves in the pulmonic position in patients with congenital cardiac anomalies.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 258 cases (248 patients) of pulmonary valve implantation or replacement using CE (129 cases, group CE) or porcine (129 cases, group H) valves from 2 institutions between 2001 and 2009.
RESULTS: The patients' age at pulmonary valve implantation was 14.9 ± 8.7 years. No significant differences in perioperative characteristics were observed between groups CE and H. Follow-up data were complete in 219 cases (84.9%) and the median follow-up duration was 10.5 (interquartile range, 8.4∼13.0) years. Ten mortalities (3.9%) occurred. Sixty-four patients underwent reoperation for pulmonary valve replacement due to prosthetic valve failure; 10 of these 64 patients underwent reoperation during the study period. Patients in group CE were significantly more likely to undergo reoperation (hazard ratio, 2.17; confidence interval, 1.26-3.72; P = .005) than patients in group H. Patients in group CE showed had a greater prosthetic valve dysfunction (moderate-to-severe pulmonary regurgitation or pulmonary stenosis with ≥3.5 m/s peak velocity through the prosthetic pulmonary valve) rate (hazard ratio, 1.83; confidence interval, 1.07-3.14; P = .027) than patients in group H.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the pericardial valve, the porcine valve had long-term advantages in terms of reduced reoperation rate and prosthetic valve dysfunction in the pulmonic position in patients with congenital cardiac anomalies.
