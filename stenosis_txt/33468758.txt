Title: [Right Hemicolectomy and Pancreatoduodenectomy for Transverse Colon Cancer Invasion to the Duodenum-A Case Report].

Abstract: A 74-year-old woman visited her local doctor with stomach ache and weight loss. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a mass in the hepatic flexure of the transverse colon. She was referred to our hospital. Colonoscopy revealed transverse colon cancer in the hepatic flexure. Upper endoscopy showed redness of the mucosa and stenosis in the descending portion of the duodenum. Therefore, duodenal invasion was suspected. The CT scan showed a regional lymph node metastasis, but there were no obvious signs of distant metastases. From the aforementioned findings, we diagnosed the patient with duodenal invasion of transverse colon cancer(cT4b, N1, M0, cStage Ⅲ). There was no intraoperative peritoneal dissemination or liver metastasis, and we performed right hemicolectomy and pancreatoduodenectomy for transverse colon cancer. On histopathological examination, we diagnosed pT4b(Duo, Pan), N1b(3/35), M0, pStage Ⅲb. The patient had delayed gastric emptying after surgery. She recovered conservatively and was discharged on POD 37. She underwent adjuvant chemotherapy( capecitabine therapy)and has been alive without recurrence 8 months after surgery. In some cases of colon cancer invasion of other organs, long-term survival can be achieved if R0 resection is possible, and we should consider extended resection.
