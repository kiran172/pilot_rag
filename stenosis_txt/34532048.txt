Title: Urgent percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation for left ventricular outflow tract obstruction exacerbated after surgical aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Percutaneous transluminal septal myocardial ablation (PTSMA) is an established procedure for treating symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. We report a case of urgent PTSMA for treating refractory heart failure due to exacerbated obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract after surgical aortic valvular replacement to treat severe aortic stenosis.
