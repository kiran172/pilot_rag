Title: Laryngotracheal Stenosis Secondary to Mantle Cell Lymphoma.

Abstract: Acute laryngeal dyspnea is a life-threatening emergency often attributed to laryngeal tumors or inflammatory edema in adults. Primary laryngeal lymphomas are especially infrequent. As an aggressive subtype of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cases are particularly complex.  Herein, we present a case of laryngotracheal stenosis secondary to primary MCL. A comprehensive assessment, including in-office flexible laryngoscopy, revealed distinct findings within the supraglottis and subglottis. In the supraglottis, a submucosal lesion with well-defined, rounded edges was observed, while the subglottis exhibited a friable tumor occupying approximately 90% of the airway. This necessitated immediate intervention, leading to microlaryngoscopy, biopsy, and open tracheostomy. Due to the rarity of primary laryngeal lymphomas, they present a significant diagnostic challenge. Timely diagnosis is crucial to enable tailored therapeutic strategies and improved patient outcomes. This case highlights the importance of considering lymphomatous etiologies in the management of laryngotracheal stenosis and emphasizes the need for a multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient care.
