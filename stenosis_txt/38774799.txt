Title: Myocardial Infarction and Coronary Anomalies in a 25-Year-Old Neurofibromatosis Type 1 Patient.

Abstract: A 25-year-old male with neurofibromatosis type 1 presented with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary imaging revealed an aberrant right coronary anatomy, ectatic coronary arteries, and significant stenosis. Based on previous literature and clinical presentation, this case highlights the potential role of neurofibromatosis in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease.
