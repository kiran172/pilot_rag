Title: Ustekinumab is effective against small bowel lesions in Crohn's disease: two case reports.

Abstract: We encountered two patients with Crohn's disease (CD) for whom induction of ustekinumab was effective for the management of small intestinal lesions with stenosis. The first symptomatic CD case was a 40-year-old female with longitudinal ulcers in the small bowel found at double-balloon endoscopy. She was in a biologic-naïve condition. Her symptoms improved immediately after ustekinumab induction. We confirmed the condition of intestinal mucosa by double-balloon endoscopy. Deep ulcers remained open at 24 weeks and were scarred at 72 weeks. The second case was a 50-year-old male who failed to respond to treatment with anti-TNFα agents. The lumen was narrow caused by circumferential ulcer, and an endoscope could not pass the site before induction. The circumferential ulcer had been healed by ustekinumab induction, and an endoscope passed through at 72 weeks. These two cases support the therapeutic efficacy of ustekinumab in alleviating small bowel lesions in CD patients.
