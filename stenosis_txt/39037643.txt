Title: Geriatricians' role in the management of aortic stenosis in frail older patients: a decade later.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Increasing evidence supports the implementation of geriatric assessment in the workup of older patients with aortic stenosis (AS). In 2012, an online European survey revealed that geriatricians were rarely involved in the assessment of candidates for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). After a "call to action" for early involvement of geriatricians in AS evaluation, the survey was repeated in 2022. Our aim was to investigate whether geriatricians' role changed in the last decade.
METHODS: Online survey conducted between December 16th, 2021, and December 15th, 2022. All members of the European Geriatric Medicine Society were invited to participate. The survey included 26 questions regarding geriatricians' experience with AS and TAVI.
RESULTS: Among 193 respondents (79.8% geriatricians), 73 (38%) reported to be involved in AS evaluation at least once a week. During 2 years prior to the survey, 43 (22.3%) had referred > 50% of their patients with severe AS for TAVI. Age influenced TAVI referral in a considerable proportion of respondents (36.8%). TAVI candidates were mainly referred to specialised cardiac centres with multidisciplinary teams (91.8%), including (47.2%) or not including (44.6%) a geriatrician. A total of 38.9% of respondents reported to be part of a multidisciplinary heart team. Geriatricians were less frequently involved (37%) than cardiologists (89.6%) and surgeons (53.4%) in pre-procedural TAVI management. Cardiologists were more frequently involved (85.5%) than geriatricians (33.7%) and surgeons (26.9%) in post-procedural management.
CONCLUSIONS: Geriatricians' involvement in AS management and multidisciplinary heart teams remains scarce. More efforts should be devoted to implement geriatricians' role in AS decision-making.
