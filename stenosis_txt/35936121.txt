Title: Carotid Endarterectomy Surgeries: A Multimodality Intraoperative Neurophysiological Monitoring Approach.

Abstract: Patients with untreated carotid artery stenosis remain at high risk for stroke. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a surgical procedure for the treatment of symptomatic and severe asymptomatic carotid stenosis. A small percentage of patients who do not have good collateral circulation are at high risk of cerebral ischemia during the cross-clamping of the carotid artery. Aspects of CEA, such as cross-clamping and routine shunting, can also carry the risk of perioperative stroke through dislodgement of emboli causing thrombosis, therefore, selective shunting is highly recommended during the CEA procedure. A multimodality approach of intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) techniques such as somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) and electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to monitor cerebral perfusion throughout the duration of the surgery and to predict the need for a selective shunt after cross-clamping. Additional use of transcranial Doppler (TCD) in the multimodality approach can aid in visualizing the cerebral blood flow and detecting any microemboli that may also cause a stroke. A multimodality IONM approach has been reported as more sensitive and specific for predicting and minimizing any postoperative neurological deficits.
