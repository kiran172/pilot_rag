Title: Efficacy of stent-graft placement to salvage central vein stents with recalcitrant restenosis in patients with arteriovenous fistulas.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness and permanency of stent-graft placement to salvage stents with recalcitrant restenosis due to central vein stenosis (CVS). Between May 2014 and February 2016, VIABAHN stent-grafts were deployed in patients with functioning arteriovenous (AV) fistulas who underwent previous bare metal stent (BMS) placement and had recalcitrant stent restenosis that did not respond to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Surveillance was carried out at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months with diagnostic fistulography. Fourteen patients initially underwent 15 BMS placements. In the follow-up period (range, 118-976 days), patients presented with symptomatic venous hypertension; subsequently, a total of 52 unsuccessful repeat PTAs for BMS restenosis were undertaken, and the median primary access survival of PTAs was 66 ± 43 days. For salvage, 14 stent-grafts were placed in segments with recalcitrant restenosis of a CVS stent. Within 1.25 ± 0.72 days after stent-graft placement, patients who initially presented with symptomatic venous hypertension reported complete resolution. The median primary access survival (mean, 1183 ± 312 days) was longer than PTAs alone (P < .01). No major or minor complications were associated with stent-graft deployment or any of the subsequent interventions in the study period. The primary patency rate at 6, 12, and 18 months was 100%, and it was 85.7% at 24 months. The secondary access patency rate was 92.9% at 24 months. In conclusion, stent-graft placement to salvage CVS stents with recalcitrant restenosis in patients with AV fistulas is safe and effective if PTAs fails to maintain luminal patency.
