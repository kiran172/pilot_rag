Title: Efficacy of nasal continuous positive airway pressure as a preferred airway management during intravenous sedation of patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: As the incidence of aortic stenosis is increasing in correlation with the aging population, symptomatic patients commonly require valve replacement procedures. If left untreated, symptomatic aortic stenosis can lead to death in 2 to 3 years. Often, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures are performed with the assistance of oxygenation via nasal cannula. However, oxygenation achieved through a nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP) device could be a more optimized strategy for patients without any sacrifice in efficacy compared to nasal cannula.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on 28 patients at Baylor University Medical Center who presented to the operating room for a TAVR between January and October 2021. Fourteen patients received oxygenation via nasal cannula (control group) and 14 received oxygenation with nCPAP. Information gathered included method of oxygenation, length of stay, episodes of hypoxia (defined as sustained oxygen saturation <92% for at least 1 minute), paravalvular leak, pacemaker placement, and mean atrial valve (AV) gradient before and after the procedure.
RESULTS: In the nCPAP group, the average length of stay was 2.79 days vs 2.71 days in the nasal cannula group. In the nCPAP group, no patient required a permanent pacemaker, while the nasal cannula group had a 40% rate of permanent pacemaker placement. The average preprocedure AV gradient was 51.14 in the nCPAP group and 42.57 in the nasal cannula group. The average postprocedure AV gradient was 8.5 in the nCPAP group and 5.36 in the nasal cannula group. Both groups had an intensive care unit admission rate of 0%. The rate of paravalvular leak was 35.7% in the nCPAP group and 28.6% in the nasal cannula group. The nCPAP group had an average of 0 episodes of hypoxia and the nasal cannula group had an average of 0.93 episodes of hypoxia.
CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrate the viability of nCPAP as an effective method of oxygenation during intravenous sedation of TAVR patients when compared to oxygenation achieved via nasal cannula during TAVRs.
