Title: Comparison of Lower and Upper Extremity Arteriovenous Graft: A Retrospective Clinical Analysis with 5-Year Follow-Up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For patients in whom an upper extremity (UE) vascular access cannot be established, the lower extremity (LE) arteriovenous graft (AVG) could be selected. However, the application of LE AVG is limited owing to its high infection rate, uncertain patency time, and technical difficulties. This study aimed to compare the long-term patency rates and the incidence of vascular access complications of AVG in the LE and UE to provide a reference for the applications of AVG, especially in the LEs.
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients who successfully underwent LE or UE AVG placement from March 2016 to October 2021. Patient characteristics were collected and compared using parameter or nonparameter tests according to data type. Postoperative patency was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier test. Postoperative complication incidence density and intergroup comparison were estimated using the Poisson distribution.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients with LE AVG and 120 patients with UE AVG were included. The 1-year primary patency rate was 67.4% (±11.0% standard error [SE]) in the LE group and 30.1% (±4.5% SE) in the UE group (P = 0.031). The assisted primary patency rate at postoperative months 12, 24, and 36 was respectively 78.6% (±9.6% SE), 65.5% (±14.4% SE), and 49.1% (±17.8% SE) in the LE group and 63.3% (±4.6% SE), 47.5% (±5.4% SE), and 30.4% (±6.1% SE) in the UE group (P = 0.137). The secondary patency rate at postoperative months 12, 24, and 36 remains 95.5% (±4.4% SE) in the LE group and 89.3% (±2.9% SE), 83.7% (±3.9% SE), and 73.0% (±6.2% SE), respectively, in the UE group (P = 0.200). Postoperative complications included stenosis, occlusion/thrombosis, infection, steal syndrome, pseudoaneurysm, severe postoperative serum swelling, and AVG exposure. The total incidence rates of postoperative complications were 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59-1.23) versus 1.61 (95% CI 1.45-1.79) (P = 0.001) cases/person-year, the incidence rates of stenosis were 0.45 (95% CI 0.26-0.73) versus 0.92 (95% CI 0.80-1.06) (P = 0.005) cases/person-year and the incidence rates of occlusion/thrombosis were 0.34 (95% CI 0.17-0.59) versus 0.62 (95% CI 0.52-0.74) cases/person-year in the LE group compared to those in the UE group (P = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS: LE AVG had higher primary patency rate and lower postoperative complication incidence than UE AVG. With the development of interventional technology, both LE AVG and UE AVG exhibited high secondary patency rates. LE AVG can be a reliable and long-term alternative for appropriately selected patients with unusable UE vessels.
