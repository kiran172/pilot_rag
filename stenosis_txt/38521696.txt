Title: Evaluation of Left Ventricular Function in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis Utilizing Automated Cardiac Motion Quantitation Techniques.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to explore the patterns of alteration in left ventricular systolic function among patients with severe aortic stenosis (SAS) through the application of automatic myocardial motion quantification (aCMQ) techniques. Furthermore, we seek to ascertain dependable quantitative markers for the assessment of impaired left ventricular function in patients with SAS and an ejection fraction (EF) ≥ 60%.
METHODS: Seventy patients who underwent echocardiography and received a diagnosis of severe aortic stenosis (SAS) in the hospital from November 2021 to August 2022 were selected for the SAS group and categorized into three subgroups based on ejection fraction (EF)-SAS group with EF ≥ 60%, SAS group with EF ranging from 50% to 59%, and SAS group with EF < 50%. Concurrently, 30 healthy individuals were recruited at the hospital during the same timeframe to serve as the control group. Participants from both groups underwent standard transthoracic echocardiography to assess conventional echocardiographic parameters. Dynamic images were examined using automatic myocardial motion quantification (aCMQ) software to derive longitudinal peak strain (LPS) parameters, which were then subjected to statistical analysis.
RESULTS: In comparison to the control group participants, the measurements of ascending aorta diameter (AoD), left atrium diameter (LAD), interventricular septal end diastolic thickness (IVSd), left ventricular posterior wall end diastolic thickness (LVPWd), peak systolic velocity (Vmax), and mean pressure gradient (MPG) were significantly higher in the SAS groups (p < 0.05). When compared to participants in the SAS group with an EF ≥ 60%, the values of IVSd, LVPWd, Vmax, and MPG in the SAS group with EF ranging from 50% to 59% were significantly elevated (p < 0.05). Similarly, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), the ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow velocity to early diastolic mitral annular velocity (E/e'), and the ratio of early to late diastolic mitral inflow velocities (E/A) in the SAS group with EF < 50% were significantly elevated (p < 0.05). The absolute values of longitudinal peak strain (LPS) in the SAS groups were significantly lower in comparison to those in the control group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, all measurements of left ventricular global longitudinal systolic peak strain (GLPS) showed a positive correlation with MPG, a moderate negative correlation with aortic valve area index (AVAI), and a moderate positive correlation with E/A.
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SAS and an EF < 50% exhibited the most profound impairment in left ventricular myocardial function. Utilizing the aCMQ technique enables the precise and quantitative evaluation of the severity of impaired left ventricular systolic function in patients within the SAS group with an EF ≥ 60%.
