Title: General Anesthesia With Remimazolam and Peripheral Nerve Blocks Is Useful for Femoral Surgery in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Traditional intravenous anesthetics and opioid analgesics are susceptible to inducing hemodynamic instability. Herein, we describe a case of open reduction and internal fixation of a femoral neck fracture in a patient with severe aortic stenosis. General anesthesia was accomplished using remimazolam, an intravenous anesthetic devoid of hemodynamic instability properties, in combination with a peripheral nerve block. During the surgical procedure, the need for circulatory agonist was reduced to a single dose, and satisfactory pain management was achieved. This approach represents an alternative method for patients with circulatory risk undergoing femoral surgery.
