Title: Two Decades Using Stentless Porcine Aortic Root in Right Ventricular Outflow Tract Reconstruction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The stentless porcine aortic root prosthesis (SPAR) has been described as a suitable valve for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction (RVOTR). Indiana University Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis, Indiana began using this valve for RVOTR in 1998. This study reports medium-term to late- term outcomes of the valve in the pulmonary position.
METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of patients older than 18 years of age who underwent RVOTR with a SPAR between April 2000 and October 2019. Primary outcomes included survival and freedom from any valvular reintervention. Secondary outcomes included endocarditis and conduit dysfunction detected by routine echocardiography or cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: A total of 135 patients underwent RVOTR with a SPAR at a median age of 32.4 years (range, 18 to 71 years). Of these patients, 129 had previous surgery. Indications included pulmonary insufficiency (90.4%), stenosis (34.8%), endocarditis (7.4%), and carcinoid (4.4%). Median follow-up was 2.97 years (interquartile range, 0.6 to 8.0 years). Overall survival was 93.3%, with 3 perioperative death and 6 late deaths. Endocarditis developed in 4 patients (2.9%), 2 of whom required reoperation. Progressive conduit degradation was evident at 10 years, with 22.2% and 7.7% having moderate stenosis and insufficiency, respectively. Eight (5.9%) reinterventions included 2 surgical replacements, 3 percutaneous replacements, and 3 balloon valvuloplasties at means of 8.5, 7.4, and 2.2 years, respectively. Overall freedom from reintervention at 1, 5, and 10 years was 99.1%, 94.7% and 90.7%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this large, single-institution experience with a long follow-up period, use of the SPAR demonstrated excellent midterm to long-term durability, low rates of endocarditis, and high freedom from reintervention.
