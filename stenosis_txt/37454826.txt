Title: Functional and Quality of Life Outcomes After TAVR in Patients With Low Gradient Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Severe aortic stenosis is a common valvular heart disease associated with significant mortality and morbidity. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an effective treatment for this condition. Less data is available regarding functional and quality-of-life outcomes in patients with severe, low-gradient aortic stenosis following TAVR. This single-center, retrospective study compared changes in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) scores at 30 days and 1 year in patients with 3 variants of severe, low-gradient aortic stenosis following TAVR. Secondary outcomes included 1-year major adverse cardiovascular event. A total of 170 patients were included. All 3 low-gradient variants had significant improvement in NYHA class and KCCQ overall scores at 30 days and 1 year. There were no significant differences in KCCQ overall scores between the 3 groups and no significant differences in secondary outcomes. Patients with low-gradient aortic stenosis experienced significant improvements in functional and quality-of-life outcomes following TAVR.
