Title: Treatment strategy of hilar and intraglandular stones in wharton's duct: A 12-year experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To suggest a strategy for transoral removal of hilar and intraparenchymal submandibular stones.
STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective case series.
METHODS: Retrospective evaluation was performed for 514 consecutive patients with hilar and intraparenchymal submandibular stones treated via endoscopy-assisted surgery from January 2006 to June 2018. Three patients had bilateral stones. The stones were classified as: hilar (type I), posthilar (type II), intraparenchymal (type III), and multiple stones (type IV).
RESULTS: The affected glands included 311 with type I, 84 with type II, 65 with type III, and 57 with type IV stones. Stones were successfully removed in 478 glands (92.5%, 478/517). Main treatment techniques included hilum ductotomy in 311 glands, intraparenchymal ductotomy in 68, submandibulotomy in 14, intraductal retrieval in 74, and hilum ductotomy accompanied by intraductal retrieval in 11. At a mean 40-months follow-up of 478 successful cases, clinical outcomes were good in 425, fair in 27, and poor in 26 glands. Postoperative sialograms in 75 stone-free patients were categorized as: type I, normal (n = 6); type II, ectasia or stenosis in the main duct and no persistent contrast on functional films (n = 44); type III, ectasia or stenosis in the main duct and mild contrast retention (n = 15); and type IV, poor shape of the main duct and evident contrast retention (n = 10). Postoperative sialometry of 32 patients revealed no significant differences of the gland function between the two sides.
CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate use of various endoscopy-assisted approaches helps preserve the gland and facilitates recovery of gland function in patients with different depths of hilo-parenchymal submandibular stones.
