Title: Safety and efficacy of the Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support stent in treating intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The performance of the Low-Profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) stent deployed following balloon angioplasty is unknown in treating intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, and this study was to investigate the safety and efficacy of the LVIS stent in treating intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in the middle cerebral artery M1 segment.
METHODS: Thirty-five patients were enrolled with 35 atherosclerotic stenoses at the M1 segment. The stenosis was about 75% in 16 patients, 80% in 15, and 90% in the rest four. The LVIS stent was used to treat these patients.
RESULTS: The success rate of stenting was 97.1%. The stenting procedure was failed in one patient because of intraprocedural dissection of the stenotic (75%) segment, resulting in a 30-day periprocedural complication rate of 2.9% (1/35). Before stenting, the stenosis rate ranged 75%-90% (mean 78.9%±4.7%), and after stenting, the diameter of the stented segment was significantly (P<0.0001) increased to 1.5-3.4mm (mean 2.1±0.32mm) ranging 68.2%-100% (mean 94.0%±5.8%) of the normal arterial diameter, with the residual stenosis ranging 0-31.8% (median 4.8%, IQR 2.4%-7.3%). Follow-up was performed at 6-20 months (mean 8.5) after stenting. One patient (2.9%) had occlusion of the stented M1 segment with no symptoms, and two patients (5.7%) had slight asymptomatic instent stenosis (40%) at the M1 segment, with the instent restenosis and occlusion rate of 8.6% (3/35).
CONCLUSION: The braided LVIS stent can be safely applied for treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis in the middle cerebral artery with good safety and efficacy immediately after stenting and at follow-up.
