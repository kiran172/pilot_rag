Title: [Bolus obstruction within the esophagus - an analysis over 5 years].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The removal of bolus impaction within the esophagus is an indication for emergency endoscopy. The current guideline of the European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) recommends gently pushing the bolus into the stomach. This view is discerned by many endoscopists because of the increased risk of complications. In addition, the use of an endoscopic cap for bolus removal is not mentioned.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In a retrospective analysis from 2017 to 2021 we investigated 66 adults and 11 children with acute bolus impaction within the esophagus.
RESULTS: Eosinophilic esophagitis, reflux esophagitic /peptic stenosis and Schatzki Ring caused 57.6%, esophageal and bronchial carcinoma 18%, esophageal motility disorders 4.5%, Zenkers diverticulum 1.5% and radiation esophagitis 1.5% of the bolus obstructions. The reason remained unclear in 16.7% of the cases. The spectrum was comparable in children with additional 2 cases with esophageal atresia and stenosis. The reason was unclear in 2 cases. Removal of bolus impaction was successful in 92.4% in adults and 100% in children. Bolus obstruction in adults was successfully removed solely by endoscopic cap in 57.6% and 75% in children. Pushing the bolus into the stomach without disintegration was possible in only 9% of cases.
CONCLUSION: Flexible endoscopy is an effective ermergency intervention for removal of bolus obstruction within the esophagus. Uncontrolled pushing the bolus into the stomach without view cannot be recommended. An endoscopic cap is a good extension for safe bolus removal.
