Title: Inter-racial differences in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Little information exists about inter-racial differences in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We investigated whether differences in baseline characteristics between Asian and non-Asian population may contribute to disparities in clinical outcomes after TAVI.
METHODS: We performed a registry-based, multinational cohort study of patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI at two centres in the USA and one centre in South Korea. The primary outcome was a composite of death, stroke or rehospitalisation at 1 year.
RESULTS: Of 1412 patients, 581 patients were Asian and 831 were non-Asian (87.5% white, 1.7% black, 6.1% Hispanic or 4.7% others). There were substantial differences in baseline characteristics between two racial groups. The primary composite outcome was significantly lower in the Asian group than in the non-Asian group (26.0% vs 35.0%; HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.89; p=0.003). However, after adjustment of baseline covariates, the risk of primary composite outcome was not significantly different (HR 0.79; 95% CI 0.60 to 1.03; p=0.08). The all-cause mortality at 1 year was significantly lower in the Asian group than the non-Asian group (7.4% vs 12.5%; HR 0.60; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.88; p=0.009). After multivariable adjustment, the risk of all-cause mortality was also similar (HR 1.17; 95% CI 0.73 to 1.88; p=0.52).
CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in baseline and procedural factors among Asian and non-Asian patients who underwent TAVI. Observed inter-racial differences in clinical outcomes were largely explained by baseline differences in clinical, anatomical and procedural factors.
