Title: A Missed Diagnosis of Laryngotracheal Injury Secondary to Emergency Intubation: Lessons Learned.

Abstract: Iatrogenic laryngotracheal trauma is a potentially fatal complication of endotracheal intubation, especially in an emergency setting. Symptoms are almost always related to speech, breathing, and swallowing. Hoarseness being the commonest symptom, while shortness of breath and stridor always signify more devastating injury. We present a case of iatrogenic subglottic and tracheal stenosis, which was misdiagnosed in the emergency department during the first visit. This case report highlights the importance of salient history and thorough examination with a high index of suspicion in a stridorous case with a recent history of intubation. Early detection and management are vital to avoid a life-threatening event.
