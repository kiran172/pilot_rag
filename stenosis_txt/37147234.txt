Title: A stomaplasty for total laryngectomy with a previous tracheostomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Stomaplasties were widely used to prevent or revise stomal stenosis, however, a previous tracheostomy can limit the choice of some techniques. This study aims to deal with this condition through a novel and simple technique called "Collar stomaplasty".
METHODS: This study involved 43 patients submitted for laryngectomy between 2017 and 2020. A tracheostomy 6-31 days prior to laryngectomy was performed in all cases. The collar stomaplasty, shaping the previous tracheostomy and surrounding skin, included 17 cases and the traditional X-shaped stomaplasty included 26 cases. Fisher's exact test was applied in an intergroup comparison of complications.
RESULTS: One out of the collar stomaplasty group demonstrated perioperative stomal infection and avascular necrosis (5.9%). Another developed stomal stenosis (5.9%). In the X-shaped stomaplasty group, necrosis at the tip of the tracheal flap occurred in 14 cases (53.8%), and stomal stenosis occurred in 5 cases (19.2%). A statistically significance occurred in stomal necrosis (p<0.05) while no statistically difference is observed in stomal stenosis (p>0.05) between these two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The collar stomaplasty technique creates a laryngectomy tracheostoma by remodeling a previous tracheostomy. A wide and stable stoma, which facilitates stomal care, can be accomplished by this simple technique.
