Title: Outcomes of Endovascular Management of Isolated Profunda Femoris Artery Occlusive Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endovascular management of isolated profunda femoris artery occlusive disease has not been well studied. Our aim is to analyze the outcomes of endovascular management of profunda artery occlusive disease.
METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis using data from the Vascular Quality Initiative. All patients from 2013 to 2018 treated percutaneously for isolated profunda artery occlusive disease were included. Endovascular treatment included plain balloon alone, stent, stent graft, atherectomy, and drug-coated balloon without any concomitant endovascular or surgical treatment. Demographic, procedural, and follow-up data were obtained. Primary end points were primary patency, improvement of symptoms, and need for reintervention. Univariate and multivariable analysis was used to assess for significant variables.
RESULTS: Of the 105,568 lower extremity endovascular interventions performed during this time period, there were 361 procedures (0.3%) performed on 341 patients for isolated profunda artery occlusive disease. The average age of these patients was 67.8 years (+/- 11.8), with 59.8% being men. The most common indication for treatment of the profunda artery was claudication (44.8%), followed by tissue loss (28.5%) and rest pain (26.0%). The most common treatment modality was plain balloon (58.5%), followed by stent (18.6%), drug-coated balloon (10.0%), atherectomy (9.4%), and stent graft (3.6%). At a mean follow-up of 13 months (+/-4.6), data were available for 238 patients (69.7%). Overall primary patency at 13 months was 92.9%. There was no significant difference in terms of patency for each treatment modality (Table I). Preoperative ambulatory status, aspirin, and statin were significantly associated with patency. At most recent follow-up, 67% of patients had improvement of their symptoms, whereas 29% were unchanged. Reintervention data were available for 247 patients, with a reintervention rate of 15.8% (n = 39) and a mean reintervention time of 226 days (+/- 173), with the majority of reinterventions (62%) occurring in the plain balloon group. Reinterventions were primarily endovascular (64%) with 9 patients (23%) undergoing surgical reintervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular management of profunda femoris artery occlusive disease has acceptable one-year patency rates with low reintervention rates. Endovascular treatment may be an acceptable alternative to selected patients who are high-risk for surgery.
