Title: Postoperative outcome of tracheal resection in benign and malignant tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tracheal or cricotracheal resection is the standard of care for definitive treatment of tracheal stenosis. However, the incidence is low, the management is complex, and only a few centres have reported their experience. Therefore, more clinical reports on this topic are needed.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent tracheal or cricotracheal resection for malignant or benign tracheal stenosis in our institution between 2001 and 2016. Fisher&rsquo;s exact test was used for analysis of complications and recurrence. P-value &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: 37 patients, aged 19&ndash;74, underwent tracheal (n = 21, 56.8%) or cricotracheal (n = 16, 43.2%) resection for idiopathic (n = 15, 40.5%), neoplasm-related (n = 11, 29.7%), postintubation/-tracheotomy (n = 10, 27%), and congenital (n = 1, 2.7%) stenosis. Cervical incision was applied in 28 patients (75.7%), and an extended access (5 thoracotomy, 3 hemiclamshell, 1 partial-sternotomy) was required in 9 patients (24.3%). Mediastinal lymphadenectomy was done in 7 patients (18.9%), all with neoplasm-related stenosis. Median resection length was 2.8 cm (range 1.0&ndash;6.0), and longer than 4.0 cm in 6 cases (16.2%). Release manoeuvre was performed in 7 patients (18.9%). All patients were extubated immediately after surgery and median hospital stay was 5 days (range 3&ndash;15). Median follow-up was 6 months (range, 1-93). There was no 30-day mortality, and no dehiscence or fistula occurred at the suture line. Complications were seen in 11 patients (29.7%), significantly correlating to malignant stenosis (p = 0.011) and surgical procedure, meaning extended access (p = 0.011), mediastinal lymphadenectomy (p = 0.016), and release manoeuvres (p = 0.016). Temporary hoarseness was the most common complication (n = 5, 13.5%), but remained persistent in only one patient (n = 1, 2.7%). Recurrence was seen only in patients with idiopathic stenosis (n = 5, 13.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirm good efficacy for surgical resection of tracheal stenosis. The complication rate is relatively low in comparison to the literature, suggesting the importance of managing tracheal stenosis in a tertiary referral centre.
