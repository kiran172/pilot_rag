Title: Aortic valve repair for the treatment of rheumatic aortic valve disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: Valvuloplasty for rheumatic aortic valve disease remains controversial. We conducted this study to explore whether aortic valvuloplasty is appropriate for the rheumatic population. A comprehensive search was conducted, and 7 eligible retrospective studies were identified from PubMed, Embase, Medline and Cochrane (up to April 7, 2020) according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data for hospital mortality, 5-year survival, 5-year reoperation, aortic insufficiency grade (AIG) and aortic valve gradient (AVG) were extracted by 2 independent reviewers and were analysed to evaluate the safety and availability of aortic valvuloplasty for rheumatic patients. The heterogeneity of the results was estimated using the Q test and I2 statistics. The fixed pooling model was used when I2 ≤ 50%; otherwise, the random pooling model was selected. 7 articles with 418 patients were included. The pooled hospital mortality, 5-year survival and 5-year reoperation rates were 3.2%, 94.5% and 9.9%, respectively. The heterogeneities of the weighted mean differences (WMD) values of the AIG and AVG between preoperation and postoperation were extremely high (I2 = 81.5%, p &lt; 0.001 in AIG, I2 = 97.6%, p = 0.003 in AVG). Subgroup analysis suggested that the AIG and AVG were improved by 3.03 grades (I2 = 0%, p &lt; 0.001) and 3.16 mmHg (I2 = 0%, p &lt; 0.001) in the European group, respectively. In the Asian group, the AIG and AVG were improved by 2.57 grades (I2 = 0%, p &lt; 0.001) and 34.39 mmHg (I2 = 0%, p &lt; 0.001), respectively. Compared with the values at discharge, the AIG was increased by 0.15 grades (I2 = 0%, p = 0.031) and the AVG was still decreased by 2.07 mmHg (I2 = 0%, p = 0.031) at the time of follow up. Valvuloplasty is safe and effective to treat rheumatic aortic insufficiency and stenosis, and the duration of maintenance required to improve stenosis was longer than that of insufficiency.
