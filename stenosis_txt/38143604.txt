Title: Supraventricular Tachycardia Associated With Repeat Cesarean Section Under Spinal Anesthesia.

Abstract: Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is the most common tachyarrhythmia of pregnancy. Catecholamine surges, the use of vasoactive agents during delivery, and increased cardiac output during pregnancy are the most common contributing factors to developing SVT. SVT is usually benign in presentation but can lead to more serious arrhythmias in patients with a history of mitral stenosis secondary to rheumatic heart disease. When an SVT is detected, organic heart causes should be ruled out first. Symptoms of SVT include shortness of breath, palpitations, syncope, sweating, chest pain, and dizziness. In patients who are refractory to pharmacologic management and hemodynamically unstable, electrical cardioversion has proven to be efficacious and safe in all trimesters. The initial treatment for hemodynamically stable patients is to attempt vagal maneuvers, such as carotid sinus massage or Valsalva maneuver. If the SVT does not convert to normal sinus rhythm, treatment with adenosine or beta-blockers may be initiated. Treatment with atenolol and verapamil should be avoided due to their teratogenic effects.
