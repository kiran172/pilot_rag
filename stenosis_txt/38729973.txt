Title: Low-density lipoprotein particle profiles compared with standard lipids measurements in the association with asymptomatic intracranial artery stenosis.

Abstract: The Shiga Epidemiological Study of Subclinical Atherosclerosis was conducted in Kusatsu City, Shiga, Japan, from 2006 to 2008. Participants were measured for LDL-p through nuclear magnetic resonance technology. 740 men participated in follow-up and underwent 1.5 T brain magnetic resonance angiography from 2012 to 2015. Participants were categorized as no-ICAS, and ICAS consisted of mild-ICAS (1 to < 50%) and severe-ICAS (≥ 50%) in any of the arteries examined. After exclusion criteria, 711 men left for analysis, we used multiple logistic regression to examine the association between lipid profiles and ICAS prevalence. Among the study participants, 205 individuals (28.8%) had ICAS, while 144 individuals (20.3%) demonstrated discordance between LDL-c and LDL-p levels. The discordance "low LDL-c-high LDL-p" group had the highest ICAS risk with an adjusted OR (95% CI) of 2.78 (1.55-5.00) in the reference of the concordance "low LDL-c-low LDL-p" group. This was followed by the concordance "high LDL-c-high LDL-p" group of 2.56 (1.69-3.85) and the discordance "high LDL-c-low LDL-p" group of 2.40 (1.29-4.46). These findings suggest that evaluating LDL-p levels alongside LDL-c may aid in identifying adults at a higher risk for ICAS.
