Title: Transcatheter aortic valve with a novel self-expandable device in patients with previous mechanical mitral valve prosthesis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe the procedural and early outcomes of patients with mechanical mitral valve prosthesis (MVP) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with a novel self-expandable retrievable device.
BACKGROUND: TAVR in patients with prior MVP may have an increased risk of complications related to device positioning and interference between both prosthetic valves.
METHODS: An observational study was conducted, including eight patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis and prior mechanical MVP who underwent TAVR with the novel device AllegraTM (Biosensors). No transesophageal monitoring was used.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 75 years. The mean distance between MVP and aortic annulus was 3.8 mm. Procedural success was achieved in all patients with no major intraprocedural, in-hospital, or follow-up complications.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR with Allegra TAVI system in patients with prior MVP offers good procedural and clinical outcomes.
