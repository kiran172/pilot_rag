Title: Ischemic Stroke in a Seven-Year-Old Female With Down Syndrome and Newly Discovered Moyamoya Syndrome.

Abstract: Moyamoya represents a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disease, characterized by a gradual stenosis of the intracranial internal carotid arteries, thereby increasing the risk of stroke. Down syndrome is known to be a predisposing factor for Moyamoya syndrome. This review discusses a distinctive case of a seven-year-old female with Down syndrome who manifested with Moyamoya syndrome, evident from acute stroke-like symptoms.
