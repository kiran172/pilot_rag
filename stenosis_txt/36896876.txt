Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy and Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty for Severely Calcified Common Femoral Artery Atherosclerotic Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) followed by drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty might be a valuable alternative to surgery for calcified common femoral artery (CFA) atherosclerotic disease. Nonetheless, the 12 months performance of this treatment strategy remains unknown. This study reports on the 12 months outcomes of IVL with adjunctive DCB angioplasty for calcified CFA lesions.
METHODS: This is a retrospective single-center, single-arm study. Consecutive patients treated by IVL and DCB for calcified CFA disease between February 2017 and September 2020 were evaluated. The primary measure outcome of this analysis was primary patency. Procedural technical success (<30% stenosis), freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), secondary patency, and overall mortality were additionally analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-three (n=33) patients were included in this study. The majority presented with lifestyle limiting claudication (n=20, 61%), 52% (n=17) of the patients had chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 33% (n=11) had diabetes. The procedural technical success was 97% (n=32). A flow-limiting dissection post IVL was observed in 2 patients (6%) and a peripheral embolization in a single patient (3%), while the bail-out stenting rate amounted to 12% (n=4). No perforation was observed. The median length of hospital stay was 2 days (interquartile range 2-3). At 12 months, the primary patency was 72%. The freedom from TLR and the secondary patency rates were 94% and 88%, respectively. The 12-month survival amounted to 100% and 75% (n=25) of the patients were asymptomatic or presented with mild claudication. The presence of chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI) (hazard ratio [HR], 0.92; confidence interval (CI); 0.18-4.8, p=0.7) or CKD (HR, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.29-5.8; p=0.72), as well as the use of a 7 mm IVL catheter (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.13-2.63; p=0.49) or of high-dose DCB (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.13-3.53; p=0.65) did not influence the primary patency.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, the combination of IVL and DCB angioplasty for calcified CFA disease was associated with low risk for periprocedural complications, acceptable 12 months clinical outcomes, and low rates of reinterventions.
CLINICAL IMPACT: Intravascular lithotripsy in combination with DCB angioplasty can be an alternative to surgery in highly selected patients with CFA atherosclerotic disease. In this Cohort the combination therapy lead to acceptable clinical results and low reintervention rates at 12 months.
