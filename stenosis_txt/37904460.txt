Title: Neuralgic amyotrophy: sensitivity and specificity of magnetic resonance neurography in diagnosis: A retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Neuralgic amyotrophy (NA) is a clinically acute or subacute disease. To study the characteristics of brachial plexus magnetic resonance neurography (MRN) in patients with NA, and to explore the clinical application value of MRN combined with electromyography (EMG) in the diagnosis of NA.
METHODS: Brachial plexus MRN images of 32 patients with NA were retrospectively analyzed, and their characteristics were investigated. The accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of MRN, EMG, and the combination of the 2 methods for NA diagnosis were compared.
RESULTS: Among the 32 patients with NA, 28 (87.5%) cases of unilateral brachial plexus involvement, 18 (56.3%) cases of multiple nerve roots involvement. In 10 cases, C5 nerve roots were involved alone, and in 9 cases, C5 to C6 nerve roots were involved together. The T2 signal intensity of the affected nerve increased, and 19 cases showed thickened and smooth nerve root edges. Twelve cases showed uneven thickening and segmental stenosis of the involved nerve roots. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of MRN for NA were higher than those of EMG. Combining MRN and EMG could improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis.
CONCLUSION: The main feature of MRN in patients with NA was that it was unilateral brachial plexus asymmetric involvement. The diagnostic effect of MRN was better than that of EMG. The combined diagnosis of MRN and EMG can help clinicians diagnose NA accurately.
