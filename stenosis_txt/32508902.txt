Title: Safety and Efficacy of Flow Reversal in Acute and Elective Carotid Angioplasty and Stenting Using the Mo.Ma Device with Short-Term Follow-Up.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety and efficacy of flow reversal following proximal flow arrest as an embolic protection strategy for carotid angioplasty and stenting (CAS) with short-term follow-up.
METHOD: We performed a retrospective review of our CAS database for patients who underwent stent-supported carotid revascularization in the setting of acute/subacute stroke or TIA. We reviewed clinical and radiographic data during a 36-month period. Primary outcome was clinical evidence of ipsilateral stroke in the first 30 days. Secondary outcomes include clinical outcomes and sonographic and/or angiographic follow-up over 6 months, 6-month functional scale, and all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients underwent CAS using flow reversal: 26 females and 29 males with a mean age of 69.7 years. Median time to treatment from index event was 3 days. 11% underwent stenting as part of hyperacute stroke therapy. Average luminal stenosis was 86%. The 9-Fr Mo.Ma device was used in combination with Penumbra aspiration in all cases. There were no ipsilateral strokes. Incidence of any ischemic event was 3.64%, but only 1 (1.82%) patient had a postoperative stroke. Clinical follow-up was available for 94.5%, while lesion follow-up was available for 73% of patients. Three patients had evidence of restenosis, but none were symptomatic. Luminal restenosis was â‰¤30% in all three. Median pre- and post-NIHSS were 1 and 1, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Flow reversal using the Mo.Ma device is a safe and effective strategy in preventing distal embolization during carotid artery revascularization.
