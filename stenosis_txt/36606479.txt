Title: Variability of blood pressure response to orthostatism and reproducibility of orthostatic hypotension in hospitalized patients with acute ischemic stroke.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Orthostatic hypotension (OH) which diagnosis is based on the measurement of the blood pressure response to orthostatism (BPRO) is a common condition associated with adverse cerebrovascular and cognitive prognosis. It is likely that the single measurement might underestimate the true prevalence of OH. This study investigated the prevalence and reproducibility of the diagnosis of OH and related risk factors in hospitalized acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with multiple measurements.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was a prospective cohort analysis of consecutive AIS patients admitted to the hospital. A total of 211 patients were included. BPRO was assessed five times at the same time on different days.
RESULTS: OH was found in 33 cases (15.6%) in the initial set of measurements of the first day. A cumulative diagnosis of OH after five BPRO tests was found in 75 cases (35.5%). The reproducibility of the diagnosis of OH was mild or poor. In patients with a cumulative diagnosis of OH, 29 (38.7%) patients had orthostatic hypertension (OHTN). In multivariate analysis, the Fazekas scale (odds radio = 1.28, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.04-1.59, P  = 0.023) and extracranial carotid stenosis (≥70%) (odds radio = 3.64, 95% CI, 1.19-11.13, P  = 0.023) were independent risk factors for OH.
CONCLUSION: The reproducibility of OH is poor and the concurrent appearance of OH and OHTN is common in hospitalized AIS patients. Multiple measurements should be taken in hospitalized AIS patients when screening for OH especially patients with higher Fazekas scale and extracranial carotid stenosis (≥70%).
