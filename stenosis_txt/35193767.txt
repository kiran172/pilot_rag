Title: Comparison of Outcomes of Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction Between Chronic Total Occlusion Versus 90-99% Stenosis in Non-Culprit Arteries.

Abstract: Patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) with chronic total occlusion (CTO) in nonculprit arteries had worse prognosis than patients with AMI without CTO in nonculprit arteries. However, the reason was not clearly explained. This retrospective study aimed to compare the clinical outcomes between patients with AMI with CTO versus those with severe stenosis (90% to 99% stenosis) in nonculprit arteries, which would help to elucidate the role of CTO in nonculprit arteries. We included 643 patients with AMI and divided those into the CTO group (n = 188) and 90% to 99% stenosis group (n = 455). The primary end point was the major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as the composite of all-cause death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and readmission for heart failure. During the median follow-up duration of 431 days (Q1:178 days to Q3:950 days), a total of 189 MACE was observed. The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that MACE was more frequently observed in the CTO group than in the 90% to 99% stenosis group (p <0.001). The multivariate Cox hazard analysis revealed that CTO in nonculprit arteries (vs 90% to 99% stenosis) was significantly associated with MACE (hazard ratio 1.410, 95% confidence interval 1.042 to 1.907; p = 0.026) after controlling known confounding factors. In conclusion, patients with AMI with CTO in nonculprit arteries had worse clinical outcomes than those with 90% to 99% stenosis in nonculprit arteries. Patients with AMI with CTO could be recognized as a high-risk group rather than those with 90% to 99% stenosis and should be carefully managed to prevent cardiovascular events.
