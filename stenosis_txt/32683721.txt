Title: Surgical treatment of outflow graft kinking complicated by external obstruction with a fibrin mass in a patient with LVAD.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Outflow graft (OG) obstruction is a dangerous complication that may occur for various reasons after left ventricular assist device (LVAD) implantation.
CASE SUMMARY: We describe the case of a 51-year-old patient on LVAD support who developed significant OG kinking and external OG obstruction due to a fibrin mass causing severe stenosis. Both the OG kinking and external obstruction were eliminated via a left lateral thoracotomy.
