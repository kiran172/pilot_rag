Title: Dual-energy computed tomography-angiography in the evaluation and management of significant multiple pulmonary vein stenoses following atrial fibrillation ablation.

Abstract: A 58-year-old male patient with multi-vessel pulmonary vein (PV) stenosis following atrial fibrillation ablation was referred to a specialized pulmonary hypertension clinic. Chest dual-energy computed tomography (CT)-angiography allowed precise diagnosis of two PVs occlusion and three PVs significant stenosis. Iodine maps showed perfusion deficiency and its value for each stenosis, determining the sequence of multiple PV interventions. We suggest iodine CT mapping is a useful tool in the definition of PV stenosis severity and planning staged angioplasty.
