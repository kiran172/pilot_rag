Title: Long-term clinical follow-up after lung transplantation in patient with scoliosis: a case report.

Abstract: Severe scoliosis causes anatomical distortion of structures in the chest, which raises concerns about donor-recipient size-mismatch in lung transplantation (LT), so that severe scoliosis is considered as an absolute contraindication for LT. Also, postoperative right-side bronchial stenosis is one of the common complications in LT recipients with severe scoliosis. To date, the long-term outcomes in severe scoliosis patients with bronchial stenosis after LT have not been reported. A 14-year-old female patient with scoliosis and interstitial pneumonia underwent bilateral cadaveric LT. Although she developed bronchial stenosis post-LT, necessitating bronchoscopic intervention on three occasions, her lung function and perfusion recovered to the levels recorded prior to development of the obstruction, with the good condition maintained for more than 5Â years after the LT. Therefore, while patients with severe scoliosis are at an elevated risk of postoperative transient bronchial stenosis, scoliosis should not always be considered as a contraindication to LT.
