Title: Added Clinical Value of Intraplaque Neovascularization Detection to Color Doppler Ultrasound for Assessing Ischemic Stroke Risk.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Intraplaque neovascularization, assessed using contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), is associated with ischemic stroke. It remains unclear whether detection of intraplaque neovascularization combined with color Doppler ultrasound (CDUS) provides additional value compared with CDUS alone in assessing ischemic stroke risk. Therefore, we investigated the clinical value of combined CEUS, CDUS, and clinical features for ischemic stroke risk stratification.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We recruited 360 patients with ≥50% carotid stenosis between January 2019 and September 2022. Patients were examined using CDUS and CEUS. Covariates associated with ischemic stroke were identified using multivariate logistic regression analysis. The discrimination and calibration were verified using the C-statistic and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. The incremental value of intraplaque neovascularization in the assessment of ischemic stroke was analyzed using the Delong test.
RESULTS: We analyzed the data of 162 symptomatic and 159 asymptomatic patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria, respectively. Based on multivariate logistic regression analysis, we constructed a nomogram using intraplaque neovascularization, degree of carotid stenosis, plaque hypoechoicity, and smoking status, with a C-statistic of 0.719 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.666-0.768) and a Hosmer-Lemeshow test p value of 0.261. The net reclassification index of the nomogram was 0.249 (95% CI: 0.138-0.359), and the integrated discrimination improvement was 0.053 (95% CI: 0.029-0.079). Adding intraplaque neovascularization to the combination of CDUS and clinical features (0.672; 95% CI: 0.617-0.723) increased the C-statistics (p=0.028).
CONCLUSION: Further assessment of intraplaque neovascularization after CDUS may help more accurately identify patients at risk of ischemic stroke. Combining multiparametric carotid ultrasound and clinical features may help improve the risk stratification of patients with ischemic stroke with ≥50% carotid stenosis.
