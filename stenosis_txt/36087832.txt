Title: Risk factor analysis and treatment outcome of patients with spontaneous isolated celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery dissection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spontaneous isolated mesenteric artery (celiac axis or superior mesenteric artery [SMA]) dissection (IMAD) is a rare clinical entity. The aim of the present study was to examine the patient demographics, comorbidities, clinical and radiologic features, management, and prognosis and to identify the risk factors predictive of symptoms.
METHODS: We performed a single-center, retrospective review from November 2005 to November 2021 of prospectively collected data from patients with a diagnosis of IMAD. The clinical data and radiologic images were reviewed, and statistical analysis was performed to compare the symptomatic and asymptomatic groups.
RESULTS: A total of 78 patients were identified. Of the 78 patients, 24 (31%) had had celiac dissections, 51 (65%) had had SMA dissections, and 3 (4%) had had both celiac and SMA dissections. The mean age was 57.7 years (range, 36-84 years), with a male predominance (86%). More than one half (55%) of the patients had had hypertension. In addition, 29 patients (37%) were symptomatic, and 24 (31%) had been admitted to the hospital. The symptomatic patients with celiac axis dissections were more likely to have thrombosis (P = .02), significant stenosis (P = .01) or branch extension (P = .02). The symptomatic patients with SMA dissections were more likely to have a smaller artery diameter (P = .07), a longer dissection length (P = .05), thrombosis (P < .001), significant stenosis (P < .001), or branch extension (P = .003). The symptomatic patients were more likely to have been treated with antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy (P < .001). Only three patients had undergone an intervention. Seven patients (9%) had died of unrelated causes. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a 5-year survival rate of 96% and 10-year survival rate of 91%.
CONCLUSIONS: IMAD is an uncommon disease entity with a risk of visceral ischemia. Nonetheless, most of these patients can be treated conservatively with medication, with only a small minority requiring emergency surgery.
