Title: Congenital bilateral nasal obstruction in neonate: Case report with review of literature for congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) and differential diagnosis and management.

Abstract: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis is a newly defined clinical entity that causes nasal airway obstruction in neonates due to the narrowing of the pyriform aperture, which is the narrowest and most anterior portion of the nasal airway. As newborns are obligate nasal breathers except when crying, a child with bilateral nasal pyriform aperture obstruction presents as an acute airway emergency, resulting in apnea and cyanosis. This entity should be kept in the differential diagnosis of any neonate or infant presenting with signs and symptoms of upper airway obstruction.
