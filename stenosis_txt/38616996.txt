Title: The crucial relationship between miRNA-27 and CSE/H<sub>2</sub>S, and the mechanism of action of GLP-1 in myocardial hypertrophy.

Abstract: Cardiac hypertrophy is the most prevalent compensatory heart disease that ultimately leads to spontaneous heart failure. Mounting evidence suggests that microRNAs (miRs) and endogenous hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) play a crucial role in the regulation of cardiac hypertrophy. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether inhibition of miR-27a could protect against cardiac hypertrophy by modulating H<sub>2</sub>S signaling. We established a model of cardiac hypertrophy by obtaining hypertrophic tissue from mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction (TAC) and from cells treated with angiotensin-II. Molecular alterations in the myocardium were quantified using quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blotting, and ELISA. Morphological changes were characterized by hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and Masson's trichrome staining. Functional myocardial changes were assessed using echocardiography. Our results demonstrated that miR-27a levels were elevated, while H<sub>2</sub>S levels were reduced in TAC mice and myocardial hypertrophy. Further luciferase and target scan assays confirmed that cystathionine-Î³-lyase (CSE) was a direct target of miR-27a and was negatively regulated by it. Notably, enhancement of H<sub>2</sub>S expression in the heart was observed in mice injected with recombinant adeno-associated virus vector 9 (rAAV9)-anti-miR-27a and in cells transfected with a miR-27a inhibitor during cardiac hypertrophy. However, this effect was abolished by co-transfection with CSE siRNA and the miR-27a inhibitor. Conversely, injecting rAAV9-miR-27a yielded opposite results. Interestingly, our findings demonstrated that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists could mitigate myocardial damage by down-regulating miR-27a and up-regulating CSE. In summary, our study suggests that inhibition of miR-27a holds therapeutic promise for the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy by increasing H<sub>2</sub>S levels. Furthermore, our findings unveil a novel mechanism of GLP-1 agonists involving the miR-27a/H<sub>2</sub>S pathway in the management of cardiac hypertrophy.
