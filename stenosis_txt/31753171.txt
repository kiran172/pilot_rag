Title: Sex Differences in the Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Management of Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: For years, calcific aortic stenosis (AS) was considered to be similar in men and women, and the underrepresentation of women in research studies prevented any alternate conclusions. With new sex-specific studies and data, the landscape of AS is evolving and recently important sex-disparities were revealed. These sex-specific discrepancies are of utmost importance to stratify and personalize treatment according to sex. It is important and urgent to elucidate the sex-related differences and similarities in the pathophysiology of AS to develop and validate sex-specific approaches for the management and pharmacologic treatment of AS, and to improve clinical outcomes for both sexes.
