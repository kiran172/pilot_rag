Title: Synthesis and Optimization of Collagen-targeting Peptide-Glycosaminoglycans for Inhibition of Platelets Following Endothelial Injury.

Abstract: Many endothelial complications, whether from surgical or pathological origins, can result in the denudation of the endothelial layer and the exposure of collagen. Exposure of collagen results in the activation of platelets, leading to thrombotic and inflammatory cascades that ultimately result in vessel stenosis. We have previously reported the use of peptide-GAG compounds to target exposed collagen following endothelial injury. In this paper we optimize the spacer sequence of our collagen binding peptide to increase its conjugation to GAG backbones and increase the peptide-GAG collagen binding affinity by increasing peptide C-terminal cationic charge. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of these molecules to inhibit platelet activation through collagen blocking, as well as their localization to exposed vascular collagen following systemic delivery. Altogether, optimization of peptide sequence and linkage chemistry can allow for increased conjugation and function, having implications for glycoconjugate use in other clinical applications.
