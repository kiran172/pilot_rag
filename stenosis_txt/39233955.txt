Title: Vascular and Neurological Complications in Sphenoid Sinusitis.

Abstract: Although the cavernous sinus and internal carotid artery are in close proximity to the sphenoid sinus, vascular complications in sphenoid sinusitis are rare due to the intervening mucosa and bone. Variations like dehiscence or aggressive infection can cause vascular complications, leading to cavernous sinus thrombosis, while perivascular inflammation of the internal carotid artery can result in stenosis or occlusion. Untreated or aggressive sphenoid sinusitis can cause neurological complications such as cerebral infarcts, meningitis, subdural empyema, cerebral abscess, and cranial nerve injuries. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with angiography can depict these complications at an early stage. Additionally, mastoiditis can cause dural venous sinus thrombosis, which, if left untreated, can result in venous infarcts. We report a case of an 11-year-old male with sphenoid sinusitis who developed a left middle cerebral artery (MCA) territory infarct, cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis, subdural empyema, and meningitis. He also developed left transverse and sigmoid sinus thrombosis due to left mastoiditis.
