Title: SPECT Versus PET Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in Patients with Equivocal CT.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The most pertinent clinical question in post-coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) patients is the assessment of the physiological significance of an anatomically identified stenosis. The clinical application of radionuclide MPI using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) versus positron emission tomography (PET) in the evaluation and management of patients with an inconclusive CCTA is reviewed using a case-based approach.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent evidence suggests that CCTA is the most sensitive non-invasive test to exclude angiographic CAD and may be an effective first-line test especially among symptomatic low-intermediate risk patients. However, in the presence of angiographic atherosclerosis, its specificity and positive predictive value for identifying flow-limiting stenosis are modest. Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging offers accurate quantitative assessment of myocardial ischemia, which helps with risk stratification and patient management especially the potential need for revascularization. Routine accurate quantifications of myocardial blood flow and flow reserve are major advantages of PET MPI, which are especially useful when used in patients at intermediate-high clinical risk.
