Title: Pyloric Mucosal Diaphragm Associated with Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis: An Unusual Combination in a Male Neonate.

Abstract: We describe herein the case of a 3-week-old baby with persistent nonbilious vomiting, due to a hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS) associated with a congenital pyloric mucosal diaphragm. So far, an association between the two conditions has not been described. The diagnosis of a pyloric mucosal diaphragm was delayed because of its cooccurrence with HPS.
