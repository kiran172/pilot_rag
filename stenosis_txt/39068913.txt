Title: Associations between Adipose Tissue-Specific Insulin Resistance and Atherosclerotic Plaques and Burden in Community-Based Population.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aimed to examine the association between adipose tissue-specific insulin resistance and atherosclerotic burden and plaques in intracranial, extracranial, and coronary arteries in community residents without diabetes.
METHODS: Adipose tissue-specific insulin resistance index (Adipo-IR) was calculated by fasting serum insulin and free fatty acids and categorized into 4 groups according to the quartiles. The 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner was used to assess intracranial and extracranial atherosclerotic plaques, while computed tomography angiography was used to assess coronary atherosclerotic plaques. Intracranial, extracranial, and coronary atherosclerotic burden was assessed by segmental stenosis segment scores of the corresponding arterial segments, respectively. Binary and ordinal logistic regression models were utilized to investigate the relationship of Adipo-IR with the presence of atherosclerotic plaques and atherosclerotic burden.
RESULTS: Of 2,719 participants (mean [standard deviation] age, 60.9 [6.6] years; 1,441 [53.0%] women), the prevalence of intracranial atherosclerotic plaques, extracranial atherosclerotic plaques, and coronary plaques were 432 (15.9%), 975 (35.9%), and 1,160 (42.7%), respectively. Compared with individuals with the lowest quartile, participants with the fourth quartile of the Adipo-IR were associated with intracranial atherosclerotic burden (common odds ratio [cOR]: 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.99-1.82), coronary plaque (odds ratio [OR]: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.15-1.83), and segment stenosis score (cOR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.15-1.81) after adjustment for age, sex, and current smoking.
CONCLUSION: Adipose tissue-specific insulin resistance is associated with atherosclerotic burden and plaques in intracranial and coronary arteries in Chinese community nondiabetic residents.
