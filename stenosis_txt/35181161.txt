Title: [Aortic stenosis: An update].

Abstract: Aortic stenosis remains one of the most frequent valvulopathy worldwide, burdened with great mortality and morbidity, and for which there is not yet an effective preventive approach, although the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in its development are better understood nowadays. Its cure, however, has been revolutionized in the last decade by the advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, or TAVI (also named transcatheter aortic valve replacement or TAVR). The technique of TAVI has been refined and its indications has been extended, following the publication of large randomized controlled trials where it was compared to surgical aortic valve replacement with favorable results. Consequently, transfemoral TAVR has become the first line of treatment in case of symptomatic severe aortic valve stenosis. In this review, we describe the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to severe aortic stenosis and the main ongoing randomized controlled trials targeting them. We describe the indication for surgical or percutaneous aortic valve replacement and the main complications following the procedure.
