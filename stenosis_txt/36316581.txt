Title: Lumen-apposing metal stents for the treatment of benign gastrointestinal tract strictures: a single-center experience and proposed treatment algorithm.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lumen-apposing metal stents (LAMS) are an alternative therapeutic option for benign gastrointestinal (GI) tract strictures. Our study aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LAMS for the management of benign GI strictures.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent a LAMS placement for benign luminal GI strictures at a tertiary care center between January 2014 and July 2021 were reviewed. Primary outcomes included technical success, early clinical success, and adverse events (AEs). Other outcomes included rates of stent migration and re-intervention after LAMS removal.
RESULTS: One hundred and nine patients who underwent 128 LAMS placements (67.9% female, mean age of 54.3 ± 14.2 years) were included, and 70.6% of the patients had failed prior endoscopic treatments. The majority of strictures (83.5%) were anastomotic, and the most common stricture site was the gastrojejunal anastomosis (65.9%). Technical success was achieved in 100% of procedures, while early clinical success was achieved in 98.4%. The overall stent-related AE rate was 25%. The migration rate was 27.3% (35/128). Of these, five stents were successfully repositioned endoscopically. The median stent dwell time was 119 days [interquartile range (IQR) 68-189 days], and the median follow-up duration was 668.5 days [IQR: 285.5-1441.5 days]. The re-intervention rate after LAMS removal was 58.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: LAMS is an effective therapeutic option for benign GI strictures, offering high technical and early clinical success. However, the re-intervention rate after LAMS removal was high. In select cases, using LAMS placement as destination therapy with close surveillance is a reasonable option.
