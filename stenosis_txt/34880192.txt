Title: Assessing the Complicated Venous Hemodynamics and Therapeutic Outcomes of Budd-Chiari Syndrome with Respiratory-gated 4D Flow MR Imaging During the Expiratory and Inspiratory Phases.

Abstract: A man in his 50s with Budd-Chiari syndrome diagnosed with the suprahepatic inferior vena cava (IVC) obstruction on CT was assessed using 4D Flow MRI before and after balloon angioplasty. 4D Flow MRI acquired in two respiratory phases, depicted complex hemodynamic and respiratory variability, and a jet stream at the narrowed channel of the membranous IVC. Post-interventional 4D Flow MRI showed that the IVC blood flow increased with corrected flow directions in the infrarenal IVC.
