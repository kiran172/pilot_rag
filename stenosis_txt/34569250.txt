Title: Age and Phenotype of Patients With Plaque Erosion.

Abstract: Background A recent study reported that the outcome of patients with plaque erosion treated with stenting is poor when the underlying plaque is lipid rich. However, the detailed phenotype of patients with plaque erosion, particularly as related to different age groups, has not been systematically studied. Methods and Results Patients with acute coronary syndromes caused by plaque erosion were selected from 2 data sets. Demographic, clinical, angiographic, and optical coherence tomography findings of the culprit lesion were compared between 5 age groups. Among 579 erosion patients, male sex and current smoking were less frequent, and hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were more frequent in older patients. ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction was more frequent in younger patients. Percentage of diameter stenosis on angiogram was greater in older patients. The prevalence of lipid-rich plaque (27.3% in age &lt;45 years and 49.4% in age ≥75 years, P&lt;0.001), cholesterol crystal (3.9% in age &lt;45 years and 21.8% in age ≥75 years, P=0.027), and calcification (5.5% in age &lt;45 years and 54.0% in age ≥75 years, P&lt;0.001) increased with age. After adjusting risk factors, younger patients were associated with the presence of thrombus, and older patients were associated with greater percentage of diameter stenosis and the presence of lipid-rich plaque and calcification. Conclusions The demographic, clinical, angiographic, and plaque phenotypes of patients with plaque erosion distinctly vary depending on age. This may affect the clinical outcome in these patients.
