Title: Associations between Inflammation, Hemoglobin Levels, and Coronary Artery Disease in Non-Albuminuric Subjects with and without Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.

Abstract: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the associations of inflammation and hemoglobin with coronary artery disease (CAD) in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and preserved kidney function. We recruited 638 participants-254 with T2DM-subjected to coronary angiography with no known cardiovascular disease, normal glomerular filtration rates, and without albuminuria. The hemoglobin and serum levels of inflammatory markers, including high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were measured. Multivariable analyses showed that inflammatory markers were not related to the severity of the stenosis in the group of subjects with diabetes. Conversely, inflammatory cytokines and albuminuria were directly related to the percentage of stenosis in subjects without T2DM (R2 = 0.038, p &lt; 0.001). Patients with diabetes presented lower hemoglobin levels, particularly in those who also had significant CAD (14.4 [13.6-15.1] vs. 13.6 [12.2-14.8] g/dL, p = 0.03). Similarly, hemoglobin levels and albuminuria were inversely related to the severity of stenosis exclusively in subjects with diabetes, even after adjusting for multiple confounding factors (R2 = 0.081, p &lt; 0.001). We conclude that reductions in hemoglobin levels in subjects with T2DM and normoalbuminuria may constitute a more relevant risk factor for CAD than inflammation.
