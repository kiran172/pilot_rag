Title: Comparison of Long-Term Outcomes of Patients Having Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement With Versus Without Simultaneous Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting.

Abstract: Coronary artery disease is a common co-morbidity of aortic stenosis. When needed, adding coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is the standard treatment method, but the impact of concomitant CABG on long-term outcomes is uncertain. We compared long-term outcomes of SAVR patients with and without CABG. Hospital survivors aged ≥50 years discharged after SAVR ± CABG in Finland between 2004 and 2014 (n = 6,870) were retrospectively studied using nationwide registries. Propensity score matching (1:1) was used to identify patients with comparable baseline features (n = 2,188 patient pairs, mean age 73 years). The end points were postoperative 10-year major adverse cardiovascular outcome (MACE), all-cause mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and myocardial infarction. Median follow-up was 6 years. Cumulative MACE rate (39.5% vs 35.6%; hazard ratio [HR] 1.04; p = 0.677) and mortality (32.7% vs 31.0%; HR 1.03; p = 0.729) after SAVR were comparable with or without CABG. Myocardial infarction was more common in patients with CABG (13.4% vs 6.9%; HR 1.47; p = 0.0495). Occurrence of stroke (15.1% vs 13.5%; p = 0.998) and major bleeding (20.0% vs 21.9%; p = 0.569) were comparable. There was no difference in gastrointestinal (8.1% vs 10.3%; p = 0.978) or intracranial bleeds (6.0% vs 5.5%; p = 0.794). The use of internal mammary artery in CABG did not have an impact on the results. In conclusion, matched patients with and without concomitant CABG had comparable long-term MACE, mortality, stroke, and major bleeding rates after SAVR. In conclusion, our results indicate that need for concomitant CABG has limited impact on long-term outcomes after initially successful SAVR.
