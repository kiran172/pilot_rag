Title: Endoscopic treatment of extreme esophageal stenosis complicated with esophagotracheal fistula: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: At present, there is no unified and effective treatment for extreme corrosive esophageal stenosis (CES) with esophagotracheal fistula (ETF). This case had extreme and severe esophageal stenosis (ES) and ETF after ingesting an enzyme-based chemical detergent, resulting in a serious pulmonary infection and severe malnutrition. Upper gastrointestinal imaging showed that he had an ETF, and endoscopy showed that he had extreme and severe esophageal stricture. This case was complex and difficult to treat. According to the domestic and foreign literature, there is no universal treatment that is low-risk.
CASE SUMMARY: A patient came to our hospital with extreme ES, an ETF, and severe malnutrition complicated with pulmonary tuberculosis 1 mo after the consumption of an enzyme-based detergent. The ES was serious, and the endoscope was unable to pass through the esophagus. We treated him by endoscopic incision method (EIM), esophageal stent placement (ESP), and endoscopic balloon dilation (EBD) by using the bronchoscope and gastroscope. This treatment not only closed the ETF, but also expanded the esophagus, with minimal trauma, greatly reducing the pain of the patient. According to the literature, there are no similar reported cases.
CONCLUSION: We report, for the first time, a patient with extreme CES complicated with ETF, where the endoscope could not be passed through his esophagus but he could be examined by bronchoscopy and treated by EIM, ESP, and EBD.
