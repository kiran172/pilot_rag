Title: Challenges Faced in Managing an Adult Uncorrected Tetralogy of Fallot Patient with Pneumonia and Septic Shock in the Intensive Care Unit.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. We present a 61-year-old uncorrected TOF patient who presented with sepsis and acute respiratory failure. At presentation, the patient had tachypnea, tachycardia, and oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) 64%. Chest X-ray (CXR) showed bilateral basal opacities. 2D echo revealed left ventricular dysfunction, infundibulum stenosis, pulmonary atresia, overriding of the aorta, and ventricular septal defect. A provisional diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia with septic shock with uncorrected TOF was made. He received empirical antibiotics, ventilatory support, and supportive care. Ventilator weaning was done accepting an arbitrary baseline SpO<sub>2</sub> of 70-75% and lactate-guided volume resuscitation led to a successful outcome. Coronary angiogram showed collaterals. This case report illustrates the dilemmas faced in treating a critically ill uncorrected TOF. To the best of our knowledge, this case could be the oldest surviving uncorrected TOF patient in the Indian population.
