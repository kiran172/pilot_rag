Title: Robotic minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass for Kawasaki disease.

Abstract: Case 1: 17-year-old boy developed severe stenosis at the proximal site of the coronary aneurysm in the left anterior descending artery (LAD). Case 2: 16-year-old boy developed severe stenosis at the proximal site of the coronary aneurysm in the LAD. Case 3: 30-year-old woman developed severe stenosis of the distal portion of the coronary aneurysm in the LAD. Minimally invasive direct coronary artery bypass (MIDCAB) with robot-assisted left internal thoracic artery harvest was successfully performed without cardiopulmonary bypass in these three young patients with Kawasaki disease. This is the first case report of robot-assisted MIDCAB for Kawasaki disease.
