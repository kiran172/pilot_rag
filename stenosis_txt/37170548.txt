Title: Endoscopic rescue of a fistulizing biliary plastic stent.

Abstract: 55-year-old male with a history of cholecystectomy complicated by perforation of the common bile duct, contained with placement of a plastic biliary stent. He presented several subsequent episodes of recurrent cholangitis secondary to biliary lithiasis and residual benign stenosis of the common bile duct, resolved with the implantation of plastic biliary prostheses. Finally, given the recurrent episodes of cholangitis, it was agreed to perform a hepaticojejunostomy. During the operation, the last implanted stent was not detected, which was identified by CT scan of the abdomen, causing a fistulous tract between the duodenum and the ascending colon. The stent was removed endoscopically, without complications, and the fistulous tract was resolved.
