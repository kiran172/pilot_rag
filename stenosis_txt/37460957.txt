Title: Concomitant aortic regurgitation predicts better left ventricular reverse remodeling after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: We aim to determine predictors of inadequate left ventricular mass index (LVMi) regression at mid-term after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), including the potential role of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT).
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients with both echocardiographic assessments and multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) obtained one year after TAVR. The change of LVMi, the volume and the average CT attenuation of EAT from baseline to one-year follow-up was calculated. Patients were divided into two groups by the percentage change of LVMi at a cut-off of 15%.
RESULTS: A total of 152 patients were included with a median age of 74 years (interquartile range [IQR] 69-78 years) and 56.6% being male. LVMi decreased (P < 0.0001) while EAT volume increased and the average CT attenuation decreased (both P < 0.0001) at one year. Baseline atrial fibrillation (P = 0.042), mitral regurgitation ≥ mild (P = 0.006), aortic regurgitation (AR) > mild (P = 0.001) and the change in the average CT attenuation of EAT (P = 0.026) were different between the decrease of LVMi ≥ 15% and < 15%. AR > mild at baseline was the only statistically significant predictor of a decrease of LVMi < 15% at one year (OR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.13 to 0.84, P = 0.021) in multivariate regression.
CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant more-than-mild AR might predict better left ventricular reverse remodeling regression after TAVR.
