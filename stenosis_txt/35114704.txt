Title: Complete Tracheal Ring Deformity, Recurrent Pneumothoraces and Pleuropulmonary Blastoma in a Child: Coincidence or Common Genetic Cause?

Abstract: Complete tracheal ring deformity (CTRD) is a rare abnormality of unknown etiology characterized by circumferentially continuous cartilaginous tracheal rings leading to variable degrees of tracheal stenosis with or without additional heart and lung malformations. Pleuropulmonary blastomas (PPB) are rare malignant mesenchymal tumors, which occur almost exclusively in young children. Pathogenic germline DICER1 variants are associated with PPB but also with other tumors like rhabdomyosarcoma or syndromic diseases like GLOW (Global developmental delay, lung cysts, overgrowth and Wilms tumor) syndrome. Here, we report a case with CTRD and recurrent pneumothoraces who additionally developed PPB on the genetic background of a pathogenic DICER1 variant.
