Title: Reduced Likelihood of Infarction in Crescendo Transient Ischemic Attack Caused by Vasculitic Middle Cerebral Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: A 53-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of increasingly frequent transient speech disturbance and left upper limb weakness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging and angiography revealed multiple intracranial stenoses, including the proximal right middle cerebral artery (MCA), without evidence of infarction. The diagnosis of primary angiitis of the central nervous system was established based on circumferential vascular wall thickening with contrast enhancement observed in the right MCA. Following the administration of dual antiplatelet therapy and intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy, the patient experienced complete cessation of symptoms, and the stenosis gradually improved without infarction. The risk of infarct development in crescendo transient ischemic attacks may differ between inflammatory vascular stenosis and atherosclerosis.
