Title: Endovascular tools for vascular access stenosis: Flow-chart proposal.

Abstract: Stenosis represents the most relevant arteriovenous fistula (AVF) pathology and can affects the entire conduit forming the fistula, from afferent artery to central venous vessels. Correction of vascular access stenosis significantly affects the survival and quality of life for end stage renal disease patients (ESRD) dependent on hemodialysis. Guidelines consider the procedure of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) relevant for the primary treatment of these lesions with excellent results in restoring AVF immediately at the end of the procedure. From first AVF angioplasty in 1981 to now, wide scientific innovation has led to development of new devices, composed by different materials and technologies, specific for the site and the type of stenosis to be treated, able to manage resistant stenotic lesion and to reduce stenosis recurrences. International guidelines do not clearly specify all treatment possibilities in the individual case. In this review the authors want to provide specific information on most used devices for stenosis treatment based on literature evidence, showing when and where to use the various tools available with flow-chart treatment proposal.
