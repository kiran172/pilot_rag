Title: [Chest computed tomography manifestations in neonates with chronic granulomatous disease].

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To study chest computed tomography (CT) manifestations in neonates with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) to provide clues for early diagnosis of this disease.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on the clinical data and chest CT scan results of neonates diagnosed with CGD from January 2015 to December 2022 at Anhui Provincial Children's Hospital.
RESULTS: Nine neonates with CGD were included, with eight presenting respiratory symptoms as the initial sign. Chest CT findings included: consolidation in all 9 cases; nodules in all 9 cases, characterized by multiple, variably sized scattered nodules in both lungs; masses in 4 cases; cavities in 3 cases; abscesses in 6 cases; bronchial stenosis in 2 cases; pleural effusion, interstitial changes, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy each in 1 case. CT enhancement scans showed nodules and masses with uneven or ring-shaped enhancement; no signs of pulmonary emphysema, lung calcification, halo signs, crescent signs, bronchiectasis, or scar lesions were observed. There was no evidence of rib or vertebral bone destruction. Fungal infections were present in 8 of the 9 cases, including 6 with Aspergillus infections; three of these involved mixed infections with Aspergillus, with masses most commonly associated with mixed Aspergillus infections (3/4).
CONCLUSIONS: The primary manifestations of neonatal CGD on chest CT are consolidation, nodules, and/or masses, with Aspergillus as a common pathogen. These features can serve as early diagnostic clues for neonatal CGD.
