Title: Pediatric laryngopharyngeal reflux: Perceptual, acoustic, and laryngeal findings.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Describe acoustic and laryngeal findings in pediatric patients with subjective dysphonia attributed to laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). Determine the impact of LPR on perceived voice quality using the pediatric Voice Handicap Index (pVHI). Compare these findings with age-matched normative values as well as data on pediatric patients with dysphonia due to other etiologies.
METHODS: Retrospective case series of pediatric patients (age 2-17 years) evaluated at a specialty pediatric voice clinic at a tertiary care children's hospital from January 1 2007 to December 31 2017 in whom LPR in whom LPR was deemed to be the most significant contributing factor for dysphonia based on physical examination and history. Patients with structural laryngeal abnormalities unrelated to LPR, such as raised lesions, stenosis, papillomatosis, or vocal fold immobility were excluded.
RESULTS: 163 out of 1195 evaluable patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 87% had pVHI and 83% had acoustic data available from their first appointment for analysis. Mean total pVHI score was 24 (range: 0-81). Perturbation measures were elevated in both females (jitter 1.38%, shimmer 4.16%) and males (jitter 2.01%, shimmer 5.62%). Laryngologic assessment revealed: vocal fold changes including erythema and/or pre-nodules in 72% of patients. Cobblestoning of any portion of the pharynx was present in 67% with hypopharyngeal cobblestoning the most common, present in 64% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with clinically diagnosed LPR have pVHI, jitter, and shimmer scores that are comparable to previously reported patients with raised lesions, scar and immobility, and values that are significantly higher than published normative data. Dysphonic children should be assessed for LPR and treated when indicated.
