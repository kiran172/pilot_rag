Title: Medical and Endovascular Treatments for Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis: A Network Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Medical treatment and endovascular therapy are widely used for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis, but the best treatment strategy remains uncertain. The goal of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of medical treatment, stenting, and primary balloon angioplasty (PBA). We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for trials comparing these three treatments for intracranial stenosis up to December 24, 2020. We performed a network meta-analysis with random-effects models. The primary outcome was any stroke or death during a long-term follow-up. Secondary outcomes included ischemic stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, and death. This network meta-analysis included 14 trials with 1520 participants. No significant difference was found between the three groups in the primary outcome, while PBA was probably the best treatment according to the ranking plot. Medical treatment had significantly lower rate of any stroke or death (odds ratio (OR), 0.31; 95% CI, 0.17-0.56), ischemic stroke (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.23-0.81), and intracranial hemorrhage (OR, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.02-0.71) within 30 days than stenting but did not differ from PBA. The ranking plot demonstrated that PBA was also most likely to rank the highest for ischemic stroke during the long-term follow-up and beyond 30 days, although no significant difference was identified. Medical treatment had lower risk of any stroke or death within 30 days than stenting but did not differ from PBA. All the treatments had similar effects on the prevention of long-term stroke, while PBA had the highest probability of being the most effective.
