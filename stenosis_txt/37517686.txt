Title: Multimodal Analytical Tools to Enhance Mechanistic Understanding of Aortic Valve Calcification.

Abstract: This review focuses on technologies at the core of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) and drug target research advancement, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and molecular imaging. We examine how bulk RNA sequencing and single-cell RNA sequencing have engendered organismal genomes and transcriptomes, promoting the analysis of tissue gene expression profiles and cell subpopulations, respectively. We bring into focus how the field is also largely influenced by increasingly accessible proteome profiling techniques. In unison, global transcriptional and protein expression analyses allow for increased understanding of cellular behavior and pathogenic pathways under pathologic stimuli including stress, inflammation, low-density lipoprotein accumulation, increased calcium and phosphate levels, and vascular injury. We also look at how direct investigation of protein signatures paves the way for identification of targetable pathways for pharmacologic intervention. Here, we note that imaging techniques, once a clinical diagnostic tool for late-stage CAVD, have since been refined to address a clinical need to identify microcalcifications using positron emission tomography/computed tomography and even detect inÂ vivo cellular events indicative of early stage CAVD and map the expression of identified proteins in animal models. Together, these techniques generate a holistic approach to CAVD investigation, with the potential to identify additional novel regulatory pathways.
