Title: Transradial intra-aortic catheter looping in the angioplasty of severe intracranial symptomatic arteriosclerotic diseases.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the effect and feasibility of intra-aortic catheter looping via transradial access in angioplasty for symptomatic intracranial severe (>70%) atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of large arteries (SISOLAs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with SISOLAs who underwent transradial endovascular angioplasty using the catheter looping technique in the ascending aorta were retrospectively enrolled. The clinical data and treatment outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Fifteen patients aged 48-71 years were enrolled in this study. Left vertebrobasilar artery occlusion was present in 1 (6.7%) patient, severe left middle cerebral artery stenosis in 7 (46.7%) patients, severe left internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis of the ophthalmic segment in 4 (26.7%) patients, severe left ICA stenosis of the cavernous segment in 2 (13.3%) patients, and severe right middle cerebral artery stenosis in 2 (13.3%) patients. The arterial stenosis ranged from 70 to 92% (mean 86%) before stenting. The looping of a guiding catheter in the ascending aorta via transradial access for angioplasty was successful in all patients (100%). The vertebral artery intracranial segment occlusion was successfully recanalized, while severe stenosis in the remaining 14 patients was successfully eliminated. After endovascular recanalization, the residual stenosis was reduced by 12-26% (median 18%). No puncture-related complications or surgical-related neurological complications occurred in these patients. In the follow-up angiography conducted on 10 (66.7%) patients after 6-25 months, no in-stent restenosis was detected.
CONCLUSION: Intra-aortic guiding catheter looping via transradial access for endovascular angioplasty of SISOLAs is technically safe, feasible, and effective, especially when the transfemoral artery approach is difficult or impossible to undertake.
