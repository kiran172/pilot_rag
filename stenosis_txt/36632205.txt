Title: Aortic valve leaflet disruption techniques in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: With continued technological advancement and technical improvement of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), it has become a desirable treatment option for aortic valve stenosis. Its minimally invasive approach compared to surgical aortic valve replacement offers the treatment to a broader patient population, mainly non-surgical candidates. A feared complication of TAVR is the occlusion of coronary artery ostium by the native aortic valve leaflet due to its displacement by the expanded transcatheter valve. Bioprosthetic or native aortic scallop intentional laceration to prevent iatrogenic coronary artery obstruction (BASILICA) is a technique developed to mitigate this risk by creating a lengthwise laceration of the left and/or right aortic valve leaflets prior to TAVR. Patient outcomes following TAVR with BASILICA have been promising. Meticulous preoperative examination, patient selection, and hemodynamic management are imperative. With continued refinement, BASILICA may further expand the application of TAVR to patients at high risk for coronary occlusion associated with the procedure.
