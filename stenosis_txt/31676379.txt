Title: Use of a Dual-Filter Embolic Protection Device for Brachiocephalic Artery Stenting.

Abstract: A 77-year-old female with peripheral artery disease underwent brachiocephalic artery stenting for right upper extremity claudication. Given a very high atherosclerotic burden seen on CT, a dual-filter embolic protection device (Sentinel, Boston Scientific) was deployed from the right radial artery to protect the right common carotid and subclavian arteries, and therefore the vertebral artery, during the stenting procedure. This case report demonstrates a novel use of this dual-filter device to provide both carotid and vertebral artery embolic protection during brachiocephalic artery intervention.
