Title: Cerebrospinal fluid protein concentration in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In this study, we examined the impact and degree of lumbar stenosis on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein concentration.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we analyzed protein concentrations in CSF samples of 61 patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) obtained during pre-operative myelography. Patients were divided into two groups: those showing no block to contrast (Group A) versus those showing medium block to contrast below the lumbar puncture level (Group B).
RESULTS: The CSF protein concentration in Group B (104.3 ± 59 g/dL) patients with medium block was significantly greater than that in Group A (65.1 ± 33 g/dL) patients without medium block.
CONCLUSION: A higher average CSF protein concentration was seen in Group B patients with significant lumbar stenosis versus Group A patients without significant lumbar stenosis. Theoretically, damage to the cauda equina in patients with LSS may cause these elevated CSF protein levels.
