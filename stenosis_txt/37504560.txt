Title: An Overview of Sport Participation and Exercise Prescription in Mitral Valve Disease.

Abstract: The incidence of heart valve disease (HVD) has been rising over the last few decades, mainly due to the increasing average age of the general population, and mitral valve (MV) disease is the second most prevalent HVD after calcific aortic stenosis, but MV disease is a heterogeneous group of different pathophysiological diseases. It is widely proven that regular physical activity reduces all-cause mortality rates, and exercise prescription is part of the medical recommendations for patients affected by cardiovascular diseases. However, changes in hemodynamic balance during physical exercise (including the increase in heart rate, preload, or afterload) could favor the progression of the MV disease and potentially trigger major cardiac events. In young patients with HVD, it is therefore important to define criteria for allowing competitive sport or exercise prescription, balancing the positive effects as well as the potential risks. This review focuses on mitral valve disease pathophysiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, exercise prescription, and competitive sport participation selection, and offers an overview of the principal mitral valve diseases with the aim of encouraging physicians to embody exercise in their daily practice when appropriate.
