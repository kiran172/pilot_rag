Title: Effect of Mid-Basilar Artery Angle and Plaque Characteristics on Pontine Infarction in Patients with Basilar Artery Plaque.

Abstract: AIMS: The basilar artery (BA) geometry and plaque characteristics may play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. This study was performed to explore the relationship between the mid-BA angle and plaque characteristics and its effect on pontine infarction using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and three-dimensional time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography.
METHODS: In total, 77 patients with BA plaques were included in this study. According to the presence of acute pontine infarction on diffusion-weighted imaging, the patients were divided into a pontine infarction group and pontine non-infarction group. The mid-BA angle, plaque burden, stenosis ratio, positive remodeling, and intraplaque hemorrhage were evaluated to investigate their effects on stroke.
RESULTS: The pontine infarction group had a greater plaque burden, stenosis ratio, positive remodeling, and mid-BA angle than the pontine non-infarction group. The correlation between the plaque burden and mid-BA angle was the highest (r=0.441, P＜0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the plaque burden (odds ratio, 1.164; 95% confidence interval, 1.093-1.241; P＜0.001) was an independent risk factor for pontine infarction.
CONCLUSION: The mid-BA angle may increase the incidence of pontine infarction by increasing the plaque burden.
