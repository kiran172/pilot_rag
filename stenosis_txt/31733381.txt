Title: Unilateral Versus Bilateral Percutaneous Pedicle Screw Fixation in Oblique Lumbar Interbody Fusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare clinical and radiologic outcomes of unilateral pedicle screw (UPS) and bilateral pedicle screw (BPS) fixations after single-level oblique lateral interbody fusion procedures.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 74 patients receiving single-level oblique lateral interbody fusion at L3-4 or L4-5 (June 2014 to June 2017). These patients were divided into BPS (n = 36) and UPS (n = 38) groups. Perioperative outcomes included operative time, blood loss, medical expenses, and complication rates. Radiologic outcomes included fusion rates and cage subsidence rates. Clinical outcomes included disability measured by the Oswestry Disability Index and pain measured by the visual analog scale.
RESULTS: The operative time was significantly shorter in the UPS group (76.2 ± 4.4 minutes) compared with the BPS group (127.0 ± 5.6 minutes, P < 0.001). There was a significant between-group difference in medical expenses ($11,044.8 ± $470.7 in UPS group vs. $15,018.4 ± $547.1 in BPS, P < 0.001). Blood loss and hospital stay did not differ between groups. Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale scores significantly decreased in both groups at different time points postoperatively compared with preoperatively. The UPS group had lower Oswestry Disability Index and visual analog scale scores than the BPS group at 7 days postoperatively, but no between-group difference was found after 1-month follow-up. Fusion rate was 86.8% in UPS group and 91.7% in BPS group (P > 0.05). Cage subsidence rates did not differ between groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Oblique lateral interbody fusion with UPS fixation is an effective and reliable option for single-level lumbar diseases. Compared with BPS fixation, it resulted in less blood loss, required less operative time, and had comparable effects on radiologic and clinical outcomes.
