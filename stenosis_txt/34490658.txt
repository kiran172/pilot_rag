Title: Ultrasound-guided percutaneous transluminal angioplasty for the treatment of cephalic arch stenosis in hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Cephalic arch stenosis (CAS) is a common cause that leads to the failure of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs). Patients with CAS are primarily treated with fluoroscopy-guided angioplasty. Here, seven patients with de novo cephalic arch stenosis who underwent office-based UG-PTA were.
METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed the total of 321 patients with AVF dysfunction in the nephrology departmnet between July 2017 and October 2018. Among them, seven patients with de novo CAS were included in this study and followed up every 2 months for more than a year.
RESULTS: No significant complications were seen from the operations, and the primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were found to be 100% and 42.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The office-based UG-PTA is probably safe, effective, and feasible in the management of CAS and can be used as a substitute for fluoroscopy-guided PTA.
