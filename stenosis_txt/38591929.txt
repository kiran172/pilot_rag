Title: [Thrombolysis treatment and multi- disciplinary management of central retinal artery occlusion in comparison with traditional ophthalmological treatment options].

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: <p>The management of central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) has long been conservative therapy with limited efficacy carried out in ophthalmology departments together with etiolo&shy;gi&shy;cal investigations lacking a standardised protocol. However, CRAO is analogous to ischemic central nervous system stroke and is associated with increased stroke risk, thus, systemic thrombolysis treatment and multidisciplinary management can be beneficial. Since May 2022, at Semmelweis University CRAO patients diagnosed within 4.5 hours are given intravenous thrombolysis therapy and undergo etiologic workup based on current stroke protocols. Here we report our experience with the multidisciplinary, protocol-based management of CRAO in comparison with former non-protocol based ophthalmological conservative treatment.</p>.
METHODS: <p>We reviewed CRAO patients&rsquo; data treated conservatively and with paracentesis within 6 hours at the Department of Ophthalmology between 2013 and 2022 including changes in visual acuity, neurolo&shy;gical and cardiovascular findings compared to those in the thrombolysis project.&nbsp;</p>.
RESULTS: <p>Of the 78 patients receiving non-protocol care, visual improvement was seen in 37% with natural course, 47% with conservative treatment and 47% with paracentesis. Four patients had significant carotid stenosis (2 underwent endarterectomy), 1 carotid dissection, 6 cardioembolism and 1 giant cell arteritis. Of the 4 patients within 4,5 hours, 3 gave their consent to the clinical trial and were treated with thrombolysis and underwent a full etiological assessment.&nbsp;<br>2 pa&shy;tients had improved visual acuity, 2 pa&shy;tients had significant carotid stenosis and underwent endarterectomy, 1 patient was started on anticoagulation for newly diagnosed atrial fibrillation.</p>.
CONCLUSION: <p>CRAO patients presenting within 4,5 hours are rare and more patients are needed in our study to establish the efficacy of thrombolysis. However uniform protocollized evaluation helps identifying embolic sources thus, avoiding further and potentially more serious thromboembolic events.</p>.
