Title: Successful TAVR for a Patient with Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis and Previous Type A Aortic Dissection.

Abstract: Whether transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) can be accomplished in patients with a bicuspid aortic valve (AV) and previous type A aortic dissection remains rarely addressed. We report such a case in whom transfemoral TAVR was smoothly performed employing an extraordinary long sheath to bypass the dissected aortic segment, yet at the cost of perioperative left temporoparietal infarction owing to no suitable cerebral embolic protection device available in the presence of a remaining dissection in the aortic arch. Thus, for such patients, transfemoral TAVR is still feasible but novel embolic protection devices of distinct designs should be developed to avoid perioperative cerebral embolism.
