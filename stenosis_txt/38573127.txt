Title: Selective Use of CT Fractional Flow at a Large Academic Medical Center: Insights from Clinical Implementation after 1 Year of Practice.

Abstract: Purpose This special report outlines a retrospective observational study of CT fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) analysis using dual-source coronary CT angiography (CTA) scans performed without heart rate control and its impact on clinical outcomes. Materials and Methods All patients who underwent clinically indicated coronary CTA between August 2020 and August 2021 were included in this retrospective observational study. Scans were performed in the late systolic to early diastolic period without heart rate control and analyzed at the interpreting physician's discretion. Demographics, coronary CTA features, and rates of invasive coronary angiography (ICA), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), myocardial infarction, and all-cause death at 3 months were assessed by chart review. Results During the study period, 3098 patients underwent coronary CTA, of whom 113 with coronary bypass grafting were excluded. Of the remaining 2985 patients, 292 (9.7%) were referred for CT-FFR analysis. Two studies (0.7%) were rejected from CT-FFR analysis, and six (2.1%) analyses did not evaluate the lesion of concern. A total of 160 patients (56.3%) had CT-FFR greater than 0.80. Among patients with significant stenosis at coronary CTA, patients who underwent CT-FFR analysis presented with lower rates of ICA (74.5% vs 25.5%, P = .04) and PCI (78.9% vs 21.1%, P = .05). Conclusion CT-FFR was implemented in patients not requiring heart rate control by using dual-source coronary CTA acquisition and showed the potential to decrease rates of ICA and PCI without compromising safety in patients with significant stenosis and an average heart rate of 65 beats per minute.
