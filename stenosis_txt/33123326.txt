Title: The significance of coronary artery calcium score as a predictor of coronary artery stenosis in individuals referred for CT angiography.

Abstract: Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases, including coronary artery disease (CAD), are among the most common causes of death in the elderly population. Recent studies have found that coronary artery calcium score (CACS) is a strong independent predictor of CAD. Here we aimed to investigate the association between CACS and demographic, clinical, laboratory, and CT angiographic findings inpatients with suspected CAD. Methods: From June 2008 to August 2018, we retrospectively reviewed 219 consecutive patients suspected with CAD who were referred for CT angiography in Rajaie Cardiovascular, Medical, and Research Center. Medical records were reviewed, and relevant demographic, clinical, laboratory and imaging were collected. Results: A total of 219 patients with an average age of 62.64Â±12.39 were included. Twelve patients(5.5%) had normal coronary angiography, and 50.2% had mild CAD. An obstructive CAD was found in97 patients (44.3%). The median CACS was 76.4 (IQR, 13.0-289.1). The frequency of obstructive CAD was 28.1% in the CACS &lt;100 group, and 67.0% in CACS &gt;100 group (P &lt; 0.001). On multiple logistic regression analysis, age (OR=1.04 [1.01-1.07], P = 0.006), CACS (OR= 4.31 [2.33-7.98], P &lt; 0.001), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (OR = 0.82 [0.68-0.98], P = 0.027) were independent predictors of obstructive CAD. Conclusion: We found a direct association between higher CACS and obstructive patterns in coronary CT angiography. Our findings indicate that the possibility of the presence of obstructive CAD was higher among symptomatic patients with older age, lower NLR, and CACS &gt;100.
