Title: Left ventricular reverse remodeling and reduction of interstitial fibrosis in patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Left ventricular (LV) structural and functional changes have been reported in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who have undergone transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI); however, the relationship between change in LV structure and systolic function and tissue characteristics assessed via cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) post-TAVI has been not fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate this relationship in patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI and CMRI.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, 65 patients who underwent TAVI and CMRI at the 6-month follow-up were analyzed. The relationship between percent changes in LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), LV ejection fraction (LVEF), and LV mass (LVM) (⊿LVEDV, ⊿LVESV, ⊿LVEF, and ⊿LVM) and those in the native T1 value (⊿native T1) was analyzed using a correlation analysis. Moreover, extracellular volume fraction (ECV) value changes were analyzed.
RESULTS: The ⊿native T1 significantly decreased from 1292.8 (1269.9-1318.4) ms at pre-TAVI to 1282.3 (1262.6-1310.2) ms at the 6-month follow-up (P = 0.022). A significant positive correlation between ⊿LVEDV, ⊿LVESV, and ⊿LVM and ⊿native T1 (r = 0.351, P = 0.004; r = 0.339, P = 0.006; r = 0.261, P = 0.035, respectively) and a tendency toward a negative correlation between ⊿LVEF and ⊿native T1 (r = -0.237, P = 0.058) were observed. The ECV value increased significantly from 26.7 % (25.3-28.3) to 28.2 % (25.7-30.5) (P = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in native T1 might be associated with LV reverse remodeling. Evaluating structural and functional changes using CMRI may be useful for patient management.
