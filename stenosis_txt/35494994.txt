Title: A Better Understanding of Moyamoya in Trisomy 21: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is defined as stenosis of the internal carotid artery or the middle, anterior or posterior cerebral arteries with considerable collateral development. This collateral vessel has a particular appearance in angiographic examinations. Moyamoya syndrome is a term used to describe when moyamoya disease occurs in conjunction with other systemic disorders. One of the associations is Down syndrome. Moyamoya syndrome is very common in patients with Down syndrome, and the cause for this is unknown. The majority of patients present in their first decade, with the clinical presentation varying with age. The cause of moyamoya syndrome in people with trisomy 21 is unknown. This research aimed to learn more about the genesis and pathology of moyamoya syndrome in people with Down syndrome. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were used to conduct this systematic review. Several publications connected to this topic were searched through a comprehensive database search. They were narrowed down to a final number of ten articles after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria and analyzing the quality of each work. Several possibilities were presented in these final papers to explain the link between moyamoya syndrome and trisomy 21. Trisomy 21 patients have a genetic predisposition to vascular problems. The RNF213 gene may interact with the genes on chromosome 21 that influence vascular physiology and elasticity in patients with Down syndrome, resulting in the whole picture of moyamoya syndrome.
