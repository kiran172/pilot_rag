Title: Endoscopic management of adult subglottic stenosis: an alternative to open surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Various surgical techniques could be used to treat subglottic stenosis (SGS). The aim of this study is to present our experience in endoscopic management of SGS and show the impact of symptoms' evaluation, clinical examination and spirometry in the therapeutic decision.
METHODS: Endoscopic treatment was performed in patients referred for SGS and consisted of CO<sub>2</sub> scar lysis associated with balloon dilation and concomitant steroids' injection for patients with grade II or higher on the mMRC (modified Medical Research Council) dyspnea scale associated with a DI (Dyspnea Index) score higher than 10/40 and objective stenosis equal or higher than grade II. The preoperative DI score, EDI (expiratory disproportion index) and voice parameters were compared to postoperative results. The mean interval between endoscopic procedures (IEP) was calculated and we looked for the evolution of the IEP during repeated procedures.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included. 35 dilations were performed. The mean IEP was 86 weeks. There was a significant decrease of the postoperative DI scores by 18.6 points ± 11 (SD). An important difference of 20.1 ± 13.5 (SD) was identified between the pre and postoperative EDI. Minimal changes occured in voice parameters.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoscopic treatment with CO<sub>2</sub> scar lysis associated with balloon dilation and concomitant steroids' injection is a safe, reliable and minimally invasive endoscopic procedure to treat SGS. Decision to treat has to be on an individual basis taking into account subjective symptoms including Dyspnea Index score and objective laryngoscopic findings and spirometry.
