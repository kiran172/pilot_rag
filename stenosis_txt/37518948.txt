Title: Enoxaparin as an Anticoagulant in a Multipara with a Mechanical Mitral Valve: A Case Report.

Abstract: Patients who have undergone mechanical valve replacement require anticoagulation therapy with warfarin to prevent thromboembolism. However, administering warfarin to pregnant patients increases their risk of warfarin embryopathy or central nervous system disorders. Consequently, safer alternatives, such as heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin injection, are substituted for warfarin. However, limited research has been conducted on this subject, with no large-scale studies and particularly few investigations involving multiparous patients. A patient who had previously undergone mechanical mitral valve replacement for atrial septal defect and mitral stenosis received anticoagulant therapy with enoxaparin during 2 pregnancies. Upon confirmation of pregnancy, warfarin was replaced with subcutaneously injected enoxaparin with a dosage of 1 mg/kg at 12-hour intervals. The enoxaparin dosage was controlled using an anti-factor Xa assay, with a target range of 0.3-0.7 IU/mL. Intravenous heparin injections were administered starting 3 days prior to the expected delivery date and were continued until delivery, after which warfarin was resumed. No complications were observed during the deliveries.
