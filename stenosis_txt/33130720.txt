Title: [Severe Calcification on Glutaraldehyde-treated Autologous Pericardium after Mitral Valve Repair by Leaflet Augmentation;Report of a Case].

Abstract: We report a case of surgical treatment of mitral valve stenosis due to severe calcification on the glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium. A 39-year-old woman presented with progressive dyspnea. She had undergone mitral valve repair by leaflet augmentation with a glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium for mitral regurgitation 3 years before. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mitral valve stenosis with limited movement of the anterior leaflet. At redo surgery, severe calcification was observed of the glutaraldehyde-treated autologous pericardium patch on the anterior mitral leaflet. Mitral valve replacement was performed successfully, and she was discharged on postoperative day 14.
