Title: Endoscopic submucosal dissection involving the anal canal presents a risk factor for postoperative stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although postoperative strictures after endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) in the rectum are relatively rare, some rectal lesions require resection involving the anal canal, which is a narrow tract comprising squamous epithelium. To the best of our knowledge, no studies have investigated narrow anal canals when evaluating post-ESD strictures. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of resections involving the anal canal on postoperative stricture development.
METHODS: Between April 2005 and October 2017, 707 rectal lesions were treated with ESD. We retrospectively investigated 102 lesions that required ≥ 75% circumferential resection. Risk factors for post-ESD stricture and, among patients with strictures, obstructive symptoms, and number of dilation therapies required were investigated.
RESULTS: Post-ESD stricture occurred in 18 of 102 patients (17.6%). In the multivariate analysis, circumferential resection ≥ 90% and ESD involving the anal canal (ESD-IAC) were risk factors for postoperative strictures (P ≤ 0.0001 and 0.0115, respectively). Among the patients with strictures, obstructive symptoms were significantly related to anal strictures compared to rectal strictures (100% vs. 27.2%, P = 0.0041). Furthermore, the number of dilation therapies required was significantly greater among patients with anal strictures compared to those with rectal strictures (6.5 times vs. 2.7 times, P = 0.0263).
CONCLUSION: Not only circumferential resection ≥ 90% but also ESD-IAC was a significant risk factor for the stricture after rectal ESD. Furthermore, anal strictures were associated with a significantly higher frequency of obstructive symptoms and larger number of required dilation therapies than were rectal strictures.
