Title: Carcinoid heart findings in vasoactive intestinal peptide-secreting tumour.

Abstract: Tricuspid valve disease in carcinoid heart syndrome is usually diagnosed via screening echocardiography in patients with known carcinoid syndrome. Vasoactive intestinal peptide tumour (VIPoma) is a rare tumour with an incidence of 0.05%-2%â€‰that typically presents with symptoms related to the release of vasoactive intestinal peptide: flushing, diarrhoea and electrolyte abnormalities like hypokalaemia and hypochlorhydria. Historically, the cardiac valves are unaffected. We present a case where a finding of tricuspid regurgitation and stenosis on echocardiography prompted an expedited workup for malignancy ultimately leading to a diagnosis of VIPoma.
