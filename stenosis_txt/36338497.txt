Title: 4'-phosphopantetheine acts as a potential antioxidant to limit atherosclerotic plaque formation by inhibiting ROS generation.

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) is caused by coronary atherosclerosis and has a high morbidity and mortality rate worldwide. There are challenges in both early screening and treatment of CHD. The appearance and development of CHD is a complex metabolic disorder process. Therefore, to search for new biomarkers of CHD, we analyzed the peripheral blood metabolome in patients with CHD. In the study, a plasma metabolite, 4'-Phosphopantetheine (4-PPanSH), which was discovered by HPLC-MS/MS, as peripheral blood 4-PPanSH decreases, the degree of coronary blockage gradually aggravates. In addition, the 4-PPanSH supplement limited atherosclerotic plaque formation and endothelial injury in mice. Further, in vascular endothelial cells, 4-PPanSH effectively inhibited ROS generation and ox-LDL accumulation. In summary, 4-PPanSH was associated with the degree of coronary stenosis, and the 4-PPanSH supplement reduced atherosclerotic plaque generation, which could be associated with 4-PPanSH acting as a potent antioxidant that inhibits ROS generation and alleviates vascular endothelial injury.
