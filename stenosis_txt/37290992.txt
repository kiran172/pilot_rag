Title: Hybrid repair of left ventricle pseudoaneurysm utilizing a transapical and transseptal approach.

Abstract: Mitral valve endocarditis complicated by peri-mitral annular destruction requires surgical intervention. We present a case where surgery was not an option. A 45-year-old man who developed an enlarging left ventricle pseudoaneurysm, left ventricle to left atrium fistula and red blood cell hemolysis as sequalae of mitral valve endocarditis was not a surgical candidate. Patient underwent a hybrid repair of left ventricle pseudoaneurysm via a transapical and transseptal approach. The body of pseudoaneurysm was coiled trans-apically whereas the neck of pseudoaneurysm was reached and coiled via a transseptal approach. The left ventricle to left atrium fistula was closed via an Amplatz muscular ventricle septal occluder. The pseudoaneurysm was fully obliterated, patient symptoms improved and was discharged with stable hemoglobin levels.
