Title: Is "moderate" aortic stenosis still the right name? A review of the literature.

Abstract: Current guidelines recommend aortic valve replacement for symptomatic or selected asymptomatic high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis. Conversely, a watchful waiting attitude applies to patients with moderate aortic stenosis, regardless of their risk profile and symptoms, until the echocardiographic thresholds of severe aortic stenosis are reached. This strategy is based on data reporting high mortality in untreated severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, whereas moderate aortic stenosis has always been perceived as a non-threatening condition, with a benefit-risk balance against surgery. Meanwhile, numerous studies have reported a worrying event rate in these patients, surgical techniques and outcomes have improved significantly and the use of transcatheter aortic valve replacement has become more widespread and extended to lower-risk patients, leaving this strategy open to question, especially for patients with moderate aortic stenosis and left ventricular dysfunction. In this review, we summarize the current state of knowledge about moderate aortic stenosis progression and prognosis. We also discuss the particular case of moderate aortic stenosis associated with left ventricular dysfunction, and the ongoing trials that that might change our paradigm for the management of this "moderate" valvular heart disease.
