Title: Unilateral biportal endoscopic spine surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Lumbar spinal stenosis is the most common spinal degenerative disease in patients over 60 years, and the unilateral biportal endoscopic (UBE) spine surgery treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) has achieved preliminary clinical results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to reveal the clinical efficacy of UBE for LSS and provide evidence for clinical practice.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were searched for literature. The papers selected were those published from inception till October 2021. The selected pieces of literature were graded for evidence using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine: Levels of Evidence (March 2009). Outcomes measures were operation time, blood loss, complication rate, admission period, Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)-back, VAS-leg, and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score, and radiological outcomes. The mean comparisons were based on VAS and ODI scores.
RESULTS: A total of 823 patients with a single LSS segment were included from the selected nine studies. There were nine studies comparing UBE clinical outcomes and micro-endoscopic unilateral laminotomy for bilateral decompression (M-ULBD). The meta-analysis revealed that the UBE group had better VAS-leg and -back scores in the first week postoperatively [total: mean difference (MD) = -0.96, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.19, -0.74, p < 0.00001; total: MD = -1.69, 95% CI: -1.93, -1.45, p < 0.00001], 1st month postoperatively (total: MD = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.61, -0.08, p = 0.01; total: MD = -0.40, 95% CI: -0.68, -0.12, p = 0.005), 6th month postoperatively (total: MD = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.35, -0.08, p = 0.002; total: MD = -0.24, 95% CI: -0.40, -0.07, p = 0.005), and UBE group also performed better in ODI score at 1st month postoperatively (total: MD = -3.36, 95% CI: -4.26, -2.46, p < 0.00001). There was no significant difference in VAS-leg and -back scores between both groups at the 3rd and 12th month postoperatively, and ODI scores did not significantly differ between both groups at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively (all p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: UBE has achieved good preliminary clinical results and may be a minimally invasive alternative surgery for patients with single segmental LSS.
