Title: Extensive small intestinal diffuse large B cell lymphoma.

Abstract: A 32-year-old man was referred to us for further therapy of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. He had suffered from abdominal pain due to perforation of small intestine 1 month ago and had received partial small bowel resection. Pathological examination of tissue obtained by means of partial small bowel resection indicated diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Abdominal CT showed prominent diffuse small intestinal wall thickening and lumen stenosis (blue arrows). Multiple enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were also demonstrated. The abdominal cavity volume was relatively full with bladder compression. The patient underwent rituximab chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. Repeat abdominal CT 5 months later showed marked improvement, with position of bilateral abdominal wall and bladder returned to normal. He was feeling well at 6 months of follow-up.
