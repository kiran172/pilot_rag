Title: Use of transcarotid artery revascularization for mechanical thrombectomy and treatment of symptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis associated with free-floating thrombus: illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with symptomatic high-grade stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) associated with a free-floating thrombus (FFT) present a significant clinical challenge. In general, for patients with moderate to severe symptomatic ICA stenosis, carotid revascularization is recommended within 2 weeks of symptom onset; however, some physicians suggest that revascularization should be delayed in cases with FFT because some data suggest that early surgery with carotid endarterectomy or carotid stent poses a higher risk for stroke. Likewise, delayed revascularization with anticoagulation may increase risk of recurrent stroke. Few reports on the management of FTT included the use of a transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) approach for carotid revascularization with mechanical aspiration thrombectomy.
OBSERVATIONS: This report described the use of TCAR for direct mechanical thrombectomy and carotid stent placement for a patient with 80% right ICA stenosis along with a large FFT extending into the bulb and the external carotid artery.
LESSONS: The TCAR approach for mechanical thrombectomy and carotid stenting is a safe alternative for early revascularization with low periprocedural stroke risks.
