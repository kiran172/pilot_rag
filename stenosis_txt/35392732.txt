Title: The effectiveness of enterprise stent use on the treatment of intracranial atherosclerosis disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To examine the clinical outcome of Enterprise stent in patients with severe and symptomatic intracranial atherosclerosis.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: Twenty-five patients who underwent Enterprise stenting between January 2012 and March 2019 were included in this study. Exclusion criteria were previous intracranial stenting and inadequate follow-up. Technical success rates of the procedures were recorded. Clinical outcome was evaluated with pre- and post-treatment modified Rankin Scale scores. The patients were monitored for 18 months clinically and for 14.3 months radiologically.
RESULTS: The mean age of the 15 males and 10 females was 61.6 ± 8.19. Of these 25 patients, 6 (24%) were in the anterior system and 19 (76%) were in posterior system. The mean degree of pre-treatment stenosis was 86.4% ± 7 with the mean lesion length of 12.5 ± 7.5 mm. The residual stenosis rate was 23.8% ± 8.81. Technical success rate was 100%. There were two major complications within the first 30 days (8%). Late major complications (after 30 days) occurred in one case (4%). Stent restenosis was detected in two patients (8%). No intracranial bleeding or mortality was observed.
CONCLUSION: In this single-center study, we achieved high technical success and tolerable complication rates. Enterprise stent may be a good treatment alternative for severe intracranial stenosis especially in patients resistant to medical treatment when correct patient selection is made. However, further randomized controlled studies, including more cases should be carried out.
