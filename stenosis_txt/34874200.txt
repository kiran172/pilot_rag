Title: Myocardial Late Contrast Enhancement CT in Troponin-Positive Acute Chest Pain Syndrome.

Abstract: Background Acute chest pain with mild troponin rise and inconclusive diagnosis after clinical evaluation represents a diagnostic challenge. Triple-rule-out (TRO) CT may exclude coronary artery disease (CAD), as well as acute aortic syndrome and pulmonary embolism, but cannot help identify other causes of myocardial injury. Purpose To investigate the diagnostic value of a comprehensive CT protocol including both an angiographic and a late contrast enhancement (LCE) scan in participants with troponin-positive acute chest pain. Materials and Methods In this prospective study, consecutive patients with troponin-positive acute chest pain or anginal equivalent and inconclusive diagnosis after clinical evaluation (symptoms, markers, electrocardiography, and echocardiography) who underwent TRO CT between June 2018 and September 2020 were enrolled. TRO CT was performed to evaluate the presence of obstructive CAD (stenosis ≥50%), acute aortic syndrome, and pulmonary embolism. If the findings on the TRO CT scan were negative, an LCE CT scan was acquired after 10 minutes to assess the presence and pattern of scar and quantify the myocardial extracellular volume fraction. CT-based diagnoses were compared with diagnoses obtained with reference standard methods, including invasive coronary angiography, cardiac MRI, and endomyocardial biopsy. Results Eighty-four patients (median age, 69 years [interquartile range, 50-77 years]; 45 men) were enrolled. TRO CT helped identify obstructive CAD in 35 participants (42%), acute aortic syndrome in one (1.2%), and pulmonary embolism in six (7.1%). LCE CT scans were acquired in the remaining 42 participants. The following diagnoses were reached with use of LCE CT: myocarditis (22 of 42 participants [52%]), takotsubo cardiomyopathy (four of 42 [10%]), amyloidosis (three of 42 [7.1%]), myocardial infarction with nonobstructed coronary arteries (three of 42 [7.1%]), dilated cardiomyopathy (two of 42 [4.8%]), and negative or inconclusive findings (eight of 42 [19%]). The addition of LCE CT improved the diagnostic rate of TRO CT from 42 of 84 participants (50% [95% CI: 38.9, 61.1]) to 76 of 84 (90% [95% CI: 82.1, 95.8]) (P &lt; .001). Conclusion A CT protocol including triple-rule-out and late contrast enhancement CT scans improved diagnostic rate in participants presenting with acute chest pain syndrome. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
