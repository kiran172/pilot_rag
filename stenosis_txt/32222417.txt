Title: Procedural Complications and Factors Influencing Immediate Angiographic Results after Endovascular Treatment of Small (<5 mm) Ruptured Intracranial Aneurysms.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: There are technical challenges to complete occlusion of small (<5 mm) ruptured intracranial aneurysms (SRAs) using endovascular treatment (EVT). This study analyzed factors influencing immediate angiographic results in SRAs after EVT.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Intraoperative angiograms and medical records of 290 patients, who underwent EVT for SRAs at 2 stroke centers in China between January 2009 and October 2016, were retrospectively reviewed and evaluated.
RESULTS: Immediate complete occlusion was achieved in 213 (73.4%) aneurysms. Aneurysms with a smaller aspect ratio, those less than 3 mm in size, irregular shape, small basal outpouching, multiple aneurysms, poorer Hunt and Hess grade, and location of communication arteries demonstrated higher rates of incomplete occlusion, although the differences were not statistically significant. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that SRAs with parent artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50% and lobulation demonstrated a higher incidence of incomplete occlusion. Intra-procedural rupture occurred in 13 (6.1%) patients in the complete occlusion group, and 3 (3.9%) in the incomplete occlusion group (P = .467). Thromboembolic complications occurred in 3 (1.0%) patients, and 4 (1.9%) underwent decompressive craniotomy after EVT, all of whom were in the complete occlusion group. Nine (4.2%) patients in the complete occlusion group and 2 (2.6%) in the incomplete occlusion group (P = .733) experienced intraprocedural vasospasm, with corresponding morbidity and mortality rates of 15.0% and 2.1%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Proximal parent artery stenosis greater than or equal to 50% and lobulation were independent predictors of incomplete occlusion in patients with SRAs. Higher rates of intraprocedural rupture, thromboembolic complications, intraprocedural vasospasm, and mortality were found in the complete occlusion group; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Complete occlusion of SRAs may be achieved without additional mortality and perioperative complications.
