Title: CARINAL RECONSTRUCTION FOR LUNG CANCER AND AIRWAY TUMORS: LONG-TERM RESULTS.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Resection and reconstruction of the carina infiltrated by NSCLC or airway tumor is a technically demanding operation allowing oncologic radical treatment. Hereby we report the results of a 20-year experience from a high-volume center.
METHODS: Forty-one patients underwent carinal resection for NSCLC (n=32) or primary airway tumor (n=9). Right tracheal-sleeve pneumonectomy was performed in 19 patients, left tracheal-sleeve pneumonectomy in 6, isolated carinal resection in 4 and right tracheal-sleeve upper lobectomy in 12. In 8 patients Superior Vena Cava replacement was associated. Extra-Corporeal-Membrane-Oxygenation was used in 4 patients undergoing isolated carinal reconstruction. Nine patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
RESULTS: Complete resection (R0) was achieved in 97.5% of patients. Postoperative 30-day mortality was 7.3%(n=3). The major complication rate was 24.3%(n= 10). Airway complications were 7 (2 anastomotic fistula, 5 anastomotic stenosis requiring dilatation and stenting); other major complications included 1 esophageal-pleural fistula, 1 pneumonia and 1 pulmonary edema. Among the 32 NSCLC patients, 26 were pathologic stage III and 6 pathologic stage II. The recurrence rate was 34.2%(n=13); it was 41.3%(n=12) in NSCLC and 11.1% (n=1) in airway tumors. Three and 5-year Overall Survival (Kaplan-Meier) was 56.1% (NSCLC:50.8%;Airway:76.2%) and 50.5% (NSCLC:44.5%;Airway:76.2%), respectively. Disease-Free Survival was 61.7% (NSCLC:55.2%;Airway:85.7%) at 3 years and 55.5% (NSCLC:48.3%;Airway:85.7%) at 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Carinal reconstruction for lung and airway tumors resection is a complex, oncologically reliable procedure allowing good long-term results in adequately selected patients. Wherever possible, these operations should include parenchymal sparing techniques allowing to spare healthy lung tissue without compromising the radicality of resection.
