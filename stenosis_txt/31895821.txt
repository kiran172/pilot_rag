Title: Fluoroscopic removal of self-expandable metallic airway stent in patients with airway stenosis.

Abstract: To study the safety and efficacy of fluoroscopic removal of self-expandable metallic stent for airway stenosis.We conducted a retrospective analysis of 67 consecutive patients, 39 male and 28 female, who underwent fluoroscopic stent removal from March 2011 to April 2017. The patients ranged in age from 12 to 85 years. Seventy-six airway stents were implanted, 70 covered stents and 6 bare stents, including 9 stents for second stent implantation after removal. All patients underwent chest computed tomography scans with/without bronchoscopy before stent removal. The indication of stent removal and postinterventional complications were analyzed retrospectively.Seventy-four of 76 airway stents were successfully removed, only 2 stent showed retained struts after removal, for a technical success rate of 97.4%. Two patients died of complications (1 hemorrhage and 1 respiratory failure), resulting in a clinical success rate of 94.7%. Five stents showed strut fracture and the remaining 71 stents were removed in 1 piece. Indications for stent removal include planned removal (n = 40), excessive granulation tissue (n = 15), intolerance of stenting (n = 6), inadequate expansion and deformation (n = 5), stent migration (n = 5), replacement of bare stent (n = 4), and strut fracture (n = 1). There were 17 complications of stent removal: death from massive bleeding (n = 1), restenosis requires stenting (n = 9), strut fracture or residue (n = 5), dyspnea requires mechanical ventilation (n = 2). The survival rates were 83.8%, 82.1%, and 82.1% for 0.5, 3, and 6 years.Fluoroscopic removal of airway stent is technically feasible and effective. Stents are recommended for removal within 3 months for treating airway stenosis.
