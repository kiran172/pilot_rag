Title: Ureteral stents: the good the bad and the ugly.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Ureteral stents are necessary in the routine practice of an urologist. Choosing the correct stent and being aware of the options available will allow urologists to provide the best possible care for patients and value to the healthcare system. This review seeks to educate urologists regarding improvements in stent technology currently available or in development.
RECENT FINDINGS: Research from around the world is underway to discover an ideal stent - one that is comfortable for patients, resists infection and encrustation and is affordable for hospital systems. Stent design alterations and stent coatings are revealing reductions in encrustation and bacterial colonization. Biodegradable stents and magnetic stents are being tested to prevent the discomfort of cystoscopic removal. Intraureteral stents are proving efficacious while eliminating an irritating coil from the bladder and the symptoms associated with it.
SUMMARY: The studies highlighted in this review provide encouraging results in the pursuit of the ideal stent while opening discussion around new concepts and further areas of research.
