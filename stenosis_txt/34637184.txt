Title: Pulmonary ductal coarctation: An entity associated with congenital heart defects involving the right ventricle outflow tract.

Abstract: We present a case of a prematurely born 2-month-old girl with a double outlet right ventricle with pulmonary atresia and a left pulmonary artery coarctation arising after ductal closure. The case highlights the importance of knowledge and identification of such an anomaly in patients with congenital heart malformations with severe pulmonary stenosis to atresia.
