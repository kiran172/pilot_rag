Title: Mortality prediction of the frailty syndrome in patients with severe mitral regurgitation.

Abstract: In this prospective observational study, we investigated the impact of geriatric syndromes and frailty on mortality and evaluated the prognostic value of different frailty, nutritional, and geriatric assessment tools in high-risk patients with severe mitral valve regurgitation (MR) who were evaluated for mitral valve therapies including surgical, interventional, and conservative treatment options. We prospectively assessed multiple parameters including the CONUT Score, the Katz Index of independence in activities of daily living (ADL), the Fried Frailty Phenotype (FFP), and the Essential Frailty Toolset (EFT) Score in 127 patients with severe symptomatic MR requiring surgical/interventional treatment versus conservative monitoring. We compared their predictive value on mortality including multivariate regression analysis to identify the most suitable tool to predict outcomes in these patient groups. The frailty syndrome as assessed with the CONUT Score, Katz Index, EFT Score, and FFP was associated with higher rates of comorbidities, significantly higher risk scores such as logistic EuroSCORE, EuroSCORE II, and STS-PROM, and significantly higher mortality rates. The EFT Score and FFP were independent predictors of one-year all-cause mortality in our study cohort (EFT Score: HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.2; p = 0.01; FFP: HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.1; p = 0.015). Geriatric syndromes and frailty are associated with increased mortality in high-risk patients with symptomatic severe MR. The EFT Score and the FFP were independent predictors of one-year all-cause mortality.
