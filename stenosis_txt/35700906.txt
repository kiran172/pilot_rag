Title: Staged Versus Synchronous Carotid Endarterectomy and Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting: A Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are several treatment options for patients with concomitant carotid and coronary artery disease, and it is difficult to identify an optimal treatment strategy that has consensus. Here, we performed a meta-analysis to compare the early and long-term outcomes of staged and synchronous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting approaches.
METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis that compared staged and synchronous carotid endarterectomy and coronary artery bypass grafting approaches between July 1976 and September 2021. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for related articles.
RESULTS: Nineteen studies were identified with a total of 39,269 and 30,066 patients in the synchronous and staged groups, respectively. Early mortality was lower in the staged group than in the synchronous group (odds ratio OR 1.256, 95% confidence interval CI 1.006-1.569, P= P &lt; 0.05, I2 = 54.5%), and stroke rates were significantly higher in the synchronous group (OR 1.356, 95% CI 1.232-1.493, P &lt; 0.05, I2 = 33.3%). The rate of myocardial ischemia was significantly higher in the staged group than in the synchronous group (OR 0.757, 95% CI 0.635-0.903, P &lt; 0.05, I2 = 51.5%), and this meta-analysis also showed a significantly higher risk of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) in the synchronous group (OR 1.335, 95% CI 1.055-1.688, P &lt; 0.05, I2 = 0.00%). The secondary outcomes, including the rate of reoperation, were significantly lower for the staged procedure than for the synchronous procedure (OR 1.177, 95% CI 1.052-1.318, P &lt; 0.05, I2 = 4.2%), and the rate of wound infection was significantly higher in the synchronous group than in the staged group (OR 0.457, 95% CI 0.403-0.519, P &lt; 0.05, I2 = 0.0%). There was no significant difference in the rate of cardiac arrhythmia between the two groups (OR 0.544, 95% CI 0.265-1.117, P &gt; 0.05, I2 = 12.7%). There was also no statistical significance in the long-term results regarding the incidence of stroke, myocardial ischemia, and mortality between the synchronous and staged groups (P &gt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated with the synchronous approach had a significantly higher risk of early mortality, stroke, TIA, wound infection, and reoperation and a lower risk of myocardial ischemia than those treated with the staged approach. There was no significant difference in the long-term results between the 2 groups.
