Title: Successful prevention of stenosis after circumferential endoscopic resection of esophageal cancer.

Abstract: Circumferential resection of a >5-cm longitudinal mucosal defect following esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is a risk factor for refractory stenosis. Circumferential ESD was performed in 3 patients with 64, 69, and 70 mm longitudinal mucosal defects. A local steroid injection was used to treat the postoperative ulcer, followed by an oral steroid. In all three cases, the ulcer healed without the need for endoscopic dilation. A combination of local injection and oral steroids effectively prevented esophageal stenosis in patients with high-risk stenosis after ESD.
