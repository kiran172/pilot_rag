Title: Paclitaxel-Loaded PLGA Coating Stents in the Treatment of Benign Cicatrical Airway Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway stent implantation used in the treatment of benign cicatricial airway stenosis (BCAS) can lead to local granulation and scar formation, resulting in restenosis and treatment failure.
METHODS: We systematically investigated a paclitaxel-loaded PLGA-coating stent (PLPCS) and analyzed the safety and efficacy of the PLPCS in patients with BCAS. Patients were enrolled from four hospitals in China and observed for six months after implantation, by bronchoscopy performed weekly in the first month and monthly thereafter. The stent was removed immediately upon detection of granulation tissue proliferation, leading to immobility of the stent.
RESULTS: Granulation tissue was formed one week after stent implantation, most of which was located at the upper edge of the stent and the narrowest airway in the stent. All stents were removed in three months (mean: 6.51 + 4.67 weeks), with a curative outcome in one case and ineffective results in two. The remaining seven patients developed complications within three months, necessitating early stent removal. The main complication was granulation formation, resulting in difficulty in stent removal.
CONCLUSION: Although PLPCS showed beneficial effects in basic and animal experiments, it cannot prevent airway restenosis in actual practice, mainly due to granulation formation.
