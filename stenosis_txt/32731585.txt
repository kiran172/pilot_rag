Title: Patient Management in Aortic Stenosis: Towards Precision Medicine Through Protein Analysis, Imaging and Diagnostic Tests.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular disease in developed countries. It progresses from mild fibrocalcific leaflet changes to a more severe leaflet calcification at the end stages of the disease. Unfortunately, symptoms of aortic stenosis are unspecific and only appear when it is too late, complicating patients' management. The global impact of aortic stenosis is increasing due to the growing elderly population. The disease supposes a great challenge because of the multiple comorbidities of these patients. Nowadays, the only effective treatment is valve replacement, which has a high cost in both social and economic terms. For that reason, it is crucial to find potential diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic indicators that could help us to detect this disease in its earliest stages. In this article, we comprehensively review several key observations and translational studies related to protein markers that are promising for being implemented in the clinical field as well as a discussion about the role of precision medicine in aortic stenosis.
