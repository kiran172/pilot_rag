Title: Angiographic Characteristics of Hemorrhagic and Ischemic Phases of Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to assess the evolution of imaging patterns over time in patients with neurological complications caused by reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome.
METHODS: A total of 24 consecutive patients with reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome presenting between 2009 and 2016 were included, whose disease course was complicated by intracranial hemorrhage and/or ischemic events. In total 55 angiographic studies were carried out. The nature of the intracranial complication and location of vasoconstriction on the angiograms in relation to the time interval since symptom-onset were assessed.
RESULTS: Complications included subarachnoid hemorrhage (n = 19, 79%), intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 7, 29%), ischemic stroke (n = 6, 25%), and transient ischemic attack (n = 4, 17%). Hemorrhagic complications mainly occurred within 7 days after symptom onset (18/19 patients, 95%), whereas ischemic events only occurred after the first week (10/10 patients, 100%, p < 0.00001). Distal vasospasm was predominantly observed within 7 days (26/28 angiograms, 93%) and proximal vasospasm ≥7 days (23/27 angiograms, 85%, p < 0.00001).
CONCLUSION: In reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome causing neurological complications, an early hemorrhagic phase with distal vasospasm and a delayed ischemic phase with proximal vasospasm can be discriminated.
