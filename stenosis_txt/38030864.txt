Title: Valvulotomy of the great saphenous vein in ex situ non-reversed and in situ setting: a multicenter post-market study to assess the safety and efficacy of the AndraValvulotome™".

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and technical success of the AndraValvulotome™ device (Andramed GmbH, Reutlingen, Germany) in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD) requiring bypass surgery using the great saphenous vein (GSV) as graft.
METHODS: This was a multicenter, post-market observational study conducted in 2021 in 11 German centers. Safety and efficacy data were prospectively collected and analyzed. Primary endpoints were the absence of device-related serious adverse events until 30 ± 7 days follow-up, the clinical efficacy of valvulotomy, which was defined as pulsatile blood flow in the bypass and the number of insufficiently destroyed vein valves. Secondary endpoints were the number of valvulotomy passages, the primary patency rate of the venous bypass (determined by a color-duplex sonography showing a normal blood flow through the bypass and absence of stenosis or occlusion), and the primary technical success defined as the absence of product-specific (serious) adverse events and clinical efficacy.
RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled. The mean age of the patients was 71 years (46-91), and 74.6% were males. The vein material used for bypass grafting had a median length of 47.5 cm (range 20-70 cm) with a median diameter of 5.0 mm (range 3-6 mm) and 4.0 mm (range 2-6 mm) in the proximal and distal segments, respectively. The technical success rate was 96.6%. The primary patency rate was 89.9% at 30 days follow-up. The clinical efficacy was rated as very good in 81% of patients, fair in 17%, and poor in 2%. Between 1 and 5 (average 2.9) valvulotome passages were performed. One product-related serious adverse event was recorded (bypass vein dissection).
CONCLUSION: The AndraValvulotome™ can be considered a safe and effective device to disrupt venous valves during in situ non-reversed bypass surgeries using GSV grafts in patients with PAD.
