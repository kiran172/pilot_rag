Title: Floralozone Ameliorated Atherosclerosis in Experimental Atherosclerotic Rats Involved with Sphingosine 1-Phosphate 1 Enhancement.

Abstract: Atherosclerosis (AS) is a chronical pathological process of the arterial narrows due to the AS plaque formation. The aim of this study was to explore the therapeutic effect and the underlying mechanism of Floralozone on experimental atherosclerotic model rats. Experimental atherosclerotic model rats were induced by the right carotid artery balloon injury and intraperitoneal injection of vitamin D3 in rats after 4Â weeks high-fat diet. The results exhibited that Floralozone could ameliorate vascular injury and vasorelaxation of descending aortas and increase the superoxide dismutase activity and the expression of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) 1 and reduce the intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 level, and the malondialdehyde activity in experimental atherosclerotic rats. However, Fingolimod, an S1P1 inhibitor, could reverse these Floralozone effects in experimental atherosclerotic rats. Our results indicated that Floralozone could inhibit the atherosclerotic plaque formation and improves arterial stenosis and reduces endothelial dysfunction in experimental atherosclerotic rats, which might be involved with S1P1 enhancement.
