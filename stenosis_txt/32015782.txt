Title: A case of cystic adventitial disease of the poplitealartery: selection of incision of the cyst wall overvessel replacement.

Abstract: Cystic adventitial disease (CAD), a rare arterial disorder, can cause localized arterial stenosis or obstruction. A 55-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of left lower leg pain and paleness when bending the left knee. The patient was diagnosed with CAD of the left popliteal artery based on imaging examinations. Surgery was performed with the patient placed in the prone position using an S-shaped skin incision, and the left popliteal artery was exposed. A simple incision of the cyst wall was made. There was no sign of recurrence at 1 year postoperatively.
