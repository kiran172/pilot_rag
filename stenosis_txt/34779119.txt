Title: Three-year outcome of directional atherectomy and drug coated balloon for the treatment of common femoral artery steno-occlusive lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endarterectomy is considered the gold standard therapy for common femoral artery (CFA) steno-occlusive lesions, but a significant risk of perioperative mortality and complications has been reported.
OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy at a long-term follow-up of patients with CFA steno-occlusive lesions treated with directional atherectomy and drug coated balloon (DCB).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this single-center registry, 78 patients (male: 80.7%; age: 71 ± 15 years; occlusions: 25%) with 80 CFA lesions were included, with 39.7% of them undergoing directional atherectomy and drug coated balloon due to critical limb ischemia and 60.3% due to lower-limb intermittent claudication. The long-term follow-up was completed by 75 patients (3 years). The 31 patients with critical ischemia (39.7%) were further subdivided into 20 (25.6%) patients with pain at rest and 11 (14.1%) with trophic changes, ulcers and/or tissue loss. We considered the primary and the secondary outcome, referring, respectively to peak systolic velocity ratio (PSVR) ≥ 2.4 on duplex or > 50% stenosis on digital subtraction angiography at 36 months and to clinically driven target lesion revascularization at 36 months.
RESULTS: The primary and secondary outcome was obtained in 84% and 86.7% of patients, at 36 months of follow up. Bailout stenting was necessary in 6/80 cases (7.5%) for suboptimal result. Freedom from MALE was obtained in 98.6% of patients.
CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that directional atherectomy and drug coated balloon strategy for the treatment of CFA lesions is effective at a long-term follow-up and could be considered as a good alternative to surgery.
