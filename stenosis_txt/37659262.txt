Title: Rotational Atherectomy Versus Intravascular Lithotripsy for Calcified In-Stent Restenosis: A Single-Center Study With 1-Year Follow-Up.

Abstract: Although rotational atherectomy (RA) and intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) have been proved to be effective for calcified de novo coronary lesions, their use in patients with in-stent restenosis (ISR) is still controversial. No comparison of these techniques in patients with ISR has been published so far. We sought to evaluate safety and feasibility of RA and IVL in patients with calcified ISR. Furthermore, we aimed to compare in-hospital and 1-year clinical outcomes between both groups. This is a retrospective single-center study evaluating patients with calcified ISR treated with RA (between 2012 and 2021) and IVL (between 2019 and 2021). Inhospital and 1-year clinical outcomes were compared between IVL and RA patients. In total, 28 patients with ISR who underwent RA were compared with 24 ISR subjects after IVL. The procedural success rate was 100% in both the groups. Quantitative coronary analysis demonstrated a similar degree of stenosis prior (66.4 ± 11.4 vs 68.8 ± 19.7, p = nonsignificant [NS]), and after the procedure (21.5 ± 20.5 vs 22.8 ± 12.1, p = NS) with no difference in acute luminal gain (1.34 ± 0.60 vs 1.38 ± 0.59, p = NS). There was one in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular event in the RA group. At 1-year follow-up, no difference was observed with respect to major adverse cardiovascular event rate (14.3% vs 16.7%, p = NS) and target vessel revascularization (7.1% vs 12.5%, p = NS). In conclusion, RA and IVL are safe and feasible techniques for calcified ISR yielding comparable results at 1-year follow-up. Further clinical studies are warranted to confirm our findings and shed more light on patient and lesion characteristics associated with the best outcomes.
