Title: Major complications of sigmoid vaginoplasty: a case series.

Abstract: This case series explores the major complications following sigmoid vaginoplasty in two transgender female patients. Both patients experienced significant post-operative complications, including stenosis and abscess formation, leading to sigmoid conduit ischemia and necrosis. These complications required major surgical interventions and multidisciplinary care, highlighting the complexity of these procedures and their potential morbidity. Our analysis suggests that the initial stenotic insult led to obstruction and vascular insult to the sigmoid conduit, necessitating resection of the affected bowel. The outcomes underscore the need for collaboration across specialties for optimal post-operative monitoring and management. This study advocates for future management guidelines promoting multidisciplinary collaboration to reduce morbidity and resource burdens associated with complications. Despite the complications, sigmoid vaginoplasty remains a viable gender affirmation surgery, providing an effective analogue to vaginal mucosa and offering improved neovaginal depth.
