Title: Robotic-assisted laparoscopic modified ureteroplasty using lingual mucosa grafts or appendiceal flaps for the management of complex ureteral strictures: a retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of robot-assisted laparoscopic modified ureteroplasty using a lingual mucosa graft (LMG) or an appendiceal flap (AF) for complex ureteral strictures and summarize our experience.
METHODS: A total of 16 patients with complex ureteral strictures (range: 1.5-5 cm) who underwent robotic-assisted laparoscopic-modified ureteroplasty and were admitted to our hospital from May 2022-October 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. We used modified presuture methods in patients who needed the posteriorly augmented anastomotic technique to reduce anastomotic tension. Perioperative variables and outcomes were recorded for each patient.
RESULTS: The operation under robot-assisted laparoscopy was successfully performed in all sixteen patients (12 with LMG ureteroplasty and 4 with AF ureteroplasty) without conversion to open surgery. The mean length of the ureteral structure was 2.90 ± 0.90 cm (range: 1.5-5 cm), the mean operation duration was 209.69 ± 26.74 min (range: 170-255 min), the median estimated blood loss was 75 (62.5) ml (range: 50-200 ml), and the duration of postoperative hospitalization was 10.44 ± 2.10 d (range: 7-14 d). The follow-up time in this group was 6 ~ 21 months. The success rate of the surgery was 100%.
CONCLUSION: Robot-assisted laparoscopic modified ureteroplasty using AF or LMG is a safe and feasible operation for complex ureteral strictures and deserves to be popularized.
