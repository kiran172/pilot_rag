Title: Ureteroenteric anastomosis in orthotopic neobladder creation: do urinary tract infections impact stricture rate?

Abstract: PURPOSE: Radical cystectomy (RC) and urinary diversion in the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder cancer is associated with peri-operative complication rates as high as 60%. Ureteroenteric anastomotic stricture (UEAS) is a potential source significant morbidity often requiring secondary interventions. We sought to evaluate our experience with benign UEAS in our open ileal orthotopic neobladder (ON) population.
METHODS: After Internal Review Board (IRB) approval, we performed a retrospective review of patients who had RC and ON between 2000 and 2015 at MD Anderson Cancer Center and had at least 6 months of follow-up. Baseline demographics and treatment characteristics, peri-operative and post-operative outcomes, as well as information regarding anastomosis technique and suture types were evaluated. Patients with malignant ureteral obstruction were excluded from the analysis.
RESULTS: 418 patients had ON creation and the mean age was 59 years (SD 9.4 years) and 90% were males. The mean follow-up was 57 months (6-183 months). 37 patients (8.9%) developed UEAS in 42 renal units and the mean time to diagnosis was 15.8 months (0.85-90 months). Anastomosis and suture type were not predictive of UEAS (p = 0.594, p = 0.586). Perioperative UTI within 30 days of surgery, and recurrent UTI were predictive of UEAS, HR 2.4 p = 0.03, HR 5.1 p < 0.001, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: UEAS are associated with potentially significant morbidity following ON creation. UEAS may occur early following ON, but may occur as late as 7 years following surgery. Indeed, technical factors and surgeon experience contribute to the rates of UEAS, but perioperative UTI appears to herald future stricture development.
