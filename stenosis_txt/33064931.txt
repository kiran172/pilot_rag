Title: Endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy for hepaticojejunostomy stricture using a one-step stent deployment technique (with video).

Abstract: Highlight A novel, fully covered, self-expandable metal stent with a fine-gauge stent delivery system has recently become available in Japan. Ogura and colleagues describe the technical procedure of endoscopic ultrasound-guided hepaticogastrostomy using a one-step stent deployment technique without fistula dilation, which is clinically useful and may help prevent adverse events.
