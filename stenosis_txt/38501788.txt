Title: Enhancing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) outcomes through virtual proctoring: a case series analysis.

Abstract: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) represents a pivotal advancement in the management of severe aortic stenosis, offering a minimally invasive alternative to surgical valve replacement. Despite its widespread adoption, the complexity of TAVI procedures, especially in high-risk anatomical scenarios such as valve-in-valve interventions, necessitates ongoing educational support for operators. This article explores the implementation of a virtual proctoring system for complex TAVI procedures, evaluating its feasibility, educational value, and impact on procedural success and safety.
