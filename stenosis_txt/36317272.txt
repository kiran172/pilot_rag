Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in the Descending Aorta: History Revisited!

Abstract: An elderly patient with significant aortic regurgitation presented with heart failure. Dilation of the aortic root precluded a transcatheter anatomic site valve implantation, and prohibitive operative risk ruled against surgical implantation. A bail-out transcatheter implantation of the aortic valve in the descending aorta was successfully carried out with satisfactory outcomes.
