Title: Prospective, Multicenter Clinical Study of the Covera Vascular Covered Stent in the Treatment of Stenosis at the Graft-Vein Anastomosis of Dysfunctional Hemodialysis Access Grafts.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To study the use of the self-expanding Covera covered stent for the treatment of stenotic lesions at the venous anastomosis of hemodialysis arteriovenous grafts (AVGs).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 110 patients with AVG venous anastomotic stenosis of ≥50% and access dysfunction were treated at 14 centers in the United States using percutaneous transluminal angioplasty followed by covered stent placement. The primary end points were 30-day safety and 6-month target lesion primary patency (TLPP). The secondary measures included access circuit primary patency, circuit cumulative patency, and the number of reinterventions through 24 months.
RESULTS: Freedom from a primary safety event at 30 days was 96.4% while the 6-month TLPP rate was 70.3%. Seventy-five patients completed 24-month follow-up (68.2%). The TLPP rates were 54.2% at 365 days and 36.9% at 730 days while the access circuit primary patency rates were 16.7% at 365 days and 7.8% at 730 days (Kaplan-Meier analysis). The access circuit cumulative patency rates were 85.4% at 12 months and 73.6% at 24 months. The number of reinterventions to maintain the patency of the access circuit was 3.6 ± 3.1 at 24 months (1.6 ± 1.9 at the target lesion).
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the Covera covered stent for hemodialysis graft-vein anastomotic stenosis provided a safe treatment option with a TLPP rate of 70.3% at 6 months and TLPP and cumulative access circuit patency rates of 36.9% and 73.6% at 2 years.
