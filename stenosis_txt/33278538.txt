Title: Outcomes after transfemoral carotid artery stenting stratified by preprocedural symptom status.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The available data on outcomes after transfemoral carotid artery stenting (TFCAS) originate from the early experience with TFCAS. Although most previous studies stratified outcomes according to a symptomatic or asymptomatic presentation, they often did not specify the degree of presenting neurologic injury. We previously reported that the outcomes after carotid endarterectomy differed according to neurologic injury severity, the contemporary perioperative outcomes of TFCAS stratified by the specific presenting symptom status are unknown.
METHODS: Patients with data in the Vascular Quality Initiative database who had undergone TFCAS from 2016 to 2020 were included. We stratified patients according to their preprocedural symptom status as asymptomatic, formerly symptomatic (last symptoms >180 days before the procedure), or recently symptomatic (symptoms <180 days before the procedure). The symptoms included stroke, hemispheric transient ischemic attack (TIA), and ocular TIA. We compared the occurrence of in-hospital stroke or death (stroke/death) among the asymptomatic, formerly symptomatic, and specific subtypes of recently symptomatic patients. Multivariable logistic regression models were constructed to adjust for the baseline differences among the groups.
RESULTS: Of the 9807 included patients, 2650 (27%) had had recent stroke, 842 (9%), recent hemispheric TIA, and 360 (4%), recent ocular TIA. In addition, 795 patients (8%) were formerly symptomatic and 5160 (53%) were asymptomatic. The patients with recent stroke had a perioperative stroke/death rate of 5.5%, higher than that of patients with recent hemispheric TIA (2.4%; P < .001) or recent ocular TIA (2.8%; P = .03) and asymptomatic patients (1.4%; P < .001). The stroke/death rate was greater for patients with recent ocular TIA than for asymptomatic patients (2.8% vs 1.4%; P = .04). Formerly symptomatic patients had higher stroke/death rates compared with asymptomatic patients (3.5% vs 1.4%; P < .001). On multivariable-adjusted analysis, recent stroke was associated with higher stroke/death compared with recent hemispheric TIA (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-4.3; P < .001) and asymptomatic status (OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 3.0-5.6; P < .001) and demonstrated a trend toward higher stroke/death compared with recent ocular TIA (OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.0-3.9; P = .06). Furthermore, asymptomatic status was associated with lower stroke/death compared with formerly symptomatic status (OR, 0.4; 95% CI, 0.2-0.6; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: For patients undergoing TFCAS, recent stroke was associated with greater odds of in-hospital stroke/death after TFCAS compared with recent hemispheric TIA. Also, formerly symptomatic status was associated with greater odds of stroke/death compared with asymptomatic status. These findings support further symptom stratification by the degree of the presenting neurologic injury in the preoperative risk assessment.
