Title: Transcatheter Edge-to-Edge Repair for a Patient With Severe Mitral Regurgitation of Carpentier IIIa Classification.

Abstract: Whether patients diagnosed with mitral regurgitation of Carpentier class IIIa (rheumatic origin) can possibly be treated with balloon mitral commissurotomy followed by transcatheter edge-to-edge repair remains unclear. Here, we report on such a case who was successfully treated with balloon mitral commissurotomy and then transcatheter edge-to-edge repair without aggravating mitral stenosis. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
