Title: Secondary coronary artery ostial lesions: Three case reports.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis is one of the main causes of coronary artery ostial lesions seen clinically. Secondary coronary artery ostial lesions are rare, and cases reported previously were associated with syphilitic vasculitis and aortic dissection. Here, we report three rare cases of secondary coronary ostial lesions. Due to their rareness, these lesions can easily be neglected, which may lead to misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis.
CASE SUMMARY: We present three patients with acute myocardial infarction and unstable angina caused by secondary coronary artery ostial lesions. In Case 1, coronary angiography (CAG) revealed 90% stenosis of the left main coronary ostium. Chest contrast computed tomography (CT) suggested thymic carcinoma invading the left main coronary ostium. Coronary artery bypass grafting and tumor resection were performed. In Case 2, echocardiography revealed a sinus of Valsalva aneurysm (SVA)-like dilatation. CAG showed a right coronary sinus giant aneurysm and complete obstruction of the right coronary artery (RCA) ostium. Aortic contrast CT confirmed these findings. The Bentall procedure was performed. In Case 3, CT CAG identified an anomalous origin of the right coronary artery (AORCA) from the left sinus of Valsalva coursing between the aorta and pulmonary trunk, causing severe RCA ostium stenosis by compression. Surgical correction of the AORCA was performed.
CONCLUSION: The cases reported here suggest that we should consider other causes of coronary ostial lesions other than atherosclerosis.
