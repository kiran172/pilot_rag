Title: Transperineal microwave thermoablation for benign prostatic hyperplasia-related lower urinary tract symptoms in an elderly patient.

Abstract: Transperineal prostate microwave thermoablation (TPMT) has been established as a safe means of treating benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH); however, its effectiveness in addressing BPH-related lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) remains unexplored. This case study aims to evaluate the efficacy of TPMT in LUTS attributed to BPH. An 84-year-old man with LUTS due to BPH-induced bladder outlet obstruction, unresponsive to previous medical treatments, and failed prostate artery embolization, underwent TPMT. Three coaxial needles were positioned at the midline, right, and left sides of the hypertrophic transitional zone of the prostate. Microwave energy, with parameters determined using liver data and targeted ablation area, was applied at 2,450 MHz in continuous mode. The tissue temperature was monitored using bilateral thermocouple sensors. The patient exhibited no changes in defecation rhythm, abdominal discomfort, or anorectal pain. Temporary postoperative hematuria was promptly resolved through saline irrigation within 6 hours, and hematological evaluations showed normal results. Significant clinical improvements were observed (e.g., prostate volume, prostate-specific antigen levels) accompanied by an increase in peak flow rate. Thus, TPMT appears to be a promising intervention for bladder outlet stenosis and LUTS induced by BPH.
