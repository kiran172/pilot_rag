Title: Evaluation of restless leg syndrome symptoms in patients with lumbosacral canal stenosis comparison with normal population.

Abstract: Introduction: Restless leg syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder that causes an irresistible urge to move the legs often associated with an unpleasant sensation. Due to some common presentations between RLS and lumbosacral spinal stenosis, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the symptoms of RLS in the presence of spinal stenosis at the same time as normal populations.Materials and methods: This cross-sectional study examined 45 patients with lumbosacral spinal canal stenosis and 45 normal individuals without a specific disease. Patients aged 50-70 years were included in the study. All the statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS 21.0 software and p &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Results: 19 subjects (42.22%) in the patient group and eight in the normal group (17.8%) suffered from restless leg syndrome. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that patients with lumbosacral canal stenosis had almost five score less than others in RLS scale.Conclusion: RLS symptoms were more prominent in lumbosacral canal stenosis patients compared to the normal group. The awareness of its symptoms can help reduce misdiagnosis.
