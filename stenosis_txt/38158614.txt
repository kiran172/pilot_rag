Title: Risk Factor Analysis of Surgery-related Complications in Primary Thoracic Spine Surgery for Degenerative Diseases and Characteristics of the Patients Also Undergoing Surgery on the Cervical and/or Lumbar Spine.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study using prospectively collected data.
OBJECTIVE: This study primarily aimed to investigate the risk factors for surgery-related complications in primary thoracic spine surgery for degenerative diseases using a surgeon-maintained database. The secondary purpose was to elucidate the characteristics of surgically treated thoracic myelopathy that also required cervical and/or lumbar spine surgery in the study period.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Few studies reported surgical complications and the feature of tandem spinal stenosis in thoracic myelopathy in detail because of their rarity.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 840 thoracic myelopathy patients undergoing primary surgery for degenerative diseases from 2012 to 2021, investigating the effects of diseases, surgical procedures, and patient demographics on postoperative neurological deterioration, dural tear, dural leakage, surgical-site infection, and postoperative hematoma. In thoracic myelopathy patients who were surgically treated and also undergoing cervical and/or lumbar surgery, we investigated the proportion, the effects of diseases, and the order and intervals between surgeries.
RESULTS: Multivariate logistic regression revealed that significant risk factors ( P <0.05) for postoperative neurological deterioration were intervertebral disk herniation [odds ratio (OR): 4.59, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.32-16.0) and degenerative spondylolisthesis (OR: 11.1, 95% CI: 2.15-57.5). Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OR: 4.12, 95% CI: 1.92-8.86), anterior spinal fusion (OR: 41.2, 95% CI: 4.70-361), and circumferential decompression via a posterior approach (OR: 30.5, 95% CI: 2.27-410) were risk factors for dural tear. In thoracic myelopathy patients surgically treated, 37.0% also underwent degenerative cervical and/or lumbar surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Pathologies involving anterior decompression and instability increased the risk of postoperative neurological deterioration. The risk of dural tear was increased when dura mater adhesions were likely to be directly operated upon. It should be recognized that a relatively high proportion (37.0%) of surgically treated thoracic myelopathy patients also underwent cervical and/or lumbar surgery.
