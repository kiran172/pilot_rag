Title: Early and mid-term outcomes of total repair of tetralogy of Fallot through a right subaxillary thoracotomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the safety, feasibility and early and mid-term outcomes of total repair of elective tetralogy of Fallot through a right subaxillary thoracotomy.
METHODS: Between May 2010 and September 2015, a retrospective review of patients with elective tetralogy of Fallot undergoing primary repair through a right subaxillary thoracotomy was performed. This study included 47 patients [27 males, 20 females; the mean age of 1.7 ± 1.5 years (ranging from 3 to 106 months); body weight of 9.7 ± 2.8 kg (ranging from 5 to 16 kg); McGoon ratio ≥1.5]. The ventricular septal defects were approached through a right atriotomy in 30 patients, a right ventriculotomy in 8 patients and the combination of a right atriotomy and ventriculotomy in 9 patients. Transannular and non-transannular patches were used in 20 and 27 patients, respectively.
RESULTS: There was 1 operative death (2.1%), and the others recovered uneventfully. The median cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamping times was 79 ± 20.8 (45-136) and 50 ± 15.7 (25-94) min, respectively. The mechanical ventilation time, length of intensive care unit and postoperative hospital stay were 0.9 ± 0.6, 2.6 ± 1.1 and 10.7 ± 2.7 days, respectively. The main complications involved low cardiac output syndrome in 5 patients, arrhythmia in 6 patients, pulmonary infection in 4 patients, small residual shunt in 2 patients, mild residual right ventricular outflow tract obstruction in 2 patients, mild tricuspid regurgitation in 3 patients and atelectasis in 1 patient. The mean follow-up time was 82 ± 22.0 months, and no late deaths occurred during the follow-up. One (2.1%) patient received reintervention for residual significant pulmonary artery stenosis. That was in addition to 2 (4.3%) patients having mild residual right ventricular outflow tract, 1 (2.1%) patient with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and 3 (6.4%) patients with moderate pulmonary valve regurgitation to be followed up.
CONCLUSIONS: The right subaxillary thoracotomy, providing a safe and feasible alternative, can be performed with a low mortality rate and satisfactory early and mid-term outcomes for total repair of elective tetralogy of Fallot.
