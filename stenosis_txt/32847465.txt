Title: Transradial access for arteriovenous fistuloplasty in Singapore.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endovascular balloon angioplasty is standard therapy for dysfunctional arteriovenous fistula in end-stage renal failure patients on hemodialysis. Venous antegrade or retrograde puncture of the fistula is typically performed to gain access for fistuloplasty. Transradial approach for brachiocephalic or brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistulas offers an alternative method of access with the advantage of addressing multi-focal juxta-anastomotic and venous stenosis from the same approach. We aim to review the efficacy, outcomes and complication rates of transradial access for arteriovenous fistuloplasty among patients in Singapore.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 195 endovascular fistuloplasties from September 2017 to August 2019, at a tertiary university hospital Vascular Surgery unit.
RESULTS: Of 195 fistuloplasties, 43 (22%) were transradial approach (23 brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulas, 20 brachiobasilic arteriovenous fistulas) in 33 patients (67% male and mean age = 65 years). Of these 43 procedures, 11 (26%) were performed as balloon-assisted maturation fistuloplasties while 32 (74%) were performed for mature arteriovenous fistulas with multi-focal juxta-anastomosis and venous stenosis. Technical success rate was 95% with mean procedure duration at 43.5 ± 14.6 min. Mean pre- and post-fistuloplasty dialysis access flow rates increased from 502 to 952 ml/min (p < 0.001). Post-intervention primary patency was 100%, 66% and 20% at 1, 6 and 12 months, respectively. There were four patients with non-limb-threatening radial artery thrombosis (9.3%) while there was no radial artery pseudoaneurysm or post-procedural bleeding.
CONCLUSION: Transradial approach for arteriovenous fistuloplasty is a safe and feasible option in patients requiring balloon-assisted maturation or with multi-focal juxta-anastomotic and venous stenosis.
