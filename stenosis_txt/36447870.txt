Title: Rod migration through foramen magnum into posterior fossa after cervical spine lateral mass fixation: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Posterior cervical fusion is one of the most common surgical procedures performed for the treatment of many cervical spine pathologies. Hardware failure, due to rod displacement either cranially or caudally, may occur.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Two years following a subaxial laminectomy/lateral mass fusion (from C3 to C6) for stenosis, a 67-year-old female, with a history of trauma 2 months ago, presented with headaches, right-sided facial palsy, and right complete ophthalmoplegia. When the computed tomography scan showed migration of the left-sided rod extending into the posterior fossa through the foramen magnum plus malpositioning of the right rod, she underwent bilateral rod removal resulting in marked headache improvement without improvement of ophthalmoplegia and facial palsy.
CONCLUSION: Cephalad rod migration/displacement extending through the foramen magnum into the posterior fossa is a rare complication of cervical laminectomy/rod lateral mass screw instrumented fusion.
