Title: Analysis of Preoperative CT Scan Can Help Predict Technical Failure of Endovascular Treatment of TASC C-D Aortoiliac Chronic Total Occlusions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To evaluate if features of occlusion analyzable on preoperative computed tomography scan could predict risks of technical failure or iliac rupture of endovascular treatment of TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus C-D aortoiliac chronic total occlusion.
METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients treated by endovascular techniques for a TransAtlantic InterSociety Consensus C-D aortoiliac chronic total occlusion between 2009 and 2016 were included (107 patients, 148 iliac arteries). We evaluated the location of the occlusion and the importance of the arterial calcifications. For this factor, patients were divided into 3 groups: the Black occlusion group with mild or no calcifications, the white occlusion group with moderate no protrusive calcifications, and the white protrusive occlusion group with heavy endoluminal calcifications. Technical failure occurred in 11 iliac arteries and peroperative iliac rupture in 6. The location in the external iliac artery is the most significate risk factor of technical failure in univariate (OR = 9.93; P = 0.0012) and multivariate analysis (OR = 15.26; P = 0.0006). The presence of heavy endoluminal calcifications is a further significate risk factor (OR = 13.88; P = 0.0365). Rupture rate was comparable between the 3 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative computed tomography scan can predict risk of technical failure but not of iliac rupture.
