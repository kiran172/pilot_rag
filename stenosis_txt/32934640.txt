Title: Keyhole anesthesia-Perioperative management of subglottic stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Any narrowing in the airway presents as obstruction and with features of noisy breathing. The presence of subglottic stenosis poses a great challenge to the anesthesiologist. Diagnostic and corrective procedures by Otolaryngologist require rigid endoscopy which demands apneic ventilation. Hence, the goal of general anesthesia in the presence of subglottic stenosis requires a patent airway to maintain oxygenation and ventilation and avoid hypoxia. We present an interesting case of a preterm neonate with subglottic stenosis who was managed successfully with endoscopic release.
