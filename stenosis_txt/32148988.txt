Title: Gradenigo's Syndrome with Carotid Septic Stenosis.

Abstract: Gradenigo's syndrome was firstly described in 1907 by Giusseppe Gradenigo and is defined as the clinical triad of suppurative otitis media, ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy, and pain in the distribution of the first and the second branches of the trigeminal nerve. Since the advent of antibiotics, the incidence of this potentially life-threatening complication has diminished, but occasional cases still occur. We herein report a pediatric case of otitis media associated with Gradenigo's syndrome complicated by ipsilateral septic cavernous sinus thrombosis and infectious arteritis of the internal carotid artery.
