Title: Intravascular Lithotripsy for Treatment of Calcified Lower Extremity Arterial Stenosis: Initial Analysis of the Disrupt PAD III Study.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate the performance of peripheral intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) in a real-world setting during endovascular treatment of multilevel calcified peripheral artery disease (PAD). Materials and Methods: The Disrupt PAD III Observational Study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT02923193) is a prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, single-arm observational study assessing the acute safety and effectiveness of the Shockwave Peripheral IVL System for the treatment of calcified, stenotic lower limb arteries. Patients were eligible if they had claudication or chronic limb-threatening ischemia and moderate or severe arterial calcification. Between November 2017 and August 2018, 200 patients (mean age 72.5Â±8.7 years; 148 men) were enrolled across 18 sites and followed through hospital discharge. Results: In the 220 target lesions, IVL was more commonly used in combination with other balloon-based technologies (53.8%) and less often with concomitant atherectomy or stenting (19.8% and 29.9%, respectively). There was a 3.4-mm average acute gain at the end of procedure; the final mean residual stenosis was 23.6%. Angiographic complications were rare, with only 2 type D dissections and a single perforation following drug-coated balloon inflation (unrelated to the IVL procedure). There was no abrupt closure, distal embolization, no reflow, or thrombotic event. Conclusion: Use of peripheral IVL to treat severely calcified, stenotic PAD in a real-world study demonstrated low residual stenosis, high acute gain, and a low rate of complications despite the complexity of disease.
