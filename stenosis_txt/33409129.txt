Title: Successful long-term limb salvage using cephalic and small saphenous vein grafts: A case report.

Abstract: In this case report, we present a patient scheduled for operation due to critical leg ischemia in whom a bilateral great saphenous vein (GSV) had already been used during previous cardiac and peripheral vascular surgeries. The patient underwent femorofemoral crossover bypass from left to right with a small saphenous vein and right femoropopliteal bypass with cephalic vein (CV) during the same session. Distal pulses became palpable, and symptoms regressed dramatically following the operation. A control computed tomographic angiography scan revealed no signs of graft stenosis 32 months after the surgery. Despite the recent advances in synthetic graft materials, small saphenous and CVs should be remembered as alternative long-standing conduits in the absence of the GSV.
