Abstract: The stone inside the Allium bulbar urethral stent for treatment of urethral stenosis is an exceedingly rare disease. Herein, we report a case of the stone inside the Allium bulbar urethral stent(BUS) for treating urethral stricture in a 48-year-old Chinese male patient. The patient underwent a cystoscopy and URS for the stone inside BUS. The patient had only a symptom of urodynia. Urination of the patient is unobstructed after removing BUS and the urethral stricture of the patient was cured.
