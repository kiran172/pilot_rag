Title: ST-segment resolution as a marker for severe myocardial fibrosis in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between ST-segment resolution (STR) and myocardial scar thickness after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
METHODS: Forty-two STEMI patients with single-branch coronary artery stenosis or occlusion were enrolled. ST-segment elevations were measured at emergency admission and at 24 h after PCI. Late gadolinium-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR-LGE) was performed 7 days after PCI to evaluate myocardial scars. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the utility of STR to predict the development of transmural (> 75%) or non-transmural (< 75%) myocardial scars, according to previous study.
RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of STR for predicting transmural scars were 96% and 88%, respectively, at an STR cut-off value of 40.15%. The area under the curve was 0.925. Multivariate logistic proportional hazards regression analysis disclosed that patients with STR < 40.15% had a 170.90-fold higher probability of developing transmural scars compared with patients with STR ≥ 40.15%. Pearson correlation and linear regression analyses showed STR percentage was significantly associated with myocardial scar thickness and size.
CONCLUSION: STR < 40.15% at 24 h after PCI may provide meaningful diagnostic information regarding the extent of myocardial scarification in STEMI patients.
