Title: Moyamoya disease presenting with symptomatic ischemic stroke during new-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment: two illustrative cases.

Abstract: Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been widely used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. Nilotinib and ponatinib, which are second- and third-generation TKIs, have been reported to cause cerebrovascular arterial complications. Here, we present two cases of moyamoya disease presenting with symptomatic ischemic stroke during new-generation TKI treatment. We judged that new-generation TKI treatment was a factor in symptomatic ischemic stroke of unknown moyamoya disease in both cases. Noninvasive examinations using magnetic resonance imaging or carotid ultrasonography should be performed before and during new-generation TKI treatment in order to prevent symptomatic ischemic stroke.
