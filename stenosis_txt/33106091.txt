Title: Mega Fistulae! A case series.

Abstract: A mega fistula can be defined as generalized aneurysmal dilatation of arteriovenous fistula. Mega fistulae can lead to complications like high output cardiac failure, steal syndrome, skin ulceration and rupture. We describe a series of ten patients who were referred to our interventional nephrology practice for evaluation of mega fistula which had not been in use for a long time. Nine out of ten patients were post-transplant while one was pre dialysis. Five patients had Radiocephalic while four had Brachiocephalic and one had Brachial artery to Median Cubital vein fistula. All except one patient had severe outflow stenosis. The most common site of stenosis in Radiocepahlic and Brachiocepahlic fistula was cephalic vein at the elbow and cephalic arch respectively. Half of the patients had chronic total occlusion of the outflow vein. Successful angioplasty was done in only two patients. Seven patients underwent ligation while one had spontaneous thrombosis of the fistula. None of the patients had regular surveillance of their access for a long time as they were not on dialysis. Unrecognized and uncorrected outflow stenosis over a long time period can lead to creation of mega fistula. Once a mega fistula develops there are not many treatment options other than ligation. This leads to loss of the access which might be needed in future. Continuous access surveillance in patients who are not on dialysis is important to prevent complications like mega fistula.
