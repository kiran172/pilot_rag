Title: Type 4 Dual Left Anterior Descending Artery: A Case Report of a Rare Congenital Coronary Anomaly.

Abstract: Dual left anterior descending artery (LAD) is a rare congenital coronary artery anomaly with a prevalence of approximately 1% in the general population. To date, 10 types of dual LAD artery anomalies have been reported. Among these, type 4 is one of the rarest. Knowledge and recognition of the dual LAD artery are important for correct diagnosis and planning of coronary bypass surgery and percutaneous coronary intervention. We report a case of a 59-year-old male with type 4 dual LAD artery who presented with dyspepsia and sweating for several months and had approximately 50%-70% stenosis in a major diagonal branch off the short LAD artery.
