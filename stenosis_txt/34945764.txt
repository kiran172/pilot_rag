Title: Towards Personalized Therapy of Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Calcific aortic stenosis (CAS) is the most common cause of acquired valvular heart disease in adults with no available pharmacological treatment to inhibit the disease progression to date. This review provides an up-to-date overview of current knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying CAS pathobiology and the related treatment pathways. Particular attention is paid to current randomized trials investigating medical treatment of CAS, including strategies based on lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapies, phosphate and calcium metabolism, and novel therapeutic targets such as valvular oxidative stress, coagulation proteins, matrix metalloproteinases, and accumulation of advanced glycation end products.
