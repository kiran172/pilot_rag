Title: Functional Quadriplegia as an Initial Presentation of Severe Rheumatoid Arthritis.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition with many manifestations primarily presenting in older female patients with joint stiffness. Quadriplegia associated with rheumatoid arthritis is common and can occur secondary to spinal cord compression from atlantoaxial dislocation. In contrast, functional quadriplegia is rare and has not been previously reported as an initial manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis. We report the case of a 56-year-old male with a past medical history ofÂ carotid artery stenosis, hypertension, and tobacco and alcohol misuse who presented to the emergency department with a five-month history of progressive bilateral shoulder pain and weakness resulting in functional quadriplegia. The patient required inpatient hospital admission for further evaluation of his functional quadriplegia and associated symptoms. His workup was significant for rheumatoid arthritis, and he was successfully treated with high-dose steroids and received physical and occupational therapy during admission. Prior to discharge, the patient was initiated on methotrexate therapy and appointed a follow-up with primary care and rheumatology. The purpose of this study is to facilitate early clinical recognition of a common disease with unique and underreported symptomatology.
