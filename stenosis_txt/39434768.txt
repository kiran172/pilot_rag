Title: Rapidly worsening lung adenocarcinoma due to diffusely spreading lymphangitic carcinomatosis: A case report.

Abstract: Lymphangitic carcinomatosis is a metastatic disease with a poor prognosis and poorly understood pathophysiology. We present a case of rapidly worsening lung adenocarcinoma with diffusely spreading cancerous lymphangitis in lung, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and gastrointestinal tract. Our findings suggest cancer dissemination in this patient was predominantly caused by direct lymphatic invasion.
