Title: Intravenous thrombolysis versus dual antiplatelet therapy in minor ischemic stroke within the thrombolytic window (TAMIS): a multicenter cohort study.

Abstract: Intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) have been widely used in minor ischemic stroke (MIS) treatment. However, the clinical outcomes and safety of these two treatments have not been compared within the early thrombolytic time window. Here, we conducted a multicenter, ambispective cohort study involving patients with MIS presenting within 4.5 h of symptom onset at 3 affiliated hospitals of Jinan University from 2018-2022. The patients were divided into the IVT group and DAPT group. The primary outcome was a 90-day excellent outcome (mRS ≤ 1). A total of 1,026 patients were enrolled, of whom 492 were assigned to the IVT group and 534 were assigned to the DAPT group. The IVT group had better 90-day excellent outcomes (mRS ≤ 1) than the DAPT group (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.14-2.52, P = 0.010). Among the 623 patients with nondisabling stroke, the proportion of mRS ≤ 1 in the IVT group was higher than the DAPT group (P = 0.009). In the subtypes of MIS with large vessel occlusion/stenosis and with isolated symptoms, the 90-day outcomes of the IVT group and DAPT group were not different (P > 0.05). In conclusion, compared with DAPT, IVT was associated with better 90-day clinical outcomes in patients with MIS (in particular, for those with mRS > 1), including earlier clinical improvement.IVT also benefited the early neurological improvement of patients with severe stenosis/occlusion of intracranial large vessels, nondisabling mild stroke, nondisabling mild stroke with isolated symptoms.
