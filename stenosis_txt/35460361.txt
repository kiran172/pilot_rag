Title: Syringing has limited reliability in differentiating nasolacrimal duct stenosis from functional delay.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To elucidate the role of syringing in assessing nasolacrimal duct (NLD) stenosis and non-anatomical functional NLD delay.
METHODS: Consecutive adult patients with epiphora attending a tertiary lacrimal clinic from June 2011 to March 2021 were reviewed. Cases with evidence of canalicular stenosis or other identifiable causes of epiphora were excluded. Following syringing, patients were investigated with dacryocystography (DCG) and dacryoscintigraphy (DSG). The sensitivity and specificity of syringing were evaluated using the combined findings on DCG and DSG.
RESULTS: A total of 289 symptomatic lacrimal systems (197 patients; mean age 65.5 ± 14.9 years, 66% females) were included. More than one-third of cases with both normal DCG and DSG were noted to have some degree of reflux on syringing (specificity = 65.1%, 95% CI 50.2-77.6%). The sensitivities were considerably low for NLD stenosis (i.e., stenosis on DCG and delay on DSG) and for functional NLD delay (i.e., normal DCG and delay on DSG), of which 43.7% (95% CI 32.2-55.9%) and 54.3% (95% CI 45.7-62.7%) had full patency on syringing, respectively (p = 0.17).
CONCLUSIONS: Full patency on syringing was unreliable for ruling out NLD stenosis and functional delay. Furthermore, a positive syringing may be associated with functional NLD delay and cannot reliably differentiate it from stenosis.
