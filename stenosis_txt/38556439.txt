Title: Operative Experience of Esophageal Surgery among General Surgery Residents in the United States: An Analysis of ACGME Operative Case Logs.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Esophageal surgery is an essential component of general surgery training and encompasses several types of cases that are logged by general surgery residents. There is a scarcity of data on the quality and volume of esophageal surgery experience during surgical residency in the United States. We analyzed trends for 9 different esophageal procedure categories logged by residents in the United States, with the aim to identify areas for improvement in training.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of operative case logs of all general surgery residents graduating from programs accredited by the ACGME over a fourteen-year period from 2009 to 2023. Data on mean esophageal cases reported by graduates, including mean in each procedure subcategory were retrieved. Cases were categorized as either surgeon chief or surgeon junior for each procedure category. Mann-Kendall trend test was used to obtain tau statistics and p-value for trends in mean operative surgical volume for the total number of cases in each operative category over the study period. Trends in surgeon chief and surgeon junior cases were also investigated for each operative category.
RESULTS: The mean number of all esophageal procedures performed per resident during their training increased significantly from 10.5 in 2009 to 16 in 2022 (τ = 0.833, p < 0.001). This trend observed among all esophageal procedures during this 14-year study can be largely attributed to the steady increase in the number and proportion of laparoscopic esophageal antireflux procedures performed (τ = 0.950, p < 0.001). Additionally, esophagectomy procedures had a statistically significant, but modest, increase during the study period (τ = 0.505, p = 0.023), from a mean of 1 case during training in 2009 to a peak of 1.3 in 2020. Although the general trend of esophagus procedures increased during the study period, most categories (7 out of 9) either decreased or did not significantly change. Esophagogastrectomy volume decreased significantly by 30%, from 1 per resident during their training in 2009 to 0.7 in 2022 (τ = -0.510, p = 0.018), esophageal diverticulectomy procedures decreased by 50% from 0.2 to 0.1 (τ = -0.609, p = 0.009), and operations for esophageal stenosis decreased by 75% from 0.4 to 0.1 (τ = -0.734, p = 0.001). Mean number of esophageal bypasses (τ = -0.128, p = 0.584), repair of perforated esophageal disease (τ = -0.333, p = 0.156), and other major esophagus procedures (τ = 0.416, p = 0.063) did not significantly change.
CONCLUSION: The operative volume of esophageal surgery that general surgery residents in the United States are exposed to has significantly risen over the past 14 years, largely driven by the increase in laparoscopic antireflux procedures. However, given the recent advances and the resultant heterogeneity in both esophageal surgery, the increase in resident operative volume is still inadequate to ensure the training of safe and adept esophageal surgeons, necessitating postresidency specialized training for trainees interested in esophageal surgery.
