Title: Aortic valve calcification volume and prognosis in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: It is unknown whether aortic valve calcium volume, as measured by contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (angio-CT), is associated with mortality in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We aimed to confirm that contrast-enhanced aortic valve calcium correlates with noncontrast-enhanced calcium score and provides useful prognostic information in patients undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study included patients from 2 high-volume TAVI centers in Germany, all of whom underwent high-quality angio-CT prior to TAVI. Calcium volume in contrast-enhanced angio-CT was calculated using 3Mensio software (Pie Medical, The Netherlands), while the calcium score from noncontrast-enhanced angio-CT was obtained using the Syngo.via (Siemens Healthineers, Germany) workstation to validate contrast-enhanced angio-CT values. Calcium volume was dichotomized using the median based on to sex-specific values from contrast-enhanced angio-CT, and the risk associated with increased calcium volume was determined using Cox proportional hazard regression analysis.
RESULTS: We included 3318 TAVI patients. A good correlation was observed between noncontrast-enhanced and contrast-enhanced angio-CT (r2 = 0.680; P &lt; .001). The median values for sex-specific contrast-enhanced angio-CT calcium volume were 514 mm3 for women and 1025 mm3 for men. Patients with higher calcium volumes showed lower mortality at 1 year (8.8% vs 12.1%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [95%CI], 0.75-0.98; P = .02) compared with those with lower calcium volumes.
CONCLUSIONS: Calcium volume in contrast-enhanced angio-CT correlated well with noncontrast-enhanced angio-CT calcium score. Patients with higher calcium volume showed lower mortality at 1 year after TAVI.
