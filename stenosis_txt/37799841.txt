Title: Balloon rupture with eversion during innominate vein angioplasty requiring surgical retrieval.

Abstract: Balloon rupture during angioplasty can with calcified or recalcitrant lesions. A 61-year-old woman presented with worsening arm and facial swelling. She had a history of left upper extremity thrombolysis and stenting of the innominate vein 6 years prior. Venography showed severe in-stent stenosis. After crossing the lesion, a 12-mm balloon was inflated, which ruptured at nominal pressure. The balloon became stuck and could not be moved over the wire even after retraction of the sheath. A limited surgical cutdown was performed, and the balloon and the wire were removed together. The ruptured balloon part was found to be everted and circumferentially wrapped around the wire, preventing the wire exchange. After cutting the everted portion of the balloon, the catheter was removed without losing wire access. A high-pressure balloon was subsequently used to treat the lesion successfully. Her symptoms had resolved on follow-up, and the stent remained patent after 6 months.
