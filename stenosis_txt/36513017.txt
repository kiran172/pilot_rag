Title: Long-term outcomes of a new anatomy-based method for finding the medial cut end during late canalicular repair.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Locating the medial cut end during late repair of canalicular lacerations can be challenging.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and long-term outcomes of a new anatomy-based method for solving the problem of locating the medial cut end.
METHODS: This retrospective interventional study included 85 eyes of 85 consecutive adult patients with unilateral inferior canalicular lacerations who underwent late primary (≥2 days after injury) or secondary (≥6 months after initial treatment) surgery. Before surgery, the lacerations were classified as lateral, central, or medial according to the 'distance from the punctum to the distal end' of the lacerated inferior canaliculus. The time spent to locate the proximal lacerated end (TSL) was recorded. All patients were followed up for ≥1 year to evaluate the lacrimal passage patency and the distance between the superior and inferior punctum (DBSIP, to assess cosmesis).
RESULTS: There were 16 (18.82%) lateral-type, 55 (64.71%) central-type, and 14 (16.47%) medial-type canalicular lacerations. The TSL was 3.48 ± 1.05 (range 0.9-6.8) min for all patients and differed significantly among the three types of canalicular lacerations (P < 0.001). Lacrimal irrigation showed patent lacrimal passages in 69 patients (81.18%) at 3 months and a further 4 patients (4.71%) at 6 months, residual stenosis without obstruction in 5 patients (5.88%), and obstruction in 7 patients (8.24%). The postoperative DBSIP on the affected side was shorter than the preoperative DBSIP (2.66 ± 0.66 vs. 3.09 ± 1.72 mm, P = 0.006) and comparable to that on the unaffected side (2.78 ± 0.40 mm).
CONCLUSION: Our new anatomy-based method is efficient and achieves good long-term outcomes for all types of late canalicular repair.
