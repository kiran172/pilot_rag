Title: Unusual Renal Uptake of 131 I-MIBG in a Young Hypertensive With Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: A 10-year-old hypertensive girl underwent 131 I-MIBG scan to rule out neural crest derived tumor. The whole-body images revealed diffuse intense tracer uptake in the right kidney, which persisted in 96-hour images as well. CT renal angiography revealed 90% to 95% right renal artery stenosis. Thereafter, she underwent baseline and angiotensin receptor blockade renal dynamic imaging, which revealed hemodynamically significant renal artery stenosis. Pattern of diffuse and intense 131 I-MIBG uptake, albeit rare, still warrants further evaluation to rule out renal artery stenosis and investigate its hemodynamic significance for appropriate management.
