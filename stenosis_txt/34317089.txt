Title: Erdheim-Chester Disease: A Case of Right Atrial Involvement and Superior Vena Cava Stenosis.

Abstract: We describe the case of a 79-year-old woman with a history of Erdheim-Chester disease who presented with bradyarrhythmia and infiltration of the superior vena cava and right atrium. This case highlights an important consideration in type of pacemaker placement given the frequency of right atrial involvement in Erdheim-Chester disease. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
