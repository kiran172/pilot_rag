Title: Surgical treatment of bony nasal airway stenosis in a patient with adult Crouzon's syndrome.

Abstract: Crouzon's syndrome is associated with the respiratory impairment of the upper airway due to mid-facial hypoplasia. We managed an adult Crouzon patient who wanted us to treat his choanal and nasopharyngeal stenosis for obstructive sleep apnea relief and tracheostomy tube extubation. We drilled out the abnormal maxillary bone and created a new nasal passage to the pharynx. Epithelialization of the new nasal cavity was completed within a month, and the patient was able to breathe through the nose and his sense of smell improved somewhat after the surgery. Although the apnea-hypopnea index had decreased, sleep apnea remained.
