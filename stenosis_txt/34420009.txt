Title: Marginal donors and organ shortness: concomitant surgical procedures during heart transplantation: a literature review.

Abstract: Heart transplantation represents the gold standard for end-stage heart failure. However, due to the increasing demand and the shortage of available organs, donor supply remains the main limitation. Marginal donor hearts in high-risk candidates who do not meet standard listing criteria are the only alternative when life expectancy is limited, but their use is still debated. Surgical correction of detected coronary lesions or valvular heart defects allows further enlargement of the number of available organs. In this article, we offer a literature review on this topic and report two marginal donor hearts with angiography evidence of coronary stenosis and preserved ventricular function, which underwent concomitant myocardial revascularization during heart implantation.
