Title: Influence of Spinopelvic Alignment on the Clinical Outcomes Following Decompression Surgery for Lumbar Stenosis.

Abstract: Introduction The role of sagittal spinopelvic alignment in lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) patients and its potential influence on post-decompression surgery outcomes is a topic of growing interest. Lumbar spinal stenosis is a prevalent degenerative condition, and with an aging population, the frequency of surgical interventions for LSS has risen. While decompression surgery aims to relieve symptoms, the potential impact of preoperative spinopelvic alignment on postoperative results remains controversial. This study examined the correlation between sagittal spinopelvic parameters and clinical outcomes in LSS patients undergoing decompression surgery. Methods This study included 100 patients with LSS who underwent decompression surgery between 2021 and 2023 and 100 healthy individuals as a control group. The LSS group comprised 50 men and 50 women, with a mean age of 55.8±12.41 years, while the control group consisted of 50 men and 50 women, with a mean age of 55.17±13.39 years. Sagittal spinopelvic alignment parameters, including pelvic tilt (PT), pelvic incidence-lumbar lordosis mismatch, and sagittal vertical axis, were assessed preoperatively. Postoperative clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores. Results In the cohort of 200 participants, 100 were diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), and 100 were healthy controls. Both groups had an equal gender distribution (50 males and 50 females). The mean age was 55.8 (±12.4) years for the LSS group and 55.2 (±13.4) years for the control group. Among the analyzed radiographic parameters, only lumbar lordosis (LL) levels showed a significant difference between groups, notably lower in the LSS group (p=0.020). Preoperative VAS scores in LSS patients averaged 7.58±1.32, which postoperatively dropped to 2.22±1.95 (p<0.001). Similarly, ODI (%) declined from a preoperative average of 55.76±11.65 to 18.62±18.17 postoperatively (p<0.001). Patients with postoperative ODI levels exceeding 20% had higher preoperative scores and significantly altered radiographic measurements. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated PT as the most predictive radiographic parameter, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.945. Multivariate logistic regression pinpointed PT and LL as key predictors associated with increased risks for postoperative Oswestry disability levels exceeding 20%. Conclusion Our study suggests that sagittal spinopelvic alignment plays an important role in the development and progression of LSS. Addressing sagittal alignment may be crucial for achieving optimal clinical outcomes after decompression surgery. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the relationship between sagittal alignment and LSS.
