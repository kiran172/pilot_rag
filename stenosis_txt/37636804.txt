Title: Laryngeal Cyst in Children : A Retrospective Analysis.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Aim: To study the presentation, management and outcome of laryngeal cysts in children. Materials and methods: This is a retrospective observational study of children with Laryngeal cysts who were managed in the Department of Paediatric Surgery between April 2015 to Jan 2022. Observations and Results: Eight children with laryngeal cysts were included, 5 were girls. Age ranged from 3 days to 10 years (median 5 months). Weight ranged from 3kg to 40kg (median 6.3 kg). All presented with stridor. Three children had co-morbid conditions, one each with Leucocyte adhesion deficiency type -1, atrial septal defect &amp; PHACES syndrome. Two children had severe respiratory distress and required tracheostomy at presentation. All children underwent MLB. The cysts were 2 subglottic cysts (one inflammatory cyst) and 6 vallecular cyst. Five underwent endoscopic excision of cysts, 1 underwent excision with lateral cervical approach, 1 underwent endoscopic de-roofing of cyst and airway reconstruction with anterior costal cartilage graft (associated Sub glottis stenosis). Conclusion: Laryngeal cysts are a rare cause of stridor in children. MLB is the best diagnostic tool. Treatment with excision / deroofing of the cyst endoscopically, is safe and effective in paediatric age group.
