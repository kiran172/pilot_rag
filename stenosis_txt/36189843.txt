Title: Network Meta-Analysis of All Available Regimens Based on Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty and Laser Atherectomy for Femoropopliteal In-Stent Restenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty and laser atherectomy (LA) have been frequently utilized to treat femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis (ISR); however, no studies have concurrently compared available regimens, including DCB, LA+DCB, and LA + plain balloon angioplasty (PB). Therefore, we conducted this network meta-analysis to determine whether there were significant differences in outcomes among these regimens.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing DCB or LA-based regimes with POBA or each other for treating femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis (ISR) from their inception until March 2021. The primary outcome measure was binary restenosis, and secondary outcome measures were target lesion revascularization (TLR) and mortality, evaluated at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Statistical analysis was performed using Aggregate Data Drug Information System (ADDIS) 1.4 software, and all data were graphically summarized using Microsoft Excel software.
RESULTS: The final analysis included 11 studies, of which 6 studies compared DCB with PB, 2 studies compared PB vs LA+PB, 2 studies compared DCB vs LA+DCB, and 1 study compared LA+DCB with LA+PB. DCB was better than PB in decreasing binary restenosis at 6 (odds ratio [OR]: 0.22, 95% credible interval [CrI]: 0.04-0.91) and 12 (OR: 0.26, 95% CrI: 0.12-0.50) months. DCB was associated with lower TLR than PB at 6 months (OR: 0.31, 95% CrI: 0.13-0.69). LA+DCB was also superior to PB in treating binary restenosis at 12 months (OR: 6.10, 95% CrI: 1.94-24.41) and TLR at 6 months (OR: 5.32, 95% CrI: 1.43-28.06). There was no statistical difference in mortality between PB, DCB, and LA+PB. DCB and LA+DCB were the first 2 options for reducing binary restenosis and TLR.
CONCLUSION: The current network meta-analysis demonstrates that both DCB and LA+DCB are superior to PB alone, and that DCB and LA+DCB may be the preferred treatment options for reducing binary restenosis and TLR.
CLINICAL IMPACT: The treatment for femoropopliteal in-stent restenosis (ISR) remains challenging clinical practice. One important reason is that no optimal treatment strategy was available. Drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DCB) and laser atherectomy (LA) have been extensively utilized to treat ISR; however, different combinations of these treatments further confused the clinicians' choices. This network meta-analysis systematically investigated the difference between the currently available treatments regarding therapeutic effects and safety, indicating that DCB and LA+DCB may be the optimal treatment for decreasing the risk of binary restenosis and target lesion revascularization. The results of the current network meta-analysis help to resolve the confusion of clinicians in making the decision.
