Title: Totally Endoscopic Surgery for Repairing Sinus Venosus Atrial Septal Defect Using Double-Patch Technique on Beating Heart.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Minimally invasive cardiac surgery has not been widely applied in repairing sinus venosus atrial septal defect (SV-ASD). Most were minithoracotomy using the single-patch technique for patients with anomalous pulmonary veins (APVs) connecting to the superior vena cava-right atrium (SVC-RA) junction. It is unclear whether patients with APVs draining high to the SVC can be repaired safely and effectively through port access.
METHODS: From May 2019 to October 2022, 11 consecutive SV-ASD patients with APVs connecting high to the SVC were enrolled in this prospective study. One 12 mm port and 2 trocars (5.5 mm and 10 mm) were established. The pleural and pericardial spaces were filled with CO<sub>2</sub>. The SVC was snared just below the azygos vein. The RA incision was longitudinally extended along the SVC-RA junction to the SVC. The bovine pericardial patches were used to redirect the APV flow to the left atrium through the ASD and to enlarge the SVC and the SVC-RA junction.
RESULTS: There were no early or late deaths and no reoperations. The concomitant procedures included 5 patients (45.5%) with patent foramen ovale closure, 2 with ASD extension, and 3 with tricuspid valve repair. No endoscopic failure was recorded. The average cardiopulmonary bypass and operative times were 96 (23) min and 190 (30) min, respectively. No cases of venous stenosis or sinus node dysfunction were noted during follow-up of 16.4 Â± 12.2 months.
CONCLUSIONS: SV-ASD with the APVs draining high to the SVC could be repaired safely and effectively through port access with a double-patch technique.
