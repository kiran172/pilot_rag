Title: [Imaging risk factors for postoperative cerebral infarction in adults with ischemic Moyamoya disease].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the imaging factors associated with postoperative cerebral infarction in adult patients aged 18 and above with ischemic Moyamoya disease. Methods: The clinical data of adult patients who underwent surgeries for ischemic Moyamoya disease in the Department of Neurosurgery at Peking University International Hospital from October 2015 to October 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 239 patients, 120 were male and 119 were female, with ages ranging from 18 to 63 (41.7Â±10.3) years. A total of 239 patients(290 cases) underwent direct and indirect combined revascularization (CR).Gender, age, surgical side, preoperative transient ischemic attack (TIA), presence of old cerebral infarction, and imaging features were compared between the patients with (48 cases) and without (242 cases) cerebral infarction within 1 week after surgery. Multivariate logistic binary regression model was used to analyze the imaging risk factors of postoperative cerebral infarction. Results: Cerebral infarction occurred in 48 cases(16.5%) among the 290 CR group within 1 week after surgery. The proportion of patients with TIA, old cerebral infarction, ICA stenosis, A1 segment stenosis, M1 segment stenosis, abnormal posterior cerebral artery (PCA), and unstable compensation before CR in the cerebral infarction group was higher than that in the non-cerebral infarction group (P&lt;0.05).Preoperative TIA (OR=4.514, 95%CI: 1.920-10.611), old cerebral infarction (OR=2.856,95%CI:1.176-6.936), A1 stenosis (OR=7.027,95%CI:1.877-26.308), M1 stenosis (OR=6.968,95%CI:2.162-22.459), abnormal PCA (OR=4.114,95%CI:1.330-12.728)and unstable compensation (OR=4.488,95%CI:1.194-16.865) were risk factors for cerebral infarction after CR surgery (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusion: Among the imaging factors, TIA, old cerebral infarction, A1 stenosis, M1 stenosis, abnormal PCA and unstable compensation were risk factors for cerebral infarction in adult patients with ischemic Moyamoya disease treated by combined revascularization.
