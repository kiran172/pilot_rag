Title: Subclavian artery stenting via bilateral radial artery access: Four case reports.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Subclavian artery stenosis refers to the stenosis in the lumen caused by the presence of plaque or thrombus in the subclavian artery. It is a common problem in endovascular interventions. In fact, conventional subclavian artery stenting via the femoral artery approach is effective and safe. Nevertheless, because femoral artery puncture is not easy to stop bleeding, it requires longer femoral artery compression or more expensive hemostatic materials, such as staplers. Patients need to be catheterized and bedridden for a longer time, which may lead to many complications, such as pseudoaneurysm.
CASE SUMMARY: Herein, we reported a new interventional therapy of subclavian artery. From March 1, 2020 to August 31, 2021, we operated on four patients with subclavian artery stenting via bilateral radial artery access.
CONCLUSION: After reviewing four cases of successful placement of clavicular artery stents via bilateral radial arteries, we concluded that bilateral radial artery approach is feasible. Clavicular artery stenting is safe, effective, and timesaving. It is an excellent alternative to the traditional femoral artery procedure, with few complications and high comfort degree.
