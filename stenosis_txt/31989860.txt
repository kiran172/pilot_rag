Title: Intravascular ultrasound imaging for the optimization of dialysis access interventions.

Abstract: Intravascular ultrasound allows for detailed imaging of the dialysis access anatomy. Accurate visualization and precise measurements of the anatomy can be obtained using intravascular ultrasound, while limiting contrast usage and radiation exposure. Intravascular ultrasound allows for a true appreciation of stenosis morphology and can further guide endovascular management decisions, with a particular benefit in management of central venous lesions. Here, we describe a series of cases that together highlight the advantages of using intravascular ultrasound in the evaluation and management of dialysis access care.
