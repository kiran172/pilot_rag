Title: Thoracoabdominal Aortic Aneurysm Secondary to Aggressive Giant Cell Arteritis.

Abstract: Large artery stenosis of the arm or leg arteries or the cervical arteries has been described in giant cell arteritis (GCA); aortic involvement, nevertheless, is less frequent, even if imaging tools such as positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography have increased the frequency in the observation of aortic involvement. A 56-year-old female with a medical history of GCA presented to our emergency department with an unruptured voluminous thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm (TAAA). The fluorodeoxyglucose PET demonstrated the presence of high inflammatory activity. The patient underwent endovascular correction using a "sandwich technique." The 3-month control CT scan shows complete aneurysm exclusion. In high risk for surgery patients with GCA, the endovascular treatment with parallel stent graft of TAAA is safe and feasible.
