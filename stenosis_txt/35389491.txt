Title: A modified sutureless repair for left pulmonary vein obstruction after catheter ablation.

Abstract: A 52-year-old man presented with temporal haemoptysis and chest pain 6 months after radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. Computed tomography revealed severe stenosis in the left upper pulmonary vein (PV) and complete occlusion of the left lower PV. A modified sutureless repair of the left PV obstruction was successfully performed. This modified procedure provides a feasible, safe and effective means of treating PV obstruction, even in cases with distal extension of stenosis.
