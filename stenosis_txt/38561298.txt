Title: [The influencing factors on the spinal sagittal alignment and global balance status of degenerative thoracolumbar kyphosis].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the effect of degenerative thoracolumbar kyphosis (DTLK) on the sagittal alignment of the spine, as well as the impact on spinal parameters and imbalance secondary to thoracolumbar kyphosis. Methods: A case-control study. A total of 128 DTLK patients who aged over 50 years [thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK)&gt;15°] treated in Peking University People's Hospital from January 2018 to December 2021 (DTLK group) were retrospectively included in this study. Other 73 contemporaneous patients with lumbar spinal stenosis or disc herniation without thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK=0°±15°) were enrolled into the control group. The following parameters were obtained on spine X-ray: TLK, thoracic kyphosis (TK), lumbar lordosis (LL) and sagittal vertical axis (SVA). In addition, the osteoporosis (OP) was evaluated by dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and the L<sub>5</sub>/S<sub>1</sub> disc signal grading (Pfirrmann grading) was evaluated on MRI. Based on the age, the Lafage formula SVA=2× (age-55)+25 was used to distinguish balance/imbalance, and the DTLK patients were divided into balanced and an imbalanced group, the characteristics and influencing factors of the loss of sagittal balance in this population were clarified, and the interaction among various parts of the spine under a state of balance was analyzed too. Results: The TK (30.0°±13.5° vs 24.2°±7.4°) and TLK (26.6°±9.7° vs 6.0°±6.6°) in the DTLK group were both larger than those in control group while LL was smaller (34.4°±17.7° vs 44.2°±10.3°) (all P&lt;0.001). TK was correlated to TLK (r=0.234, P=0.008) and LL (r=0.539, P&lt;0.001) in DTLK group. LL loss was positively correlated to L<sub>5</sub>/S<sub>1</sub> disc signal reduction (r=0.253, P=0.044). LL loss [RR=1.04(1.01-1.08)] and OP [RR=3.97(1.09, 14.50)] were influencing factors for the occurrence of imbalance in DTLK patients. The influencing factors for TK in DTLK balance group were LL (β=0.572, P&lt;0.001) and age (β=0.351, P=0.045). The positive influencing factor for TK in imbalanced group is LL (β=0.209, P=0.015), and the impact is weaker than balanced group. Conclusions: Loss of LL and osteoporosis are more likely to cause imbalance and kyphosis in DTLK patients. In DTLK balance group, the proximal spine is regulated by lumbar spine, and the synergistic effect between the two parts maintains balance.
