Title: Left Coronary Ostial Obstruction by a Dislocated Sutureless Aortic Valve Prosthesis: Redo Aortic Valve Replacement with Hybrid Coronary Revascularization: A Case Report.

Abstract: Coronary ostium obstruction due to dislodgement of the prosthetic valve is a rare and life-threatening complication, and particular caution is required for sutureless aortic valve replacement (AVR) with concomitant valvular surgery. In general, coronary artery bypass surgery is performed when coronary ostium obstruction occurs after AVR, but other options may need to be considered in some cases. Herein, we present a case of coronary artery occlusion in an 82-year-old female patient who had undergone AVR and mitral valve replacement for aortic valve stenosis and mitral valve stenosis at the age of 77 years. A hybrid procedure involving redo AVR and percutaneous coronary intervention after left main coronary ostium endarterectomy was performed. To summarize, we present a case of hybrid AVR in a patient with coronary artery obstruction after AVR that was successfully managed using this method.
