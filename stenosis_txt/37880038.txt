Title: Neuraxial Anesthesia in Patients With Aortic Stenosis: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Neuraxial anesthesia (NA) has been contraindicated in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) due to concerns of sympathetic blockade and hemodynamic instability. These considerations are based on precautionary expert recommendations, supported by expected physiologic effects, but in the absence of any published scientific evidence. In light of the increasing elderly population and the prevalence of AS, this systematic review compiles available literature on NA in patients with AS to address the understanding of the anesthetic practice and safety in this population. Using a systematic approach, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies of patients with AS who exclusively received NA. Primary outcomes included intraoperative and postoperative complications. Of 1,433 citations, 61 met full-text inclusion criteria, including 3,228 patients undergoing noncardiac (n = 3,146, 97.5%), obstetric (n = 69, 2.1%), and cardiac (n = 13, 0.4%) procedures. Significant data heterogeneity (local anesthetic dosing, intraoperative interventions, and measured outcomes) prevented formal metanalysis, but descriptive data are presented. Spinal block (n = 2,856, 88.5%) and epidural anesthesia (n = 397, 12.3%) were administered most frequently. Hypotension requiring vasopressors was the most common intraoperative complication-noncardiac (n = 16, 9.9%), obstetric (n = 6, 13.0%), and cardiac (n = 1, 7.7%)-with resolution in all patients and no reported intraoperative cardiovascular collapse or mortality. The relative risk of different AS severities remains unclear, and optimal medication dosing remains elusive. The authors' data suggested that NA may not be contraindicated in carefully selected patients with AS. The authors' results should inform the design of future prospective studies comparing NA and general anesthesia in patients with AS.
