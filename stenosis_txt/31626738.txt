Title: Study of functional drug-eluting stent in promoting endothelialization and antiproliferation.

Abstract: Drug-eluting stents have been widely used in the clinic because of their impressive ability to reduce restenosis. However, the conventional biodegradable polymers used for drug-loaded coatings undergo bulk erosion, which can induce internal catalysis, resulting in a high local acidity during the degradation process and unfavorable side-effects. Herein, poly(1,3-trimethylene carbonate), a surface eroding biodegradable polymer, was chosen as a drug-loaded coating for cardiovascular stents. We modified both sides of the stent to simultaneously promote re-endothelialization at the inner layer and reduce restenosis at the outer layer, using a titanium oxide (Ti-O) film as the inner layer and a Ti-O film/drug coating as the outer layer. In vitro and in vivo results indicated that the Ti-O film accelerated endothelial cell growth and re-endothelialization, and the drug coating inhibited platelet adhesion, activation, and aggregation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and significantly reduced neointimal hyperplasia. Therefore, this novel stent may have potential as a cardiovascular stent to treat patients with coronary artery stenosis.
