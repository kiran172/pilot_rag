Title: Prevalence of Lower Extremity Arterial Disease as Measured by Low Ankle-Brachial Index in Patients with Acute Cerebral Ischemic Events.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Low ankle-brachial index (ABI) of ≤0.9 is diagnostic of lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD). It is also a strong marker of generalized atherosclerosis. The objective of this study was to assess the prevalence of low ABI in patients with acute cerebral ischemic events (ACIE): ischemic stroke (IS) or transient ischemic attack (TIA).
METHODS: We compared 150 inpatients with ACIE to 50 inpatient controls and assessed risk factors, ABI measurements, and Duplex ultrasound of the cervical vessels.
RESULTS: Low ABI was seen in 69 patients (46%) in the ACIE group and in 8 (16%) in the control group; p &lt; 0.01. The mean and median ABI values in the ACIE group were 0.88 (SD = 0.22) and 0.91 (0.24-1.33), which were significantly lower than in the control group: 1.04 (SD = 0.16) and 1.0 (0.66-1.36); p &lt; 0.0001, respectively. Coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis of ≥50% and smoking were risk factors, which were associated with significantly lower ABI in the study group; the ABI with risk factors vs. without was 0.85 vs. 0.92 (coronary artery disease); p &lt; 0.05, 0.7 vs. 0.92; (carotid stenosis) p &lt; 0.001 and 0.83 vs. 0.98; (smoking) p &lt; 0.001, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that patients with ACIE have significantly higher involvement of another vascular bed as LEAD. Coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis ≥50% and smoking were main risk factors associated with coexistence of LEAD and ACIE.
