Title: Importance of Preoperative Computed Tomography Assessment of the Membranous Septal Anatomy in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With a Balloon-Expandable Valve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac conduction disturbance (CD) is the most frequent complication following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). This study examined whether the anatomy of the membranous septum (MS) could provide useful information about the risk of CD following TAVR with a balloon-expandable valve (BEV).
METHODS AND RESULTS: Among 132 consecutive patients, 106 (mean age, 85.6±5.1 years; 75 females) were included in the study. Using preoperative CT and angiography, MS length and implantation depth (ID) were assessed. The MS length minus the prosthesis ID was calculated (∆MSID). Correlation between CD, defined as new-onset left-bundle branch block (LBBB) or the need for permanent pacemaker (PPM) within 1 week after the procedure, and MS length were evaluated. A total of 19 patients (18%) developed CD following TAVR. MS length was significantly shorter in these patients than in those without CD (5.3±1.3 vs. 6.6±1.4; P<0.001), and was the important predictor of CD (odds ratio [OR]: 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.27-0.69, P<0.001). When considering the pre- and postprocedural parameters, the ∆MSID was smaller in patients with CD (-1.7±1.5 vs. 0.8±1.9, P<0.001), and emerged as the important predictor of CD (OR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.33-0.69, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Short MS is associated with an increased risk of CD after TAVR with BEV.
