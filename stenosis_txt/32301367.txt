Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Programs: Clinical Outcomes and Developments.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a relatively recent revolutionary treatment that has now become a standard procedure for treating severe aortic stenosis. In this article, the authors review the clinical history of transcatheter aortic valve replacement, summarize the major clinical trials, and describe the evolution of the technique over time. In doing so, the authors hope to provide a clear and concise review of the history and clinical evidence behind transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
