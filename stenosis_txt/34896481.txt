Title: Concomitant Repair of Meatal Stenosis and Urethral Fistula Does Not Increase the Risk of Fistula Recurrence Post Hypospadias Surgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether meatal stenosis treated concomitantly with urethral fistula repair alters the results of fistula closure.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study, included were all children who underwent local fistula closure following hypospadias repair between 2006 and 2017. Patients who underwent reoperative urethroplasty were excluded. Data were extracted from electronic records, and missing data were supplied by telephone interviews. Characteristics of patients and fistulas were compared between children who underwent fistula closure only and those who underwent meatoplasty for meatal stenosis during the same surgery. The primary endpoint was fistula recurrence.
RESULTS: In total, 106 local repairs of urethrocutaneous fistulas were performed during the study period, and 25 of them included concomitant meatoplasty for meatal stenosis. There was no difference in terms of location, size, and number of fistulas or the number of recurrent fistulas between the 81 patients who underwent fistula closure only and the 25 who underwent concomitant meatoplasty. The fistula recurrence rate was 17 per 81 (21%) for the fistula only group and 5 per 25 (20%) for the fistula and meatoplasty group after a median follow-up of 7 and 8 years, respectively. Meatoplasty was required in a subsequent procedure in 5 of 81 in the former group vs 3 of 25 patients in the latter group.
CONCLUSION: The presence and repair of meatal stenosis does not alter the recurrence rate of urethrocutaneous fistulas repaired concomitantly following hypospadias repair.
