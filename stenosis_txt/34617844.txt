Title: Current Applications of Pediatric Abdominal Point-of-Care Ultrasound.

Abstract: Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) for pediatric abdominal symptoms has expanded in both the inpatient and outpatient settings. POCUS may be used to aid in the diagnosis of appendicitis, hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, and intussusception in the pediatric population. This article reviews the benefits of POCUS for the diagnosis of these pediatric pathologies. This article also provides instruction on how to perform these important examinations.
