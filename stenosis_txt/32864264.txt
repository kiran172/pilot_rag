Title: Pneumocephalus and Catatonia in a Patient With Persistent Drain Dysfunctions and Infections After a Hydrocephalus due to an Aquaduct Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: The combination of catatonia and pneumocephalus is very rare and literature is very scarce on this topic.Â Here, we report a patient with pneumocephalus and catatonia after persistent drain dysfunctions and infections after a hydrocephalus due to an aquaduct stenosis. The combination of a catatonic syndrome and pneumocephalus in neurosurgical and intensive care practice is a rare phenomenon. One should consider it in patients after complicated neurosurgery with pneumocephalus.
