Title: The Combined Middle and Inferior Antrostomy for Fungal Maxillary Sinusitis Treatment.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Aims: The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of the combined middle and inferior meatal antrostomy (MIMA) in management of patients with maxillary fungal sinusitis. Material and Methods: Design: retrospective cross sectional study. Setting and subjects: From September 2018 to March 2021, fifty-five patients with non-invasive maxillary fungal sinusitis, who underwent transnasal endoscopic combined MIMA. Methods: The study compared patients' pre- and post-operative subjective symptoms, including nasal obstruction, discharge, facial pain or pressure, halitosis, anosmia, and other non-specific symptoms. Endoscopic characteristics of recurrent fungal maxillary sinusitis and postoperative complications were also observed. Closure of the IMA site was evaluated at three and six months post-surgery and patients were categorized into three groups based on closure degree. Results: All clinical symptoms, including nasal discharge, nasal obstruction, nasal pruritus, anosmia, halitosis, sneezing, facial pain, ophthalmic and otologic symptoms, were resolved over six months after combined MIMA in majority of cases (94 -â€‰100%). After three and six months, the postoperative endoscopic evaluation revealed recurrent fungal maxillary sinusitis in 1.8% and 5.4% of cases, respectively. Partial stenosis of the inferior antrostomy was observed in 7.2% and 16% of cases, while complete stenosis was noted in 3.6% and 7.2% of cases after three months and six months. Conclusions: The combined MIMA is effective and has better outcomes than the medial meatal antrostomy approach alone without additional operative time.
