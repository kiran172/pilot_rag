Title: Successful implantation of leadless pacemaker in a patient with giant right atrium and tricuspid valve stenosis.

Abstract: With the steadily increasing amount of leadless pacemaker implantations performed worldwide, it has called attention to the delivery difficulty in patients with severe large right heart. Nevertheless, limited studies have reported leadless pacemaker implantation in patients with tricuspid stenosis. Here, we report the successful implantation of leadless pacemaker in a 60-year-old female patient with giant right atrium and tricuspid valve stenosis. It is highlighted that leadless pacemaker should not be discouraged even if there are tricuspid valve stenosis and giant right atrium.
