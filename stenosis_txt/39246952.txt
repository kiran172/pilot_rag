Title: Troubleshooting Vaginal Stents: A Critical Review of Common Problems and Solutions.

Abstract: This review aims to examine the use of vaginal stents in clinical practice, specifically for treating vaginal agenesis and related complications and problem associated with vaginal stents. Vaginal agenesis, also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, is a congenital disorder characterized by the uterus not developing or developing only partially. Vaginal stents are medical devices that preserve the structural integrity and patency of the vaginal canal after trauma or surgery. They play an important part in gynecological treatments such as post-radiation therapy, reconstructive surgery, and vaginal stenosis management. The review also discusses the primary applications of vaginal stents, such as preventing adhesions, healing mucosa, and maintaining patency. It also investigates frequent concerns associated with stent use, such as complications and the need for better designs. Vaginal stents are essential in a variety of therapeutic settings, providing major benefits in maintaining vaginal tissue and function. However, their use is fraught with complications, including the risk of infection, discomfort, and the possibility of inappropriate placement.
