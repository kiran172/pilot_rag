Title: [Innovations in the endovascular treatment of peripheral arterial disease].

Abstract: The cooperation of physicians, engineers and other sciences results in a steady launching of effective tools for vascular treatment, which further support the dominating position of endovascular therapy in the field of PAD. Parallel to the treatment options, non-radiation based image guidance is another area, where innovation helps to reduce radiation burden for patient and staff members without losing procedural quality and despite a growing number of radiation based procedures. Meanwhile, the available portfolio of endovascular tools allows to treat every vessel segment with results comparable to or even better then open surgery. This survey presents new techniques, tools and recently published results from related trials, which will probably have further influence on PAD treatment in the coming years.
