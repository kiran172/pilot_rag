Title: Outcomes of Visceral Arterial Reconstruction: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Aims: The study aimed to review the use of synthetic grafts (SGs) and autologous vein grafts (AVGs) in visceral arterial reconstruction (VAR) in chronic visceral ischaemia. Methods: Systematic review methodology was employed. Results: Six studies were included (218 patients and 281 vessels). Two studies had data about AVG only, 3 had data about SG only and 1 had both AVG and SG data. Three studies reported outcomes for AVG (117 patients and 132 vessels revascularized). One-year primary patency was 87% (95% CI 71%, 97%). Graft thrombosis rate was 6% (95% CI 0%, 16%). Pooled stenosis rate at one-year was 11% (95% CI 1%, 28%). The 30-day (n = 96), one-year (n = 72) and 5-year mortality (n = 30) were 0%, 0% and 12%, respectively. Four studies reported outcomes for SGs (106 patients and 147 vessels). The pooled primary patency at one year was 100% (95% CI 99%, 100%). Pooled primary 5-year patency rate was 88% (95% CI 69%, 100%). There was no graft infection in 2 of the 3 studies. Overall pooled percentage of graft thrombosis and stenosis at one year was 0%. Jimenez et al. (2002) reported one graft thrombosis at 20 months and graft stenosis in 2 patients at 46 and 49 months. Illuminati et al (2017) reported graft thrombosis in 2/24 patients at 22 and 52 months. Thirty days, one-year and 5-year mortality was 1% (95% CI 0%, 6), 7% (95% CI 0%, 20%) and 39% (95% CI 11%), respectively. Conclusion: Patency was better with SG compared with AVG. Mortality was higher in the SG group. Graft dilatation does occur with vein grafts, but in this review no intervention was found necessary. Poorly designed studies, incomplete reporting and absence of morbidity and mortality indices preclude emphatic conclusions.
