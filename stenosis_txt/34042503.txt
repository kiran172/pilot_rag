Title: Single-Incision Laparoscopic Intragastric Surgery for Gastric Submucosal Tumors Located Near the Esophagogastric Junction.

Abstract: Background: Laparoscopic local resection of the stomach for gastric submucosal tumors (SMTs) is widely accepted by surgeons. For SMTs located near the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), simple laparoscopic wedge resection is rarely performed owing to concerns of causing cardia deformities or stenosis. Single-incision laparoscopic intragastric surgery (sLIGS) has been used to treat SMTs located near the EGJ in carefully selected cases. Methods: We modified sLIGS using a subxiphoid incision. Thirteen consecutive patients with intraluminal or intramural growth type gastric SMTs located near the EGJ underwent sLIGS at our institution from July 2018 to April 2020. Results: Thirteen operations were successfully performed using sLIGS, including eight full-thickness resections and five submucosal resections. There were no conversions to an open procedure and all tumors were confirmed to have negative margins on pathology. The mean operation time was 100 ± 10 minutes (range, 85-160 minutes). The mean blood loss was 50 ± 10 mL (range, 50-100 mL). The mean length of postoperative hospital stay was 7 ± 1.5 days (6-10 days). One patient was found to have oozing of blood confirmed by gastroscopy postoperatively and recovered after stopping antiplatelet therapy. Ten cases were gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), two cases were leiomyoma, and one case was neuroendocrine neoplasm. Of the 10 GISTs, 9 were classified as low risk; 1 showed medium risk and the patient received adjuvant imatinib therapy. There were no tumor recurrences during a mean follow-up of 14 ± 4 months (range, 5-25 months). Conclusions: This modified sLIGS for the treatment of the gastric SMTs located near the EGJ is simple and safe. This can be used as an alternative treatment for gastric SMTs near the EGJ.
