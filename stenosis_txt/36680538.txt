Title: Sex-specific aortic valve calcifications in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: To study sex-specific differences in the amount and distribution of aortic valve calcification (AVC) and to correlate the AVC load with paravalvular leakage (PVL) post-transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This registry included 1801 patients undergoing TAVI with a Sapien3 or Evolut valve in two tertiary care institutions. Exclusion criteria encompassed prior aortic valve replacement, suboptimal multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) quality, and suboptimal transthoracic echocardiography images. Calcium content and distribution were derived from MDCT. In this study, the median age was 81.7 (25th-75th percentile 77.5-85.3) and 54% male. Men, compared to women, were significantly younger [81.2 (25th-75th percentile 76.5-84.5) vs. 82.4 (78.2-85.9), P â‰¤ 0.01] and had a larger annulus area [512 mm2 (25th-75th percentile 463-570) vs. 405 mm2 (365-454), P < 0.01] and higher Agatston score [2567 (25th-75th percentile 1657-3913) vs. 1615 (25th-75th percentile 905-2484), P < 0.01]. In total, 1104 patients (61%) had none-trace PVL, 648 (36%) mild PVL, and 49 (3%) moderate PVL post-TAVI. There was no difference in the occurrence of moderate PVL between men and women (3% vs. 3%, P = 0.63). Cut-off values for the Agatston score as predictor for moderate PVL based on the receiver-operating characteristic curve were 4070 (sensitivity 0.73, specificity 0.79) for men and 2341 (sensitivity 0.74, specificity 0.73) for women.
CONCLUSION: AVC is a strong predictor for moderate PVL post-TAVI. Although the AVC load in men is higher compared to women, there is no difference in the incidence of moderate PVL. Sex-specific Agatston score cut-offs to predict moderate PVL were almost double as high in men vs. women.
