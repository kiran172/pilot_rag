Title: Tracheal stenosis following endotracheal intubation in a dog.

Abstract: A 2-month-old intact female Rottweiler was presented for investigation of coughing and respiratory distress 9 d after an exploratory laparotomy for intestinal foreign body removal. Tracheal stenosis was suspected by radiography and confirmed with computed tomography (CT) and tracheoscopy. After 1 wk of medical management, clinical signs had resolved and the severity of the tracheal narrowing was markedly improved, as confirmed by radiography and tracheoscopy. Tracheal stenosis is a considerable complication of endotracheal intubation in veterinary medicine and may be medically managed, depending on the severity of the tracheal injury. Key clinical message: To our knowledge, this is the first clinical case report of tracheal stenosis resulting from endotracheal intubation in a dog and its resolution after medical management.
