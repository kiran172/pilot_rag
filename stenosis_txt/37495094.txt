Title: Outcomes of Using Balloon-Expandable Covered Stent for Percutaneous Treatment of Access-Site Vascular Injury after Transfemoral Aortic Valve Implantation: A Single Center Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Access-site vascular injury (ASVI) remains a challenge for transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Although surgery is the gold standard, endovascular therapy gains growing acceptance as primary treatment option for ASVI. The aim of this study was to analyze the safety and efficacy of covered balloon-expandable stents (BXSs) placement for ASVI after transfemoral TAVI.
METHODS: All patients treated with a covered BXS between January 2018 and December 2020 for access-site related bleeding complications following femoral TAVI were included in this single center retrospective study. Primary measure outcome of this study was the primary patency at 12 months. Technical success, limb clinical worsening and device related complications were additionally analyzed.
RESULTS: During the study period, 576 percutaneous femoral TAVIs were performed. Of these, 36 patients (6%) underwent covered stent deployment for a femoral access-site complication (19 men, median age 83 years old). Procedural success was 97%. The median follow-up was 12 months (interquartile range [IQR] = 9.7, range 0-36 months). One patient was lost to follow-up. The primary patency rates at 6 and 12 months were 100% and 95% respectively. No clinical deterioration or stent fracture was described during this period.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that covered BXS deployment is a safe and effective alternative to surgery and may be a promising option for treating ASVI after femoral TAVI.
