Title: Endotracheal metallic stent removal: A novel ABC (airway balloon collapse) technique.

Abstract: To illustrate a previously unreported method of tracheal stent removal that appears to cause less mucosal injury we present a case of a 9-year-old Down syndrome patient with a history of tracheoesophageal fistula, brought to our attention after recurrent bouts of exacerbating cough and tracheo-bronchitis. Endoscopic examination under general anesthesia noted the presence of severe tracheomalacia with inspiratory collapse, and a 10-mm balloon expandable metallic stent (BEMS) was deployed and symptomatic improvement was noted. The initial stent was then removed to consider a definitive procedure using the typical grasping fashion with an alligator forceps and expected mucosal excoriation was noted. Due to symptom recurrence, the patient underwent placement of a second BEMS stent. Initial improvement was noted followed by recurrent episodes of respiratory distress due to granulation tissue formation and stent compression and a decision to remove the stent was made. A new method of stent removal deemed ABC (airway balloon collapse) method was utilized where an expandable airway balloon is placed outside the stent between the stent and tracheal wall and then inflated to collapse the stent, facilitating easy removal.
