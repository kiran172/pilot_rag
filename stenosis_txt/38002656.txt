Title: Endocarditis after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) use is gaining momentum as the mainstay for the treatment of aortic stenosis compared to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). Unfortunately, TAVR-related infective endocarditis (TAVR-IE) is expected to be detected more and more as a result of the ever-expanding indications in younger patients. Given the overall poor prognosis of TAVR-IE, it is imperative that clinicians familiarize themselves with common presentations, major risk factors, diagnostic pitfalls, therapeutic approaches, and the prevention of TAVR-IE. Herein, we review all of the above in detail with the most updated available literature.
