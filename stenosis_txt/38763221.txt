Title: Long-term Stroke and Mortality Risk in Nonagenarians After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Insertion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Limited data exist on the long-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve insertion (TAVI) in nonagenarian patients. This study investigated the relationship between patient baseline comorbidity and frailty on the long-term outcome of the nonagenarian population.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 187 consecutive nonagenarian patients who underwent TAVI from 2009 to 2020. Multivariable models were used to analyze the association between baseline patient and frailty variables and mortality, stroke, and repeat hospitalization. Long-term survival was compared with an age- and sex-matched United States population.
RESULTS: The median Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality was 10% (interquartile range, 7%-17%). Frailty was met in 72% of patients based on the 5-meter walk test, 13% based on the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 12-item instrument score, 12% based on Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living, and 8% based on serum albumin levels. Procedure-related death occurred in 3 patients (2%) and stroke in 8 (4%). The median duration of follow-up was 3.4 years. Outcomes included death in 150 patients (80%), stroke in 15, and repeat hospitalization in 114. Multivariable analysis identified no association between any of the baseline patient variables with mortality, stroke, repeat hospitalization, or the combined outcomes (all P > .05). The 1- and 5-year survival rates in TAVI-treated nonagenarians were similar to age- and sex-matched controls (PÂ = .27).
CONCLUSIONS: Long-term death or stroke is independent of The Society of Thoracic Surgeons predicted risk of mortality and frailty risk variables in this nonagenarian patient population who received TAVI. Furthermore, survival is similar to age- and sex-matched controls.
