Title: Cluster of Differentiation 147 (CD147) serves as a promoter of atherosclerosis in patients with cerebral infarction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the correlations of cluster of differentiation 147 (CD147) with plaque stability of carotid atherosclerosis (AS), degree of stenosis, inflammatory factors, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression and vascular endothelial function in patients with cerebral infarction.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 50 patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction (cerebral infarction group), 70 patients diagnosed with AS plaque (plaque group, with no infarction but plaques only) and 30 healthy people receiving physical examination (control group) in our hospital from March 2018 to July 2019 were collected. The levels of biochemical indexes, CD147, MMP-9, vascular endothelial function indexes [endothelin-1 (ET-1) and C-reactive protein (CRP)] and inflammatory factors [interleukin-10 (IL-10), IL-16 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α)] in the blood of each group of patients were detected via radioimmunoassay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Moreover, ultrasonic examination and Gensini score system were applied to score the degree of carotid stenosis in cerebral infarction group. Finally, the differences in various parameters were compared among the three groups, and the correlations of CD147 with different indexes were evaluated using Spearman method.
RESULTS: Compared with those in control group, the levels of CD147, MMP-9, hemoglobin, platelets, total cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein A, apolipoprotein B, IL-10, IL-13 and TNF-α in the blood were remarkably elevated in cerebral infarction group and plaque group (p<0.05). Cerebral infarction group had notably higher levels of CD147, hemoglobin, triglyceride, apolipoprotein B, IL-10, IL-13 and TNF-α in the blood than plaque group (p<0.05). The plaque score was markedly higher in cerebral infarction group than that in plaque group [(3.27±2.86) points vs. (0.93±1.44) points] (p<0.05). In comparison with control group, plaque group and cerebral infarction group exhibited evidently raised levels of blood ET-1 and CRP (p<0.05). The serum CD147 level was significantly associated with MMP-9 (p=0.003, r=0.616), Gensini score (p=0.006, r=0.656), plaque score (p=0.027, r=0.396), IL-10 (p=0.004, r=0.603), TNF-α (p=0.001, r=0.746) and CRP (p=0.037, r=0.450) in cerebral infarction group.
CONCLUSIONS: CD147 level is prominently increased in carotid AS and closely related to inflammatory responses, and CD147 may become a new reference for the prediction and treatment of AS and cerebral infarction.
