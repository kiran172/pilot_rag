Title: Transcarotid TAVR for Severe Bicuspid Aortic Stenosis With Virtually Atretic Coarctation of the Thoracic Aorta.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement by alternate access sites allows for treatment of patients with unfavorable anatomy for a transfemoral approach. To our knowledge, we present the first reported case of successful transcatheter aortic valve replacement via the transcarotid approach in a 65-year-old man with a symptomatic severe bicuspid aortic valve stenosis and virtually atretic coarctation of the thoracic aorta.
