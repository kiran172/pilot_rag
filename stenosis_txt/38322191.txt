Title: Superior vena cava obstruction and cardiovascular implantable electronic devices-a new era of leadless devices.

Abstract: Cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) such as pacemakers and implantable cardioverter defibrillators require the placement of a transvenous lead through the superior vena cava (SVC), which can be difficult if there is stenosis or obstruction of the SVC. Moreover, SVC syndrome may occur after the lead is inserted even if the SVC was intact before the implantation. Therefore, there is need of an appropriate strategy for handling stenosis or obstruction of SVC during lead placement. In addition, advances are being made in CIEDs that do not require transvenous leads, and thus CIEDs without a transvenous lead should be considered depending on the indications and urgency of the particular case. This manuscript is divided into (I) device therapy for patients with SVC obstruction and (II) therapeutic strategy for SVC obstruction after lead implantation. In patients with SVC syndrome, treatment of the SVC occlusion should be based on the individual pathophysiology, and depending on the indications and urgency of the case, treatment with CIEDs that do not require transvenous leads should be considered. Further data must be accumulated to clarify the long-term prognosis of device implantation after treatment of SVC occlusion. In addition, transvenous lead extraction is now widely used for device-related SVC obstruction, and this procedure also merits further accumulation of data.
