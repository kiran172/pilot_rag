Title: Defining the Spectrum of Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).

Abstract: The 2021 International Paediatric and Congenital Cardiac Code and the Eleventh Revision of the International Classification of Diseases provide the following definition for hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS): "Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is defined as a spectrum of congenital cardiovascular malformations with normally aligned great arteries without a common atrioventricular junction, characterized by underdevelopment of the left heart with significant hypoplasia of the left ventricle including atresia, stenosis, or hypoplasia of the aortic or mitral valve, or both valves, and hypoplasia of the ascending aorta and aortic arch." Although HLHS with intact ventricular septum (HLHS + IVS) and HLHS with ventricular septal defect (HLHS + VSD) are different cardiac phenotypes, both of these lesions are part of the spectrum of HLHS.
