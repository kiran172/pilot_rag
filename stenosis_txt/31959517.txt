Title: Evaluation of a Novel Spun Polytetrafluoroethylene Stent Graft in an Ovine External Iliac Artery Model.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the patency, cellular response, and thrombogenicity of a novel vascular stent graft.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test stent grafts, incorporating luminal spun polytetrafluoroethylene and a nonpermeable fluoropolymer layer, and control stent grafts, constructed of permeable expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, were implanted in the external iliac arteries of 14 adult sheep with a median weight of 73.4 kg ranging from 60.6-86.8 kg for 30 (n = 4), 90 (n = 4), and 180 (n = 6) days. Angiographic patency and percent diameter stenosis (%DS) were assessed at termination. Excised stent grafts were fixed and stained for histopathologic analysis, including neointimal coverage (NC) assessment.
RESULTS: Test and control device migration occurred in 1 animal, resulting in test device thrombosis. Both devices were excluded from analysis. Mean %DS in test and control implants was 4.6% and 8.2% (P = .563), 2.0% and 10.9% (P = .363), and 2.1% and 10.3% (P = .009) at 30, 90, and 180 days, respectively. Median NC scores at 30, 90, and 180 days were significantly lower in middle test device sections (P < .05). Proximal and distal test and control sections exhibited similar median NC scores at all time periods (P > .05). When present, test and control devices exhibited no neointimal detachment from the graft surface. Except for the migrated test device, no thrombus was observed. Transgraft cellular migration was absent in test devices but present in control devices with tissue accumulation around the stent struts.
CONCLUSIONS: Test and control devices demonstrated excellent patency in an ovine model. Compared to the control, test devices exhibited significantly lower %DS values at 180 days and significantly lower mid-device NC scores at 30, 90, and 180 days.
