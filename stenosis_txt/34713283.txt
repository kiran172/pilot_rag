Title: Carotid artery stenosis: An approach to its diagnosis and management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is one of the major causes of acute ischaemic stroke, accounting for approximately 20% of cases. It is not always symptomatic; however, when it is, the neurological vascular territory it commonly affects is the anterior circulation of the brain, causing symptoms such as hemiplegia, dysphasia or vision loss.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to review the current literature on CAS, summarise the main updates and evidence base for surgical management, and discuss when vascular surgical input may be beneficial.
DISCUSSION: CAS can be classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic disease. Carotid endarterectomy remains important in the treatment of symptomatic disease because of a strong evidence base for its benefit in the overall reduction of recurrent stroke risk. The benefit of surgery is less clear for asymptomatic disease. Commencement of best medical therapy as well as cardiovascular risk factor modification is a mainstay of treatment for both groups of patients.
