Title: Takayasu Arteritis With Coronary Artery Involvement: Differences Between Pediatric and Adult Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The clinical features, angiographic findings, and outcomes have not been compared between pediatric and adult patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA) with coronary involvement.
METHODS: Of 1056 consecutive patients with TA hospitalized and followed from 1990 to 2018 in our hospital, 38 patients including 9 children and 29 adults (mean age at diagnosis of 14.3 ± 3.3 years and 38.6 ± 12.0 years, respectively) were diagnosed with coronary artery involvement by imaging. Clinical manifestations, coronary lesion characteristics, and outcomes were compared between the pediatric and adult patients.
RESULTS: Compared with adults, pediatric patients with TA with coronary involvement had a significantly shorter disease duration (median, 2 months; interquartile range [IQR], 1-38 vs median, 48 months [IQR, 18-90], P = 0.019) and higher disease activity score (median, 3 [IQR, 2-4] vs median, 2 [IQR, 1-3], P = 0.013) on the first positive coronary assessment. Although all recruited patients except 1 child had coronary stenosis, coronary aneurysmal dilation was found in 6 patients and was more frequent in children than in adults (55.6% vs 3.4%, P = 0.001). Moreover, the children with coronary aneurysmal dilation had a higher incidence of dilation in large vessels than children without aneurysmal dilation (80.0% vs 0%, P = 0.048).
CONCLUSION: Pediatric patients with TA with coronary involvement had higher inflammation status and were more prone to coronary aneurysmal dilation on the first positive coronary assessment compared with adults. Dilation in the aorta and its major branches might be an indicator of coronary aneurysmal dilation in these pediatric patients.
