Title: Clinical and Bronchoscopy Assessment in Diagnosing the Histopathology Type of Primary Central Lung Tumors.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The location and type of a tumor influence the prognosis of lung cancer. Primary Central Lung Tumors (PCLTs) are correlated with poor prognoses and certain histologic types. This study aimed to present a comprehensive exploration of clinical and bronchoscopic assessments for diagnosing the histopathology types of PCLTs and identified the factors associated with certain histologic types.
METHODS: This was an observational cross-sectional study of PCLTs, defined as tumors in direct contact with hilar structures or located within the inner two-thirds of the hemithorax. We gathered demographic and clinical data, as well as data on bronchoscopy assessment and histopathology type. Tumor stage, symptoms of superior vena cava syndrome, and enlargement of lymph nodes in the paratracheal and subcarinal regions were also documented.
RESULTS: Of the 895 patients, 37.87% had primary lung tumors, with 17.76% classified as PCLTs. Notably, PCLT cases exhibited a higher proportion of stage III (28.9% vs. 18.3%; p = 0.03) and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) histopathology (37.1% vs. 17.2%; p = 0.00) compared with non-PCLT cases. Bronchoscopic findings in PCLTs revealed a predilection for central airway masses (25.2%) and compressive distal airway stenosis (25.2%). Subgroup analysis of 159 PCLT cases identified 37.10% as SCC. Multivariate analysis underscored that intraluminal masses predict central SCC (odds ratio 2.075, 95% confidence interval 1.07-3.99; p = 0.028).
CONCLUSION: The proportion of stage III, SCC histopathological type, and intraluminal lesions was higher in patients with PCLT than in non-PCLT cases. The presence of intraluminal lesions can predict the histopathological type of SCC in patients with PCLTs.
