Title: First-Phase Ejection Fraction and Long-Term Survival in Patients Who Underwent Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Early recognition of deteriorating left ventricular function plays a key prognostic role in patients with aortic stenosis (AS). First-phase ejection fraction (EF1), the ejection fraction (EF) up to time of maximal contraction, has been suggested for detection of early left ventricular dysfunction in patients with AS with preserved EF. This work aims to evaluate the predictive value of EF1 for assessment of long-term survival in patients with symptomatic severe AS and preserved EF who undergo transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). We included 102 consecutive patients (median age 84 years [interquartile range 80 to 86 years]) who underwent TAVI between 2009 and 2011. Patients were retrospectively stratified into tertiles by EF1. Device success and procedural complications were defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria. Mortality data were retrieved from a computerized interface of the Israeli Ministry of Health. Baseline characteristics, co-morbidities, clinical presentation, and echocardiographic findings were similar among groups. The groups did not differ significantly regarding device success and in-hospital complications. During a potential follow-up period of >10 years, 88 patients died. Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank p = 0.017) followed by multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that EF1 predicted long-term mortality independently, either as continuous variable (hazard ratio 1.04, 95% confidence interval 1.01 to 1.07, p = 0.012) or for each decrease in tertile group (hazard ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to 1.86, p = 0.023). In conclusion, low EF1 is associated with a significant decrease in adjusted hazard for long-term survival in patients with preserved EF who undergo TAVI. Low EF1 might delineate a population at great risk who would benefit from prompt intervention.
