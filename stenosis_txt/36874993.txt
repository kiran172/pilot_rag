Title: Laparoscopic redo pyeloplasty with a buccal mucosal graft.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Redo pyeloplasty can be difficult due to scar tissue or fibrosis. Ureteral reconstruction with a buccal mucosal graft is performed safely and successfully, but most reports of ureteral reconstruction using a buccal mucosal graft are of robot-assisted surgery, with few reports of laparoscopic-assisted surgery. A case of laparoscopic-assisted redo pyeloplasty using a buccal mucosal graft is presented.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 53-year-old woman was diagnosed with ureteropelvic junction obstruction, and a double-J stent was placed to relieve backache. She visited our hospital 6 months after double-J stent placement. Three months later, laparoscopic pyeloplasty was performed. At 2 months postoperatively, anatomic stenosis occurred. Holmium laser endoureterotomy and balloon dilation were performed; however, the anatomic stenosis recurred, and laparoscopic redo pyeloplasty with a buccal mucosal graft was performed. After redo pyeloplasty, obstruction was improved, and her symptoms disappeared.
CONCLUSION: This is the first case of using a buccal mucosal graft for laparoscopic pyeloplasty in Japan.
