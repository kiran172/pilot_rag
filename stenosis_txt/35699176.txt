Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation With and Without Resheathing and Repositioning: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Abstract: Background There is a concern that resheathing/repositioning of transcatheter heart valves during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) may lead to an increased risk of periprocedural complications. We aimed to evaluate the short- and long-term impact on clinical outcomes of resheathing for repositioning of transcatheter heart valves during TAVI procedures. Methods and Results We conducted a systematic search of Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases to identify studies comparing outcomes between patients requiring resheathing/repositioning during TAVI and those who did not. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the association of resheathing compared with no resheathing with clinical outcomes after TAVI. Seven studies including 4501 participants (pooled mean age, 80.9±7.4 years; 54% women; and 1374 [30.5%] patients requiring resheathing/repositioning) were included in this study. No significant differences between the 2 groups were identified with regards to safety: 30-day mortality (n=3125; odds ratio [OR], 0.74 [95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41-1.33]; I2=0%), stroke (n=4121; OR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.74-1.62]; I2=0%), coronary obstruction (n=3000; OR, 2.35 [95% CI, 0.17-33.47]; I2=75%), major vascular complications (n=3125; OR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.66-1.33]; I2=0%), major bleeding (n=3125; OR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.94-2.01]; I2=39%), acute kidney injury (n=3495; OR, 1.30 [95% CI, 0.64-2.62]; I2=44%), and efficacy outcomes: device success (n=1196; OR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.51-1.14]; I2=0%), need for a second valve (n=3170; OR, 2.86 [95% CI, 0.96-8.48]; I2=62%), significant (moderate or higher) paravalvular leak (n=1151; OR, 1.53 [95% CI, 0.83-2.80]; I2=0%), and permanent pacemaker implantation (n=1908; OR, 1.04 [95% CI, 0.68-1.57]; I2=58%). One-year mortality was similar between groups (n=1972; OR, 1.00 [95% CI, 0.68-1.47]; I2=0%). Conclusions Resheathing of transcatheter heart valves during TAVI is associated with similar periprocedural risk compared with no resheathing in several patient-important outcomes. These data support the safety of current self-expanding transcatheter heart valves with resheathing features.
