Title: High incidence of newly diagnosed obstructive coronary artery disease regardless of chest pain detected on pre-procedural cardiac computed tomography angiography in patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) is often performed before catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation to map atrial and pulmonary anatomy. Incident coronary artery disease (CAD) may also be diagnosed during cardiac CT angiography (CTA). Our aim was to assess whether coronary CTA might be able to identify a significant proportion of patients with obstructive CAD prior to their catheter ablation procedure event, even in asymptomatic patients.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing pre-ablation coronary CTA for atrial fibrillation between 2013 and 2020 were retrospectively selected. Patients with previously diagnosed CAD were excluded. Obstructive CAD was defined as ≥50% luminal stenosis. We analyzed the relationship between obstructive CAD, any chest pain, and traditional risk factors.
RESULTS: Overall, 2321 patients [median age 63.0 (54.4-69.2), 1052/2321 (45.3%) female] underwent coronary CTA and 488/2321 (21.0%) were diagnosed with obstructive CAD. There was no difference regarding the rate of obstructive CAD in patients with any chest pain compared to patients without any chest pain [91/404 (22.5%) vs. 397/1917 (20.7%), P = 0.416, respectively). The following parameters were associated with obstructive CAD: age > 65 years [odds ratio (OR) = 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.02-3.13; P < 0.001), male sex (OR = 1.59; 95% CI, 1.28-1.98; P < 0.001), hypertension (OR = 1.40; 95% CI, 1.08-1.81; P = 0.012), diabetes (OR = 1.50; 95% CI, 1.13-1.99; P = 0.006), dyslipidaemia (OR = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.07-1.66; P = 0.011) and history of smoking (OR = 1.34; 95% CI, 1.07-1.68; P = 0.011).
CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of obstructive CAD even in patients without chest pain highlights the importance of additional coronary artery diagnostics in patients undergoing left atrial CTA awaiting catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation. These patients regardless of chest pain thus may require further risk modification to decrease their potential ischemic and thromboembolic risk.
