Title: Pharyngeal reconstruction for severe pharyngeal stenosis in Behçet's disease: a retrospective case series.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Pharyngeal scarring stenosis is a rare yet very severe complication in Behçet's disease (BD). Previously, such patients had to undergo tracheostomy for life, which seriously affected the patient's speech and swallowing function. We aim to present the effect of pharyngeal reconstructive surgeries using flaps for severe pharyngeal stenosis in BD.
METHODS: The medical history, the surgical procedures of reconstruction and the clinical outcomes of BD cases with pharyngeal stenosis were analysed. British Medical Research Council questionnaire (MRC), Chinese version of the Swallowing Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (SWQOL), the dysphagia score (DS) and the penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) based on videofluoroscopic swallowing study were used.
RESULTS: Six BD cases with pharyngeal stenosis underwent reconstructive operations. Submental island flaps and forearm free flaps were used in reconstructive procedures in three female and three male patients, respectively. All patients successfully removed the tracheotomy cannula and nasal feeding tube after reconstruction. Dyspnoea was significantly relived as MRC scores decreased from 3 (3-4) to 1 (1-2) (p=0.020, Z=-2.333). SWQOL scores were remarkably improved from 782.5 (657.0-854.0) to 826.5 (768.0-864.0) (p=0.027, Z=-2.207). There was non-significant decrease in DS (from 2.5 to 1.5, p=0.066, Z=-1.841) and increase in PAS (from 1 to 1.5, p=0.317, Z=-1.000).
CONCLUSIONS: Reconstructive surgery using flaps is an effective and safe approach to rebuild pharyngeal cavity in BD patients with severe pharyngeal stenosis, which can improve the quality of life of these patients.
