Title: [A case of Heyde's syndrome in a patient hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction].

Abstract: We here describe the case of an 84-year-old woman with a history of ischemic heart disease, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, and severe aortic stenosis, admitted to the coronary care unit of our hospital for an ST-elevation myocardial infarction secondary to in-stent thrombosis and treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention. On admission, the patient was on chronic therapy with apixaban for atrial fibrillation, and reported no history of bleeding. However, the day after the administration of the loading doses of aspirin and clopidogrel, the patient developed multiple episodes of rectal bleeding and melena, requiring blood transfusions. The endoscopic work-up was negative for bleeding lesions in the upper gastrointestinal tract and in the colon, but with a blood leakage from the ileocecal valve, prompting the diagnostic suspicion of an ileal bleeding secondary to angiodysplasia. Considering the well-known link between severe aortic stenosis and ileal angiodysplasia (i.e. Heyde's syndrome), the patient, already in the waiting list for elective transcatheter aortic valve implantation, underwent the procedure during the index hospitalization. The procedure was performed in the absence of complications and the patient was discharged with a personalized antithrombotic therapy. In the following weeks, no further episodes of bleeding were reported.
