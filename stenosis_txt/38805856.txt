Title: The hybrid (physical-computational) cardiovascular simulator to study valvular diseases.

Abstract: To better understand the impact of valvular heart disease (VHD) on the hemodynamics of the circulatory system, investigations can be carried out using a model of the cardiovascular system. In this study, a previously developed hybrid (hydro-numerical) simulator of the cardiovascular system (HCS) was adapted and used. In our HCS Björk-Shiley mechanical heart valves were used, playing the role of mitral and aortic ones. In order to simulate aortic stenosis (AS) and mitral regurgitation (MR), special mechanical devices have been developed and integrated with the HCS. The simulation results proved that the system works correctly. Namely, in the case of AS - the mean pulmonary arterial pressure was increased due to increased preload of the left ventricle and the decrease in right ventricular preload was caused by a decrease in systemic arterial pressure. The severity of AS was performed based on the transaortic pressure gradient as well as using the Gorlin and Aaslid equations. In the case of severe AS, when the mean gradient was above 40 mmHg, the aortic valve orifice area was 0.5 cm2, which is in line with ACC/AHA guidelines. For the case of MR - with increasing severity of MR, there was a decrease in the left ventricular pressure and an increase in left atrial pressure. Using mechanical heart valves to simulate VHD by the HCS can be a valuable tool for biomedical research, providing a safe and controlled environment to study and understand the pathophysiology of VHD.
