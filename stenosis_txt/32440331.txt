Title: Robotic approach to treat Median Arcuate Ligament syndrome: a case report.

Abstract: The Median Arcuate Ligament (MAL) syndrome is the symptomatic compression of the celiac trunk by the MAL and other ganglionic periaortic tissue. Despite its rarity, this condition is significant from a clinical, diagnostic and management standpoint and it is usually a diagnosis of exclusion. A 61-year-old female with history of intermittent postprandial epigastric pain was diagnosed with MAL syndrome during CT scan imaging (no other causes of pain were identified). Patient successfully underwent robotic MAL release with symptoms improvement after surgery. The robotic approach is feasible and may allow a very precise and delicate dissection with release of the MAL.
