Title: First-time surgical aortic valve replacement: nationwide trends and outcomes from The Netherlands Heart Registration.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe trends and outcomes for patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in the Netherlands.
METHODS: The Netherlands Heart Registration database was used to report the number and outcomes of isolated, primary SAVR procedures performed from 2007 to 2018 in adult patients.
RESULTS: A total of 17 142 procedures were included, of which 77.9% were performed using a biological prosthesis and 21.0% with a mechanical prosthesis. Median logistic EuroSCORE I decreased from 4.6 [interquartile range (IQR) 2.4-7.7] to 4.0 (IQR 2.6-6.0). The 120-day mortality decreased from 3.3% in 2007 to 0.7% in 2018. The median duration of follow-up was 76 months (IQR 53-111). Ten-year survival, when adjusted for age, EuroSCORE I and body surface area, was 72.4%, and adjusted 10-year freedom from reinvervention was 98.1%. Additional analysis for patients under the age of 60 showed no difference between patients treated with a biological or mechanical prosthesis in adjusted 10-year survival, 89.7% vs 91.9±%, respectively (P = 0.25), but a significant difference in adjusted 10-year freedom from reintervention, 90.0±% vs 95.9%, respectively (P < 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Between 2007 and 2018, age and risk profile of patients undergoing SAVR decreased, especially for patients treated with a biological prosthesis. The 120-day mortality decreased over time. Patients undergoing SAVR nowadays have a risk of 120-day mortality of <1% and 10-year freedom from valve-related reintervention of >95%.
