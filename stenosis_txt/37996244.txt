Title: The results of genetic analysis and clinical outcomes after stent deployment in adult patients with isolated peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis.

Abstract: The RNF213 p.Arg4810Lys mutation is closely linked to the development of PPAS. Stent deployment might be a promising treatment option, but further investigation would be warranted. https://bit.ly/40t8Gmz
