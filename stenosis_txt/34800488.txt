Title: Cardiac Operations After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is now frequently performed for severe aortic stenosis. Data regarding cardiac operations after TAVR are limited, however. Therefore, we investigated patient characteristics, operative timing and indications, and outcomes of these operations in a single-center experience.
METHODS: From January 2012 to July 2020, 59 patients (median age, 70 years) underwent cardiac operations after TAVR, 38 (64%) of which were performed in other centers. The Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) was calculated at the time of prior TAVRs and at applicable index cardiac operations.
RESULTS: From 2012 to 2018, fewer than 10 operations were performed after TAVR, but 18 were performed in 2019. The interval between prior TAVR and cardiac surgery decreased exponentially from 7 years to less than 1 year over the experience. In applicable cases (19 of 59 operations [32%]), the median STS-PROM was 5.5% (15th-85th percentiles, 3.1%-25%), and 40 (68%) were complex operations with no calculable STS-PROM. The TAVR valve was explanted in 46 (78%); 5 were isolated surgical aortic valve replacements. TAVR valve stenosis/regurgitation (34 [58%]) was the leading indication, followed by paravalvular leak in 14 (24%) and endocarditis in 10 (17%). When the TAVR valve was not explanted, mitral regurgitation was the leading indication for operation. Operative death occurred in 5 (8.5%), postoperative stroke in 2 (3.4%), and postoperative dialysis in 6 (10%).
CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac operations after TAVR are increasing, and the interval between TAVR and operation is decreasing. Most cardiac operations are complex, high-risk reoperations, and isolated aortic valve replacement is rare. These findings should be considered when TAVR is selected for low- to intermediate-risk patients, particularly with multiple cardiac pathologies not addressed by TAVR.
