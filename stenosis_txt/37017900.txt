Title: Impact of quantitative flow ratio on graft function in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.

Abstract: Recent studies showed that preoperative functional assessment with fractional flow reserve (FFR) could predict a long-term patency of arterial bypass grafts in patients with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Quantitative flow ratio (QFR) is a novel angiography-based approach to estimate FFR. This study aimed to investigate whether preoperative QFR could discriminate arterial bypass function at 1 year after surgery. The PRIDE-METAL registry was a prospective, multicenter observational study that enrolled 54 patients with multivessel coronary artery disease. By protocol, left coronary stenoses were revascularized by CABG with arterial grafts, whereas right coronary stenoses were treated with coronary stenting. Follow-up angiography at 1 year after surgery was scheduled to assess arterial graft patency. QFR was performed using index angiography by certified analysts, blinded to bypass graft function. The primary end point of this sub-study was the discriminative ability of QFR for arterial graft function, as assessed by receiver-operating characteristic curve. Among 54 patients enrolled in the PRIDE-METAL registry, index and follow-up angiography was available in 41 patients with 97 anastomoses. QFR were analyzed in 35 patients (71 anastomoses) with an analyzability of 85.5% (71/83). Five bypass grafts were found to be non-functional at 1 year. The diagnostic performance of QFR was substantial (area under the curve: 0.89; 95% confidence interval: 0.83 to 0.96) with an optimal cutoff of 0.76 to predict functionality of bypass grafts. Preoperative QFR is highly discriminative for predicting postoperative arterial graft function.Trial registration: Clinical.gov reference: NCT02894255.
