Title: Cardiac Laterality: Surgical Results of Right Atrial Isomerism.

Abstract: Right atrial isomerism (RAI) is a complex entity with varying diagnostic and treatment outcomes due to its rarity. Treatment options range from palliative to corrective surgeries, resulting in heterogeneous outcomes. The aim of this study was to analyze the results obtained after cardiac surgery in patients with RAI. A retrospective study was conducted, including patients diagnosed with RAI who underwent cardiac surgery. Their follow-up was from 1 January 2010 to 31 March 2020. Demographic characteristics and perioperative conditions were described. Thirty-eight patients were included, the median age was 4 years (IQR 2-9.2) and 57.9% were men. The main diagnoses were atrioventricular canal (63.2%) and pulmonary stenosis (55.3%). The most common surgical procedures were modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (65.8%) and total cavopulmonary connection with an extracardiac conduit fenestrated without cardiopulmonary bypass (15.9%). We did not find any factors associated with negative outcomes in these patients. The overall survival was 86.8%, with a better outcome in those who did not require reintubation (log rank, p &lt; 0.01). The survival of RAI was similar to other centers. Individuals with RAI should be evaluated rigorously to determine an adequate repair strategy, considering high morbidity and mortality.
