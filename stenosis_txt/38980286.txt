Title: Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement through a right anterior thoracotomy.

Abstract: This study elucidates the efficacy and outcomes of a minimally invasive aortic valve replacement via a right anterior mini-thoracotomy, emphasizing its potential to minimize surgical trauma and expedite recovery while maintaining procedural integrity comparable to that of a traditional full sternotomy. This video tutorial demonstrates a successful aortic valve replacement procedure using the right anterior mini-thoracotomy approach, characterized by the absence of sutureless valves and specialized instruments. The detailed surgical procedure includes specific steps to optimize visibility and access through strategic incisions and rib dislocations, adhering to "the box principle" for effective exposure of the aortic valve. This video tutorial suggests that a right anterior mini-thoracotomy is a viable, cost-effective alternative to a conventional sternotomy for aortic valve replacement, offering significant patient benefits without compromising long-term valve function or safety. The broader implications for patient selection and surgical techniques highlight the need for meticulous preoperative planning and anatomical assessment to maximize the potential of a right anterior mini-thoracotomy in clinical practice.
