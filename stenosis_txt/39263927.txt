Title: Risk factors for patients with tracheal stenosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To systematically evaluate potential risk factors for tracheal stenosis and to provide a reference for the prevention and management of patients with this condition.
METHODS: Databases were searched to identify studies of the risk factors for tracheal stenosis, from their inception to October 2023, then a meta-analysis was performed. The study was registered with PROSPERO under the registration number CRD42023428906.
RESULTS: Ten studies of a total of 2525 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that tracheotomy, diabetes, the duration of intubation, the duration of mechanical ventilation, respiratory tract infection, a high incision, and a ratio of intratracheal tube cuff diameter (C)/transverse diameter at the level of the clavicle (T) >150% were risk factors for the development of tracheal stenosis.
CONCLUSION: Measures such as shortening the duration of mechanical ventilation and intubation, reducing and avoiding tracheotomy after prolonged intubation, early tracheotomy in patients with obesity who require prolonged mechanical ventilation, appropriate choices of incision location and catheter, the maintenance of appropriate C/T, the prevention of respiratory infection, and the control of diabetes mellitus should limit the risk of tracheal stenosis.
