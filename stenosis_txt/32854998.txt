Title: Laryngology Education in Otolaryngology Residency Programs - A Pilot Study.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Laryngology is a relatively new subspecialty, and experience and training vary among residency programs. Graduated residents are expected to have training adequate to manage common laryngeal disorders, but the current adequacy of laryngology training is not known.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate resident exposure to laryngology during otolaryngology residency.
METHODS: An anonymous, web-based, multiple choice, electronic questionnaire was sent to all 125 accredited otolaryngology training programs in the United States to distribute to otolaryngology senior residents (postgraduate year [PGY]-4, PGY-5).
RESULTS: Sixty-four residents (33 PGY-4 and 31 PGY-5) responded to the survey. 85.9% had had training in strobovideolaryngoscopy. Only 7.8% of residents had had training in performing or interpreting objective voice measurements, and 26.6% had had training in performing or interpreting laryngeal electromyography. 42.2% of residents had participated in a laryngeal surgical laboratory. Only 19.4% of residents had attended a national laryngology meeting during the preceding 12 months. 92.2% of residents reported that their program had a laryngologist attending, 95.3% had a speech-language pathologist in their department, and 21.9% had a laryngology fellow. 87.5% of residents reported that they do not have to transfer any laryngeal cases to another facility. Exposure to microdirect laryngoscopy, vocal fold mass excision with microflap technique, type I thyroplasty, and subglottic stenosis repair was (100%, 92.2%, 84.4%, and 96.9%, respectively). 54.7% of residents were exposed to arytenoidectomy, and 14.1% of residents were exposed to reduction of arytenoid dislocation/subluxation. 45.3% of residents reported that they had an interest in music, 25% had an interest in singing, 14.1% had an interest in acting.
CONCLUSIONS: More comprehensive laryngeal education could be achieved during otolaryngology residency by increasing exposure to objective voice measurements, laryngeal electromyography, and laryngeal surgery, especially arytenoid procedures including dislocation/subluxation reduction and arytenoidectomy.
