Title: High lipoprotein(a) levels and mitral valve disease: A systematic review.

Abstract: AIMS: The role of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] as a possibly causal risk factor for atherosclerotic artery disease and aortic valve stenosis has been well established. However, the information available on the association between Lp(a) levels and mitral valve disease is limited and controversial. The main objective of the present study was to assess the association between Lp(a) levels and mitral valve disease.
DATA SYNTHESIS: This systematic review was performed according to PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO CRD42022379044). A literature search was performed to detect studies that evaluated the association between Lp(a) levels or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to high levels of Lp(a) and mitral valve disease, including mitral valve calcification and valve dysfunction. Eight studies including 1,011,520 individuals were considered eligible for this research. The studies that evaluated the association between Lp(a) levels and prevalent mitral valve calcification found predominantly positive results. Similar findings were reported in two studies that evaluated the SNPs related to high levels of Lp(a). Only two studies evaluated the association of Lp(a) and mitral valve dysfunction, showing contradictory results.
CONCLUSIONS: This research showed disparate results regarding the association between Lp(a) levels and mitral valve disease. The association between Lp(a) levels and mitral valve calcification seems more robust and is in line with the findings already demonstrated in aortic valve disease. New studies should be developed to clarify this topic.
