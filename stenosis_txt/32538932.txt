Title: Intradural Disc Herniation in the Lumbar Spine: A Case Report.

Abstract: Intradural disc herniation is a rare presentation of a common pathology, comprising around 0.28-0.3% of all disc herniations. It occurs when disc material related to an intervertebral disc penetrates the spinal dura and lies in an intradural extramedullary location. A 60 years old male patient presented with complaints of low back pain and right lower limb radiculopathy of 2 weeks duration. Neurological examination revealed the weakness of extensor hallucis longus and ankle dorsiflexion with diminished sensation corresponding to fourth and fifth lumbar (L4-L5) dermatome on the right side. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large sequestered fragment with intradural extensions and posterior longitudinal ligament tear. Intradural nerve root showed significant displacement with severe central canal and right lateral recess stenosis. Discectomy was performed along with the removal of the intradural extension. The postoperative course was uneventful.
