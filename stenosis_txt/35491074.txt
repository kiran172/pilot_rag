Title: Approach to the Patient with a Murmur.

Abstract: Patients with valvular heart disease may present with or without symptoms. A thorough cardiac physical examination can identify patients who require further evaluation and management. Although the utility of different cardiac findings varies widely, diastolic murmurs indicate important underlying valvular pathology requiring further investigation, typically with echocardiography. The proper examination of patients with systolic murmurs, the most common murmurs in clinical practice, is fundamental to cost-effective care. We will review the key components of the cardiac examination and findings relevant to functional murmurs, aortic stenosis, mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic regurgitation, and mitral stenosis.
