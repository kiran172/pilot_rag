Title: Hybrid Laparoscopic and Endovascular Treatment for Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome: Case Report and Review of Literature.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome is a rare cause of chronic gastrointestinal ischemia caused by compression of median arcuate ligament on the celiac trunk. A 38-year-old male presented at our institution with unspecific crampy abdominal pain. After several diagnostic examinations, he firstly underwent arcuate ligament resection by laparoscopic approach and 2 months later, he underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty with stenting of the stenotic vessel. Postoperatory and follow-up controls showed regular patency of the artery with complete relief of abdominal symptoms. We propose a review of the literature on this uncommon condition, describing different surgical approaches.
