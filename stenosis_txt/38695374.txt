Title: Evaluation of differences in expression pattern of three isoforms of the transforming growth factor beta in patients with lumbosacral stenosis.

Abstract: The study investigates molecular changes in the lumbosacral (L/S) spine's yellow ligamentum flavum during degenerative stenosis, focusing on the role of transforming growth factor beta 1-3 (TGF-β-1-3). Sixty patients with degenerative stenosis and sixty control participants underwent molecular analysis using real-time quantitative reverse transcription reaction technique (RTqPCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), Western blot, and immunohistochemical analysis (IHC). At the mRNA level, study samples showed reduced expression of TGF-β-1 and TGF-β-3, while TGF-β-2 increased by only 4%. Conversely, at the protein level, the study group exhibited significantly higher concentrations of TGF-β-1, TGF-β-2, and TGF-β-3 compared to controls. On the other hand, at the protein level, a statistically significant higher concentration of TGF-β-1 was observed (2139.33 pg/mL ± 2593.72 pg/mL vs. 252.45 pg/mL ± 83.89 pg/mL; p &lt; 0.0001), TGF-β-2 (3104.34 pg/mL ± 1192.74 pg/mL vs. 258.86 pg/mL ± 82.98 pg/mL; p &lt; 0.0001), TGF-β-3 (512.75 pg/mL ± 107.36 pg/mL vs. 55.06 pg/mL ± 9.83 pg/mL, p &lt; 0.0001) in yellow ligaments obtained from patients of the study group compared to control samples. The study did not establish a significant correlation between TGF-β-1-3 concentrations and pain severity. The findings suggest that molecular therapy aimed at restoring the normal expression pattern of TGF-β-1-3 could be a promising strategy for treating degenerative stenosis of the L/S spine. The study underscores the potential therapeutic significance of addressing molecular changes at the TGF-β isoforms level for better understanding and managing degenerative spinal conditions.
