Title: Impact of cerebral ischemic lesions on the outcome of carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: Patients with carotid artery stenosis (CAS) are commonly defined as asymptomatic or symptomatic according with their neurological conditions, however, emerging evidences suggest stratifying patients according also with the presence of cerebral ischemic lesions (CIL). In asymptomatic patients, the presence of CIL increases the risk of future neurologic event from 1% to 4% per year, leading to a stronger indication to carotid revascularization. In symptomatic patients, the presence of CIL does not seem to influence the outcome of the carotid revascularization if the volume of the lesion is small (&lt;4,000 mm3); the benefit of the revascularization is also more significant if performed within 2 weeks from the index event. However, high volume (&gt;4,000 mm3) CIL are associated in some experiences with a higher risk of carotid revascularization suggesting to delay the carotid revascularization for at least 4 weeks. As a matter of fact, the evaluation of CIL dimensions and characteristics in patients with CAS gives to the physician involved in the treatment a valuable adjunctive tool in the choice of the ideal treatment.
