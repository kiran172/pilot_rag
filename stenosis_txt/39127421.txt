Title: Acute urticaria and cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute urticaria (AU), characterized by sudden skin wheals, has been associated with various triggers. While chronic urticaria's cardiovascular comorbidities have been studied, AU's associations remain largely unexplored.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify prevalent cardiovascular comorbidities in AU patients and assess their clinical significance.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort study used data from Leumit Health Services, matching AU patients with controls. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were analyzed. Statistical analyses included Fisher's Exact Test and Mann-Whitney U test.
RESULTS: The AU group (72,851 individuals) showed no sex/ethnic distribution differences from controls (291,404 individuals). Systolic blood pressure, weight, BMI, glucose, hemoglobin A1c, C-reactive protein, eosinophil counts, total IgE levels were higher in AU (p < 0.001). Several cardiovascular comorbidities showed significant associations with AU, including valvular heart diseases (aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation, and pulmonary valve stenosis), cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation and others), deep vein thrombosis, diseases of capillaries, peripheral artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, coronary artery disease, and inflammatory heart diseases (pericarditis, heart failure, and hypertension) (p < 0.05). Medications, including antihistamines and glucocorticoids, were more prevalent in the AU group (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: This study's findings underscore the importance of recognizing cardiovascular comorbidities in AU patients and considering their implications for management. The observed associations provide insight into potential shared mechanisms between AU and cardiovascular diseases, though further research is needed to validate and expand upon these findings.
