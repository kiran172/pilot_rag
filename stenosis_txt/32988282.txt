Title: Sialendoscopy in Chronic Obstructive Sialadenitis Without Sialolithiasis: A Prospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate long-term chronic sialadenitis symptoms in patients without sialolithiasis following sialendoscopy-assisted salivary duct surgery (SASDS) compared to a control group managed conservatively.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study.
SETTING: Tertiary care center.
METHODS: Thirty-six patients (52 glands) with chronic sialadenitis without sialolithiasis completed the Chronic Obstructive Sialadenitis Symptoms (COSS) questionnaire at presentation and at 3-month time intervals thereafter for 1 year. Lower COSS scores represent lower symptom severity. We compared 27 patients who underwent SASDS to 9 control patients who elected conservative management.
RESULTS: COSS gland-specific scores from 38 SASDS-treated glands (cases) and 14 control glands were similar at baseline. At 6 to 12 months (mean, 8.4 months), the surgically treated group had significantly lower scores and a greater score reduction from baseline compared to controls (mean score change [95% confidence interval] cases: 20.7 points [15.7-25.8]; controls: 11.7 points [4.9-18.4]; P = .04). There was a significant difference in scores between the 2 groups over time (P &lt; .001). A greater proportion (72%) of cases reported partial or complete resolution of overall sialadenitis symptoms at 6 to 12 months compared to the controls (22%, P &lt; .05).
CONCLUSION: Compared to patients electing for conservative management, patients with sialadenitis without sialolithasis treated with SASDS had improved symptom scores and a greater reduction of symptom severity after 6 months. With SASDS, patients had higher rates of significant overall symptom improvement. In evaluating chronic sialadenitis, assessment at multiple time points is necessary to capture the intermittent and cyclical pattern of obstructive symptoms.
