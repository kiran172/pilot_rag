Title: Unique foetal diagnosis of aorto-pulmonary collaterals in right atrial isomerism.

Abstract: Right atrial isomerism is associated with complex cardiac malformations, particularly single-ventricle lesions; right atrial isomerism is rarely associated with aorto-pulmonary collateral arteries. We report a foetal diagnosis of right atrial isomerism, with an unbalanced atrioventricular septal defect, pulmonary stenosis, total anomalous venous drainage, and significant aorto-pulmonary collaterals diagnosed at 22 weeks' gestation.
