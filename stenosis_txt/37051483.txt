Title: Reversible 'Unstable' Abdominal Angina Caused by Ruptured Plaque of the Superior Mesenteric Artery: Clinical and Radiological Correlations.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Unstable angina, characteristic of coronary artery disease, is caused by in-situ clot formation complicating ruptured atheromatous plaque. Abdominal angina, however, usually reflects chronic mesenteric ischaemia, caused by multi-vessel stable plaques involving mesenteric arteries. Herein, we describe a patient with new-onset abdominal pain caused by a ruptured atheromatous plaque at the superior mesenteric root. The diagnosis was based on an evident reversible epigastric bruit and high-degree eccentric stenosis caused by a non-calcified atheroma. Symptoms and bruit resolved within 3 weeks on aspirin and statins with regression of the stenotic lesion. Although the condition is likely common, this is the first clear-cut report compatible with 'unstable' abdominal angina, resolved by conservative treatment.
LEARNING POINTS: Resembling unstable angina pectoris, ruptured atheromatous plaque in mesenteric vessels can develop, clinically manifested by new-onset abdominal angina.This condition may be reversible under treatment with antiplatelet medications and statins.Searching for abdominal bruit is invaluable in the assessment of unexplained abdominal pain.
