Title: Quantitative Analysis of Hemodynamic Changes in Branch Arteries Covered by Flow Diverters.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Understanding post-treatment hemodynamic alterations and their association with the patency of covered branch arteries is limited. This study aims to identify hemodynamic changes after flow diverter stenting and investigate their correlation with the patency status of covered branch arteries.
METHODS: All patients treated with pipeline embolization device for anterior cerebral artery aneurysms at our center between 2016 and 2020 were screened for inclusion. Quantitative digital subtraction angiography was used to analyze changes in hemodynamic parameters pre- and post-stenting. The patency status of covered branch arteries after stenting was categorized as either patent or flow impairment (defined as artery stenosis or occlusion).
RESULTS: A total of 71 patients, encompassing 89 covered branch arteries, were enrolled. Flow impairment was observed in 11.2% (10/89) of the branches. The mean transit time and full width at half maximum (FWHM) in covered branches were significantly prolonged post-stenting (P = .004 and .023, respectively). Flow-impaired branch arteries exhibited hemodynamic shifts contrary to those in patent branch arteries. Specifically, flow-impaired branches showed marked reductions in time to peak, FWHM, and mean transit time (decreases of 32.8%, 32.6%, and 29%, respectively; P = .006, .002, and .002, respectively). Further multivariate analysis revealed that reductions in FWHM in the branches (odds ratio = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.99, P = .007) and smoking (odds ratio = 14.5, 95% CI: 1.39-151.76, P = .026) were independent predictors of flow impairment of covered branches.
CONCLUSION: Pipeline embolization device stenting can cause a reduction in blood flow in branch arteries. Compared with patent branches, flow-impaired branches exhibit an increase in blood flow velocity after stenting. Smoking and Î”FWHM in the covered branches indicate flow impairment.
