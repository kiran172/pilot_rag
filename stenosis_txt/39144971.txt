Title: The involvement of epidural fat in ossification of the ligamentum flavum: From the perspective of exosomal proteome.

Abstract: Ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is the primary etiology of thoracic spinal stenosis. The functional properties of epidural fat (EF), an adipose tissue located in close proximity to ligamentum flavum (LF), have been scarcely investigated. The metabolic state of adipocytes significantly influences their functionality, and exosomes play a pivotal role in intercellular communication. This study aimed to investigate the role of EF-derived exosomes in OLF and characterize their protein profile by proteomics analysis. Our findings demonstrate that exosomes obtained from EF adjacent to OLF possess the ability to enhance osteogenesis of fibroblasts in vitro. Furthermore, proteomics analysis revealed metabolic dysfunction in EF adipocytes and identified lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA) as a potential mediator involved in the development of OLF. This study provides new insights into the pathogenic mechanism underlying OLF and offers a theoretical basis for preventing and treating ligament ossification.
