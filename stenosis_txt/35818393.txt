Title: Complex Post-intubation Tracheal Stenosis in Covid-19 Patients.

Abstract:  Management of tracheal complications due to endotracheal intubation in patients with coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is an important concern. This study aimed to present the  results of patients who had undergone tracheal resection and reconstruction due to COVID-19-related complex post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS). We evaluated 15 patients who underwent tracheal resection and reconstruction due to complex PITS between March 2020 and April 2021 in a single center. Seven patients (46.6%) who underwent endotracheal intubation due to the COVID-19 constituted the COVID-19 group, and the remaining 8 patients (53.4%) constituted the non-COVID-19 group. We analyzed the patients' presenting symptoms, time to onset of symptoms, radiological and bronchoscopic features of stenosis, bronchoscopic intervention history, length of the resected tracheal segment, postoperative complications, length of hospital stay, and duration of follow-up. Six of the patients (40%) were female, and 9 (60%) were male. Mean age was 43.3 ± 20.5. We found no statistically significant difference between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 PITS groups in terms of presenting symptoms, time to onset of symptoms, stenosis location, stenosis severity, length of the stenotic segment, number of bronchoscopic dilatation sessions, dilatation time intervals, length of the resected tracheal segment, postoperative complications, and length of postoperative hospital stay. Endotracheal intubation duration was longer in the COVID-19 group than non-COVID-19 group (mean ± SD: 21.0 ± 4.04, 12.0 ± 1.15 days, respectively). Tracheal resection and reconstruction can be performed safely and successfully in COVID-19 patients with complex PITS. Comprehensive preoperative examination, appropriate selection of surgery technique, and close postoperative follow-up have favorable results.
