Title: Severe ischemic gastritis caused by chronic mesenteric ischemia.

Abstract: Ischemic gastritis is a rare illness caused by localized or systemic vascular insufficiency. This condition is rarely seen in medical practice due to the vast arterial collateral blood supply to the stomach through the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery and also because other etiologies are much more frequent. The classic presentation of chronic ischemia is comprises the triad of postprandial pain, weight loss, and abdominal bruit. Intervention is indicated in symptomatic patients and endovascular treatment is an alternative to surgery in patients with high comorbidity that offers good results. We report a case of a 71-year-old female patient with severe ischemic gastritis with ulcers and bleeding caused by chronic mesenteric ischemia with occlusion of the celiac trunk and inferior mesenteric artery and critical stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery. The diagnosis was confirmed by imaging, and the patient underwent endovascular treatment. This is a rare condition that is difficult to diagnose and treat and a multidisciplinary team is needed for proper management.
