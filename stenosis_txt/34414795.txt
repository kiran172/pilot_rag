Title: Combined transabdominal-transanal surgical approach for iatrogenic rectovaginal fistula: two case reports.

Abstract: Rectovaginal fistula (RVF) is a type of anastomotic leakage that may occur after low anterior resection for rectal cancer. The repair of RVF can be challenging because of the scar tissue stenosis and incomplete obstruction. Two patients presented in our department with vaginal faecal discharge almost 7 months after the radical resection of rectal cancer. On vaginal examination, titanium nails related to the rectal surgery were found in the vaginal wall. The patients were diagnosed with RVF. Considering that RVF positions in the patients were high and might adhere to the pelvic tissue, a combined transabdominal-transanal resection and vaginal repair surgery was performed. About 3 months after surgery, both patients underwent colonic closure surgery, with consequent good recovery. A combined transabdominal-transanal approach may provide distinct advantages in surgical repair of difficult cases of RVF.
