Title: Atherogenic Dyslipidemia and Residual Vascular Risk After Stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Notwithstanding the current guideline-based management, patients with stroke retain a substantial risk of further vascular events. We aimed to assess the contribution of atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD) to this residual risk.
METHODS: This was a prospective observational study, in which 792 patients (mean age, 70.1 years; male, 60.2%) with acute ischemic stroke (n=710) or transient ischemic attack (n=82) within 1 week of onset were consecutively enrolled and followed for 1 year. AD was defined as having both elevated levels of triglycerides ≥150 mg/dL and low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) <40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women, under fasting conditions. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events, including nonfatal stroke, nonfatal acute coronary syndrome, and vascular death.
RESULTS: The prevalence of AD was 12.2%. Patients with AD more often had intracranial artery stenosis than those without (42.3% versus 24.1%; P=0.004), whereas no differences were observed in the prevalence of extracranial artery stenosis (17.7% versus 12.9%; P=0.62) or aortic plaques (33.3% versus 27.0%; P=0.87). At 1 year, patients with AD were at a greater risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (annual rate, 24.5% versus 10.6%; hazard ratio [95% CI], 2.33 [1.44-3.80]) and ischemic stroke (annual rate, 16.8% versus 8.6%; hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.84 [1.04-3.26]) than those without AD. When patients were stratified according to baseline LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) level, AD was predictive of major adverse cardiovascular events among those with LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL (n=509; annual rate, 20.5% versus 9.6%; P=0.036) as well as those with LDL-C &lt;100 mg/dL (n=283; annual rate, 38.6% versus 12.4%; P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: AD is associated with intracranial artery atherosclerosis and a high residual vascular risk after a stroke or transient ischemic attack. AD should be a promising modifiable target for secondary stroke prevention. Registration: URL: https://upload.umin.ac.jp; Unique identifier: UMIN000031913.
