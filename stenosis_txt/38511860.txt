Title: A Rare Complication of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Delayed Down Migration of a Portico Valve.

Abstract: There are some complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), which is an alternative to surgery for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis. Valve migration, an unusual but life-threatening complication of TAVR, usually occurs during or several hours after the procedure and is associated with poor outcome. Therefore, operators must be experienced in rescue treatments. Placement of a second prosthesis as a salvage strategy appears to be a safe method to avoid the need for conversion to surgery.
