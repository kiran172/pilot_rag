Title: Ipsilateral Nonstenotic Carotid Disease in Minor Ischemic Stroke: an Exploratory Analysis of The POINT Randomized Clinical Trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIM: Ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease is increasingly recognized as an etiology of ischemic stroke, however tailored treatment strategies are lacking. We aimed to examine clinical characteristics and treatment effects in patients with minor ischemic stroke associated with ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease in the Platelet Oriented Inhibition in New TIA and Minor Ischemic Stroke (POINT) trial.
METHODS: We performed an exploratory analysis of the interaction of the treatment effects of aspirin plus clopidogrel versus aspirin monotherapy, stratified by presence of ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease in patients with minor ischemic stroke in the POINT trial.
RESULTS: For this exploratory analysis, 167 patients presenting with ischemic stroke and ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease, defined as 1%-49% carotid stenosis ipsilateral to the corresponding territory of ischemic stroke, and 833 patients no carotid disease were included. Compared to patients with no carotid disease, patients with ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease were older (68.5 ± 11.3 years versus 61.3 ± 12.8 years; P < 0.001), and had a higher prevalence of hypertension (76.6% versus 59.2%, P < 0.001), ischemic heart disease (13.8% versus 5.4%, P < 0.001), and tobacco use (past: 34.1% versus 25.2%, P = 0.005; present: 27.5% versus 22.8%, P = 0.005). 5.4% of patients with ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease had recurrent ischemic stroke within 14 days. Patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy had a numerical reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke compared to patients receiving aspirin monotherapy, however the exploratory analysis was underpowered to detect a statistically significant difference in treatment effect (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.18-1.40, P = 0.19).
CONCLUSION: Patients with minor ischemic stroke and ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease had a high risk of early stroke recurrence in the POINT trial. Dual antiplatelet therapy provided a non-statistically significant reduction in recurrent ischemic stroke with no difference in safety outcomes compared to aspirin monotherapy. Further study is needed to determine if early and short duration dual antiplatelet therapy is beneficial for all patients with ipsilateral nonstenotic carotid disease.
