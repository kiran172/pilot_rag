Title: A focus on the percutaneous therapy of mitral and tricuspid regurgitation.

Abstract: While mitral stenosis of rheumatic origin has been effectively treated percutaneously for more than 20 years, transcatheter treatment of mitral (MR) and tricuspid (TR) regurgitation appears as a contemporary unmet clinical need. The advent of new transcatheter therapies offers several treatment options for elderly and frail patients at high surgical risk. MitraClip is now consolidated as a therapy for functional MR in selected patients. Transcatheter mitral valve replacement is a promising alternative to transcatheter repair, for both functional and degenerative forms. However, further developments and new evidence are needed. Transcatheter treatment of the tricuspid valve has arrived late compared to similar technologies that have been developed for the aortic and mitral valve, and is currently in its infancy. This is likely due, in part, to the previously underreported impact of TR on patient outcomes. Edge-to-edge repair is the most advanced transcatheter solution in development. Data on annuloplasty and tricuspid valve replacement are limited and more evidence is needed. The future looks promising for transcatheter mitral and tricuspid valve therapies, although their place in clinical practice has yet to be clearly defined.
