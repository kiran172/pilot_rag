Title: Association between Troponin Elevation and Decreased Myocardial Blood Flow Reserve in Patients without Obstructive Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To study the prognostic factors of patients with chest pain and without obstructive coronary artery disease is of great significance for the management of such patients. We assessed whether a high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI) is associated with prognosis in patients with chest pain and without obstructive coronary artery disease.
METHODS: From 2011 to 2017, 489 consecutively hospitalized patients with chest pain and without significant coronary artery stenosis (&lt;50%) were tested for hs-TnI and underwent stress myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE). Myocardial blood flow reserve (MBFR) was measured by stress MCE. Patients were followed (median, 41 months) for composite endpoints, including cardiovascular death and non-fatal myocardial infarction. Cox proportional hazards models were performed to determine associations between hs-TnI and the composite endpoints.
RESULTS: Among 489 patients with chest pain and without significant coronary artery stenosis, 257 patients (52.6%) had elevated hs-TnI. Compared to patients with normal hs-TnI, patients with elevated hs-TnI were older (p = 0.013) and had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.003), higher left ventricular mass index (p = 0.002) and E/e' septal (p &lt; 0.001), and a lower MBFR (p &lt; 0.001). After adjustment, there was still a significant association between hs-TnI and MBFR (odds ratio = 1.145; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.079-1.214; p &lt; 0.001). Compared with patients with normal hs-TnI, patients with elevated hs-TnI had a greater cumulative event rate (log-rank p = 0.002). Males (hazard ratio [HR], 4.770; 95% CI, 1.175-19.363; p = 0.029) and reduced MBFR (HR, 2.496; 95% CI, 1.446-4.311; p = 0.001) were risk factors associated with composite endpoints in patients with elevated hs-TnI.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chest pain and without obstructive coronary artery disease, elevated hs-TnI is associated with decreased myocardial perfusion by contrast echocardiography as well as a higher incidence of cardiovascular events.
