Title: Dissecting aortitis in a goat associated with Pasteurella multocida and Staphylococcus spp infection.

Abstract: Reports of primary cardiovascular disease in goats are rare and most commonly include ventricular septal defect, valvular endocarditis, traumatic pericarditis, ionophore poisoning and nutritional cardiomyopathies. We now report the pathological findings in a 67 kg, 6-year-old, adult female Boer goat that presented with neurological signs (ie, head pressing, unsteadiness and paddling) and hyperthermia 2 days prior to death. Lack of therapeutic response to meloxicam and penicillin‒streptomycin and poor prognosis led to euthanasia of the animal. At necropsy, the main findings included severe aortic dissection with luminal thrombosis and stenosis, and pulmonary congestion and oedema. Histological examination of the aorta revealed severe chronic granulomatous and fibrosing dissecting aortitis with mineralization. Bacterial culture of the affected aortic segment resulted in isolation of a profuse growth of Pasteurella multocida and a moderate growth of Staphylococcus spp. Histopathological findings in the central nervous system were consistent with neurolisteriosis.
