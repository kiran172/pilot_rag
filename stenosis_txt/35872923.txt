Title: Arterial Wave Reflection and Aortic Valve Stenosis: Diagnostic Challenges and Prognostic Significance.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Arterial wave reflection is an important component of the left ventricular afterload, affecting both pressure and flow to the aorta. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of wave reflection on transvalvular pressure gradients (TPG), a key parameter for the evaluation of aortic valve stenosis (AS), as well as its prognostic significance in patients with AS undergoing a transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 351 patients with AS (mean age 84 ± 6 years, 43% males) who underwent a complete hemodynamic evaluation before the TAVR. The baseline assessment included right and left heart catheterization, transthoracic echocardiography, and a thorough evaluation of the left ventricular afterload by means of wave separation analysis. The cohort was divided into quartiles according to the transit time of the backward pressure wave (BWTT). Primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1 year.
RESULTS: Early arrival of the backward pressure wave was related to lower cardiac output (Q1: 3.7 ± 0.9 lt/min vs Q4: 4.4 ± 1.0 lt/min, p &lt; 0.001) and higher aortic systolic blood pressure (Q1: 132 ± 26 mmHg vs Q4: 117 ± 26 mmHg, p &lt; 0.001). TPG was significantly related to the BWTT, patients in the arrival group exhibiting the lowest TPG (mean TPG, Q1: 37.6 ± 12.7 mmHg vs Q4: 44.8 ± 14.7 mmHg, p = 0.005) for the same aortic valve area (AVA) (Q1: 0.58 ± 0.35 cm2 vs 0.61 ± 0.22 cm2, p = 0.303). In multivariate analysis, BWTT remained an independent determinant of mean TPG (beta 0.3, p = 0.002). Moreover, the prevalence of low-flow, low-gradient AS with preserved ejection fraction was higher in patients with early arterial reflection arrival (Q1: 33.3% vs Q4: 14.9%, p = 0.033). Finally, patients with early arrival of the reflected wave (Q1) exhibited higher all-cause mortality at 1 year after the TAVR (unadjusted HR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.17-4.65, p = 0.016).
CONCLUSION: Early reflected wave arrival to the aortic root is associated with poor prognosis and significant aortic hemodynamic alterations in patients undergoing a TAVR for AS. This is related to a significant decrease in TPG for a given AVA, leading to a possible underestimation of the AS severity.
