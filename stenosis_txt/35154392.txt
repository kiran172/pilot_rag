Title: Valvular Heart Disease in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.

Abstract: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) from the early stages to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Aortic and mitral valves are the most frequently affected, leading to aortic valve and/or mitral annular calcification, which, in turn, causes either valve stenosis or regurgitation at an accelerated rate compared with the general population. Tricuspid regurgitation is also prevalent in CKD and ESRD, and haemodialysis patients are at an increasingly high risk of infective endocarditis. As for pathophysiology, several mechanisms causing VHD in CKD have been proposed, highlighting the complexity of the process. Echocardiography constitutes the gold standard for the assessment of VHD in CKD/ESRD patients, despite the progress of other imaging modalities. With regard to treatment, the existing 2017 European Society of Cardiology/European Association for Cardio-Thoracic Surgery guidelines on the management of VHD addressing patients with normal kidney function are also applied to patients with CKD/ESRD.
