Title: Distressed Communities Index in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in an Affluent County in New York.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of the distressed communities index (DCI), a composite measure of economic well-being based on the U.S. zip code, is becoming increasingly recognized. Ranging from 0 (prosperous) to 100 (distressed), DCI's association with cardiovascular outcomes remains unknown. We aimed to study the association of the DCI with presentation and outcomes in adults with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVR) in an affluent county in New York.
METHODS: The study population included 286 patients with severe symptomatic AS or degeneration of a bioprosthetic valve who underwent TAVR with a newer generation transcatheter heart valve (THV) from December 2015 to June 2018 at an academic tertiary medical center. DCI for each patient was derived from their primary residence zip code. Patients were classified into DCI deciles and then categorized into 4 groups. The primary and secondary outcomes of interest were 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality, respectively.
RESULTS: Among 286 patients studied, 26%, 28%, 28%, and 18% were categorized into DCI groups 1-4, respectively (DCI &lt;10: n = 73; DCI 10-20: n = 81; DCI 20-30: n = 80; DCI &gt;30: n = 52). Patients in group 4 were younger with worse kidney function compared to patients in groups 1 and 2. They also had smaller aortic annuli and were more likely to receive a smaller THV. No significant difference in hospital length of stay or distribution of in-hospital, 30-day, 1-year, and 3-year mortality was demonstrated.
CONCLUSIONS: While the DCI was associated with differences in the clinical and anatomic profile, it was not associated with differences in clinical outcomes in this prospective observational study of adults undergoing TAVR suggesting that access to care is the likely discriminator.
