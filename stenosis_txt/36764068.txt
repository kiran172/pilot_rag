Title: Photomodulative effects of low-level laser therapy on tracheal fenestration developed in in vivo model.

Abstract: The effect of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on variable mucosal lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract has been reported. However, the effect of LLLT on tracheostomy sites or tracheal fenestration is rarely reported. In this study, we evaluate the effect of LLLT performed using 635 nm laser light based on a cylindrical diffuser and an animal model with tracheal fenestration. An animal model of tracheal fenestration is developed by suturing the trachea to the skin after performing a vertical tracheostomy from the second to the fifth tracheal ring of Wistar rats (male, body weight 200-250 g). LLLT (spot size: 2 cm2) is conducted once daily for five days using a handheld cylindrical device. Twenty-four rats are randomly assigned to a no-therapy or LLLT group with an energy density of 20 J/cm2. Histological analysis is performed at 7 and 14 days after tracheal fenestration. Irradiation at the tracheal fenestration site with an energy density of 20 J/cm2 improves the wound healing, as shown at 2 weeks after tracheostomy. Histological analysis shows significantly decreased acute inflammation and granulation tissue, as well as better cartilage regeneration and less tracheal wall thickening. Therefore, LLLT demonstrates therapeutic potential for preventing tracheal stenosis and granuloma after tracheostomy.
