Title: Comprehensive outcomes after primary arterial switch operation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report the long-term outcomes of the arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries.
METHODS: The data of 35 patients who underwent an arterial switch operation between April 2006 and May 2021 were retrospectively examined; five had double-outlet right ventricles, three had side-by-side transposition, and 27 had d-transposition. The punch-out technique was the basic method for coronary transplantation; however, if coronary artery kinking after additional peeling was a concern, the trap-door technique was used. In aortic reconstruction, the caliber difference between the neoascending aorta and the native pulmonary artery was fixed using the pulmonary artery flap. In pulmonary reconstruction, the pulmonary artery was bilaterally exposed over the second branch.
RESULTS: The median age at operation and follow-up duration were 10.0 (8.0-12.5) days and 72.9 (40.7-139.5) months, respectively. Thirty-four patients survived, and one was lost to follow-up ([coronary transplantation]: right coronary artery, punch-out = 31, trap-door = 2; left coronary artery, punch-out = 28, trap-door = 7; [aortic regurgitation]: no-slight = 27, mild = 6, moderate = 1; [pulmonary regurgitation]: no-slight = 22, mild = 11, moderate = 1). Slight coronary bending occurred in two patients; ischemia was not observed. Catheter stent placement was performed in one of three patients with stenosis at the pulmonary artery bifurcation. Catheter balloon dilation was performed in one patient with supravalvular pulmonary stenosis. There were no cases of coronary, aortic, or pulmonary artery reoperations. The 15-year cumulative reintervention avoidance rate was 91.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: There were no deaths or reoperations during the long-term follow-up period, and arterial switch operation outcomes at our hospital were satisfactory.
