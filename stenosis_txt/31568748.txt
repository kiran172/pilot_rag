Title: Melody Valve in Aortic Position to Facilitate Mechanical Circulatory Support as a Bridge to Cardiac Transplantation.

Abstract: We report a patient with congenital heart disease and end stage heart failure after interventions for congenital heart disease resulting in aortic regurgitation that could not be treated with mechanical support to bridge to transplantation. We used a Melody valve (Medtronic Inc, Minneapolis, MN) in aortic position to achieve aortic competence to allow use of a left ventricular assist device to bridge the patient successfully to cardiac transplantation.
