Title: Surgery for aortic recoarctation in children less than 10 years old: A single-center experience in Siberia, Russia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Persistence or recurrence of stenosis is a complication of initial coarctation repair. This study aims to report short-term outcomes of surgical management of recurrent coarctation and initial repair analysis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our experience with 51 patients undergoing recoarctation surgical repair between 2008 and 2019 using antegrade cerebral perfusion (ACP) technique.
RESULTS: Surgical correction included prosthetic patch aortoplasty in 23 (45%), resection with wide end-to-end anastomosis in 15 (29%), and a tube interposition graft in 13 (25%) patients. The median age at initial correction and reintervention was 12 months and 9 years. The median interval from primary repair to reintervention was 60 months. Initial repair analysis revealed 33% of patients had initial correction in the neonatal period, 72.5% of patients were done via a left thoracotomy approach and 63% of patients had end-to-end anastomosis at initial surgery.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that surgical repair of recurrent coarctation of the aorta using ACP technique can be performed safely and with excellent results.
