Title: von Willebrand Factor Antigen, von Willebrand Factor Propeptide, and ADAMTS13 in Carotid Stenosis and Their Relationship with Cerebral Microemboli.

Abstract: BACKGROUND:  The relationship between von Willebrand factor antigen (VWF:Ag), VWF propeptide (VWFpp), VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratio, ADAMTS13 activity, and microembolic signal (MES) status in carotid stenosis is unknown.
METHODS:  This prospective, multicenter study simultaneously assessed plasma VWF:Ag levels, VWFpp levels and ADAMTS13 activity, and their relationship with MES in asymptomatic versus symptomatic moderate-to-severe (≥50-99%) carotid stenosis patients. One-hour transcranial Doppler ultrasound of the middle cerebral arteries classified patients as MES+ve or MES-ve.
RESULTS: Data from 34 asymptomatic patients were compared with 43 symptomatic patients in the "early phase" (≤4 weeks) and 37 patients in the "late phase" (≥3 months) after transient ischemic attack (TIA)/ischemic stroke. VWF:Ag levels were higher (p = 0.049) and VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratios lower (p = 0.006) in early symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients overall, and in early symptomatic versus asymptomatic MES-ve subgroups (p ≤0.02). There were no intergroup differences in VWFpp expression or ADAMTS13 activity (p ≥0.05). VWF:Ag levels and ADAMTS13 activity decreased (p ≤ 0.048) and VWFpp/VWF:Ag ratios increased (p = 0.03) in symptomatic patients followed up from the early to late phases after TIA/stroke. Although there were no differences in the proportions of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with blood group O, a combined analysis of early symptomatic and asymptomatic patients revealed lower median VWF:Ag levels in patients with blood group O versus those without blood group O (9.59 vs. 12.32 µg/mL, p = 0.035).
DISCUSSION:  VWF:Ag expression, a marker of endothelial ± platelet activation, is enhanced in recently symptomatic versus asymptomatic carotid stenosis patients, including in MES-ve patients, and decreases with ADAMTS13 activity over time following atherosclerotic TIA/ischemic stroke.
