Title: The relation of circulating cell division cycle 42 expression with Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, adhesion molecules, and biochemical indexes in coronary heart disease patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) regulates macrophage polarization, vascular inflammation, atherosclerosis progression, and modifies differentiation of T helper (Th) cells, while its potential as a biomarker in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients is still lacking. This study aimed to evaluate CDC42 expression, its correlation with Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells, adhesion molecules, and biochemical indexes in CHD patients.
METHODS: One hundred two CHD patients and 50 controls were enrolled. CDC42 expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction in all participants. In CHD patients, Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells were detected by flow cytometric analysis; meanwhile, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: CDC42 was lower in CHD patients (median (interquartile range (IQR)) = 0.431 (0.304-0.722)) than in controls (median (IQR) = 0.985 (0.572-1.760)) (p < 0.001). CDC42 was positively associated with Th2 cells (p = 0.016) and interleukin (IL)-10 (p = 0.034), but negatively correlated with Th17 cells (p < 0.001) and IL-17A (p < 0.001) in CHD patients. However, no association was found in CDC42 with Th1 cells (p = 0.199) or interferon-γ (p = 0.367) in CHD patients. Besides, CDC42 was negatively correlated with vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (p = 0.013) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (p = 0.001) in CHD patients. Additionally, CDC42 negatively associated with C-reactive protein (p < 0.001), Gensini score (p < 0.001), total cholesterol (p = 0.039), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.014), but not with other biochemical indexes (p > 0.05) in CHD patients.
CONCLUSION: CDC42 correlates with Th2 cells, Th17 cells, and adhesion molecules, also reflects inflammation, coronary stenosis degree, and cholesterol level in CHD patients.
