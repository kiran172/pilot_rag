Title: Prenatal diagnosis and postnatal outcome of anterior urethral anomalies.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Anterior urethral anomalies (AUA) which present as anterior urethral valve, stenosis or atresia, are a rare cause for congenital urinary tract obstruction. We present our AUA prenatal diagnosis case series.
METHODS: Fetuses presenting with prenatal findings suggestive for AUA according to postnatal reported clinical and imaging signs (urinary tract dilatation, dilated bladder, enlarged edematous fetal penis, dilatation of the fetal urethra and diverticula) were followed prospectively.
RESULTS: Six fetuses were diagnosed with AUA. Diagnosis was confirmed upon examination of the neonate or the abortus. All cases presented with variable degrees of urinary tract dilatation. Four fetuses who presented with additional congenital anomalies of the kidneys and urinary tract (CAKUT) developed intra-uterine or early postnatal renal failure, while two isolated AUA cases have a normal renal outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: AUA is a rare diagnosis. However, high index of suspicion and careful sonographic assessment of the male fetal urethra in cases referred for urinary tract dilatation may enable appropriate parent counseling, optimal prenatal surveillance and timed postnatal urological intervention. As in other lower urinary tract obstructions, future renal function seems to correlate with associated CAKUT, therefore close follow up throughout pregnancy and meticulous sonographic assessment is recommended.
