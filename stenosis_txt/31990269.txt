Title: Predicting Endovascular Treatment Outcomes in Acute Vertebrobasilar Artery Occlusion: A Model to Aid Patient Selection from the ASIAN KR Registry.

Abstract: Background The decision to perform endovascular treatment (EVT) for stroke related to vertebrobasilar occlusion (VBO) remains controversial. Purpose To identify preprocedural predictors of good outcomes and to develop a model to aid patient selection for VBO. Materials and Methods For this retrospective study using a Korean multicenter registry, a predictive model for good outcomes (modified Rankin scale score, 0-2) was generated based on a derivation sample of patients with VBO (January 2011-February 2016). Preprocedural parameters, including onset-to-puncture time, infarct volume, occlusion type as a surrogate marker of intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis-related occlusion or embolic occlusion (truncal-type occlusion vs branching site occlusion), and collateral status, were analyzed. Continuous variables were dichotomized based on receiver operating characteristic analysis. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to generate a predictive model. The model was internally validated with the bootstrap method and was externally validated with a single-center sample (April 2016-December 2018). Results A predictive model was generated from 71 patients (mean age, 67 years ± 11 [standard deviation]; 41 [58%] men) and was externally validated in 32 patients (mean age, 72 years ± 13; 19 [59%] men). The composite of initial DW imaging volume of less than 10 mL (odds ratio [OR], 19.3; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.0, 126.4; P = .002), onset-to-puncture time of less than 8 hours (OR, 8.7; 95% CI: 1.8, 42.0; P = .007), and branching-site occlusion (OR, 6.1; 95% CI: 1.5, 26.0; P = .01) could be used to predict good outcomes, with a median area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.77-0.95; bootstrap optimism-corrected C statistic, 0.837) in the derivation sample and 0.78 (IQR, 0.62-0.95) in the validation sample. Results failed to show an association between collateral status and outcome (P = .67). Conclusion When selecting patients with vertebrobasilar occlusion for endovascular treatment, the combination of onset-to-puncture time of less than 8 hours, initial infarct volume of less than 10 mL, and presence of branching-site occlusions is indicative of a good outcome. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.
