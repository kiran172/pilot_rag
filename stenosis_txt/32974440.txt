Title: A case report of isolated severe valve stenosis in a previous tricuspid valve repair: an integrated multimodality imaging and invasive haemodynamic evaluation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tricuspid valve (TV) stenosis is a very rare condition and the aetiology is primarily due to rheumatic disease, carcinoid disease, congenital heart disease, endocarditis, and following degeneration of biological valve prosthesis.
CASE SUMMARY: We present a 45-year-old man with a rare case of symptomatic TV stenosis (TS) in a previously isolated TV repair. A meticulous multimodality diagnostic approach is presented in order to determine the severity of the TS and to evaluate the right ventricular function.
DISCUSSION: This case report presents an integrated multimodality imaging and haemodynamic approach to evaluate and document the suspicion of development of a symptomatic significant stenosis in a previous TV repair. The initial TV repair was done without ring annuloplasty, because only the anterior leaflet was affected and bicuspidalization of the valve made it patent. In addition, minimizing the amount of implanted material was intended to minimize the risk of reinfection. The final treatment was performed as a TV replacement with insertion of a bioprosthesis.
