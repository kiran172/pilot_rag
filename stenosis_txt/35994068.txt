Title: Ross Operation in Pediatric Population: Impact of the Surgical Timing and the Native Pulmonary Diameter on the Outcome.

Abstract: Aortic valve replacement early in life may be inevitable. Ross operation, until present day, remains the favorite surgical option in pediatrics with irreparable aortic valve disease. Nonetheless, the necessity for re-operation was always its principal limitation due to aortic valve failure or homograft degeneration. We present our 25 years of experience in the pediatric population. From August 1994 until June 2018, 157 children below 18 years underwent the Ross operation. This retrospective review aims at assessing the long-term outcomes, as well as the risk factors for re-operation after Ross procedure. Median age was 10.9 years, of which seven patients were infants, 79 children, and 71 adolescents. The median follow-up time was 14 years. Hospital mortality was 0.6%. Freedom from autograft re-operation for children was 96.7% and 94.1% at 10 and 20 years, respectively; whereas for adolescents, it was 92.6% and 74.9% at 10 and 20 years. For children, freedom from homograft re-operation was 92.5%, 83.5%, and 56.2% at 10, 15, and 20 years; while for adolescents, it was 96.8%, 91.8%, and 86.7% at 10, 15, and 20 years. Homograft size (p = 0.008) and childhood (p = 0.05) were risk factors for homograft re-operation. Pulmonary valve diameter > 24 mm (p = 0.044) and adolescence (p = 0.032) were risk factors for autograft re-operation. Our experience demonstrated excellent early and late survival. While children have preferential outcomes concerning autograft re-operation, those who received a smaller homograft had a higher right-sided re-intervention incidence than adolescents. Pulmonary diameter > 24 mm at surgery was an indicator of future autograft failure.
