Title: [Ascending Colon Cancer with Radical Resection after Stent Reimplantation Due to Colonic Stent Obstruction for Palliation-A Case Report].

Abstract: Since the insurance coverage of colorectal stents for bowel obstruction due to colorectal cancer in 2012, the use of colorectal stenting for palliation has rapidly spread. We report a case of ascending colon cancer in which a colorectal stent was placed for palliation, but the stent was reimplanted due to obstruction, followed by radical resection. The patient was a 92- year-old woman who was brought to the emergency room at the age of 90 years with repeated vomiting and abdominal pain, and was diagnosed as colorectal cancer ileus caused by ascending colon cancer, and a colorectal stent was inserted. She received palliative care and had been asymptomatic for 1 year and 3 months, but due to in-stent stenosis, she had bowel obstruction and sent to emergency room, and another stent was installed. The patient had a good course, but 4 months after the second stenting, she was concerned about restenosis and referred to the department of surgery, then performed a radical resection. The indication for colorectal stents for palliative purposes should be considered on a case-by- case basis, including ADL, stage of the disease, and prognosis.
