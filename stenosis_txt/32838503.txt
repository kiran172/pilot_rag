Title: [The association between mesenteric fat hypertrophy and behavior and activity of Crohn's disease].

Abstract: Objective: Mesenteric fat hypertrophy is present in about a quarter of Crohn's disease (CD) patients and it can be easily detected by bowel ultrasound (US). The purpose of this research was to assess the correlation between mesenteric fat hypertrophy and behavior and activity of CD. Methods: A total of 89 CD patients who admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University from August 2018 to November 2019 were recruited in this study. The total CD patients were divided into two groups depending on with or without mesenteric fat hypertrophy by US tests. Crohn's disease activity index (CDAI), simplified endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD), serum inflammatory indicators and fecal calprotectin were assessed. Results: Mesenteric fat hypertrophy was significantly associated with stricturing behavior (B2, P&lt;0.01). CDAI (P=0.002) , blood platelet (P=0.001) , C-reactive protein (P=0.024) , fecal calprotectin (P=0.004) and bowel wall thickness (P&lt;0.01) in patients with mesenteric fat hypertrophy were significantly higher than those without, but not the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (P=0.110) and SES-CD (P=0.115) . Serum albumin (P=0.001) in patients with mesenteric fat hypertrophy was lower than that in patients without mesenteric fat hypertrophy. Conclusion: Mesenteric fat hypertrophy is correlated with intestinal stenosis and disease activity in patients with Crohn's disease.
