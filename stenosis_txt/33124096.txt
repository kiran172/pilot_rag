Title: Novel arterioplasty of severe left pulmonary artery stenosis using native main pulmonary artery.

Abstract: There are multiple approaches described for the repair of stenosed branch pulmonary arteries. Regardless of the technique used, restenosis is common. We describe a case of severe left pulmonary artery stenosis repaired with a novel technique using the native main pulmonary artery which was transected and turned down to create a direct anastomosis with the left pulmonary artery. This tension-free tissue to tissue anastomosis resulted in hemodynamically gratifying results with the potential for growth.
