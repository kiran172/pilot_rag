Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Dextrocardia With Situs Inversus.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is a validated therapeutic option for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Dextrocardia with total situs inversus is a rare heart condition (1 in 12,000). We present an interesting case of transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a CoreValve Evolut R (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota) through a transfemoral approach in a patient with dextrocardia and situs inversus. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
