Title: Pipeline Embolization device for intracranial aneurysms in a large Chinese cohort: factors related to aneurysm occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Pipeline Embolization Device (PED, Covidien/Medtronic) is widely used to treat intracranial aneurysms. This PED in China post-market multi-center registry study (PLUS) investigated safety and effectiveness of the PED for intracranial aneurysms in the Chinese population.
METHODS: This was a panoramic, consecutive, real-world cohort registry study. Patients treated with PED with or without coils between November 2014 and October 2019 at 14 centers in China were included, and those treated by parent vessel occlusion or other stents were excluded. Study outcomes included angiographic evaluation of aneurysm occlusion, complications, in-stent stenosis, and predictors of aneurysm occlusion. A central committee reviewed all imaging and endpoint events.
RESULTS: In total, 1171 patients with 1322 intracranial aneurysms were included. The total occlusion rate was 81.4% (787/967) at mean follow-up of 8.96 ± 7.50 months, with 77.1% (380/493) occlusion in the PED alone and 85.9% (407/474) in the PED plus coiling group. On multi-variate analysis, female sex, hyperlipidemia, vertebral aneurysms, PED plus coiling, and blood flow detained to venous phase were significant predictors of aneurysm occlusion. In posterior circulation cohort, there was no variable associated with aneurysm occlusion. In-stent stenosis predictors included current smoking and cerebral sclerosis/stenosis.
CONCLUSION: In the largest series on PED of multi-center date of China, data suggest that treatment with the flow-diverting PED in intracranial aneurysms was efficacious. The treatment of PED combined coiling and blood flow detained to venous phase after PED implant were associated with aneurysmal occlusion. The occlusion rate of vertebral aneurysms was higher than other location aneurysms.
