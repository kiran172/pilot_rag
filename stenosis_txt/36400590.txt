Title: Ureteral Complications Requiring Intervention After Kidney Transplant: A Single-Center Experience.

Abstract: The surgical aspect of kidney transplant can be the surgical technique itself or the use of reconstruction techniques in the case of a complication requiring reoperation. In our study, we examined particularly surgical techniques and reconstruction options for ureteral anastomoses. Data from patients who underwent kidney transplant from 2010 to 2020 (N = 433) were examined retrospectively at follow-up of at least 1 year. We sought an association between the type of ureteral anastomoses and parameters considered to be risk factors based on literature data. We did not note the complicated cases that solved spontaneously and only selected cases where the ureteral anastomosis complication (UAcomp) needed urologic, radiological, or surgical intervention. In a smaller group, we examined the correlation between BK polyomavirus and ureteral stenosis. A total of 9.2% (n = 40) of patients developed UAcomp, 67.5% (n = 27) of whom required reoperation. In complicated cases, the rate of primary ureteral anastomosis type was 60.0% (n = 24) ureteroneocystostomy (UNS) and 40.0% (n = 16) ureteroureterostomy (UU) (P = .184). After UNS, 7.7% (n = 17) of cases required reoperation, and this rate was 4.7% (n = 10) after UU (P = .164). After treatment of the UAcomp, 95.0% (n = 38) of the patients were discharged with a functioning graft, and 5.0% (n = 2) required graftectomy. Complications of ureteral anastomosis with appropriate interventions results in good graft function. The type of ureteral anastomosis is not significantly associated with UAcomp. It is important that the operating surgeon is well versed in UNS and UU techniques to be able to adapt to any situation, be it primary surgery or reoperation.
