Title: Ultrasound Assessment of Extracranial Carotids and Vertebral Arteries in Acute Cerebral Ischemia.

Abstract: Assessing ischemic etiology and mechanism during the acute phase of an ischemic stroke is crucial in order to tailor and monitor appropriate treatment and determine prognosis. Cervical Duplex Ultrasound (CDU) has evolved since many years as an excellent screening tool for the evaluation of extracranial vasculature. CDU has the advantages of a low cost, easily applicable, bed side examination with high temporal and spatial resolution and without exposing the patients to any significant complications. It represents an easily repeatable test that can be performed in the emergency room as a first-line examination of cervical artery pathology. CDU provides well validated estimates of the type of the atherosclerotic plaque, the degree of stenosis, as well as structural and hemodynamic information directly about extracranial vessels (e.g., subclavian steal syndrome) and indirectly about intracranial circulation. CDU may also aid the diagnosis of non-atherosclerotic lesions of vessel walls including dissections, arteritis, carotid-jugular fistulas and fibromuscular dysplasias. The present narrative review outlines all potential applications of CDU in acute stroke management and also highlights its potential therapeutic implications.
