Title: miR-34c-5p inhibited fibroblast proliferation, differentiation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in benign airway stenosis via MDMX/p53 pathway.

Abstract: Benign airway stenosis (BAS) means airway stenosis or obstruction that results from a variety of non-malignant factors, including tuberculosis, trauma, benign tumors, etc. In consideration of the currently limited research on microRNAs in BAS, this study aimed to explore the role and mechanism of miR-34c-5p in BAS. The expression of miR-34c-5p in BAS granulation tissues showed a significant down-regulation compared with the normal control group. Moreover, miR-34c-5p mimics suppressed the proliferation and differentiation of human bronchial fibroblasts (HBFs) and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBE). Conversely, miR-34c-5p inhibitors aggravated those effects. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-34c-5p can target MDMX rather than Notch1. The over-expression of MDMX can reverse the inhibiting effect of miR-34c-5p on HBFs proliferation, differentiation and EMT. Furthermore, the expressions of tumor protein (p53) and PTEN were down-regulated following the over-expression of MDMX. In addition, the expressions of PI3K and AKT showed an up-regulation. In conclusion, miR-34c-5p was down-regulated in BAS and may inhibit fibroblast proliferation differentiation and EMT in BAS via the MDMX/p53 signaling axis. These findings expand the understanding of the role of miR-34c-5p and will help develop new treatment strategies for BAS.
