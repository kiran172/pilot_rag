Title: Outcomes of urgent versus nonurgent transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of data regarding the outcomes of transcatheter valve replacement (TAVR) performed in an urgent clinical setting.
METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database years 2011-2014 was used to identify hospitalizations for TAVR in the urgent setting. Using propensity score matching, we compared patients who underwent TAVR in nonurgent versus urgent settings.
RESULTS: Among 42,154 hospitalizations in which TAVR was performed, 10,114 (24%) underwent urgent TAVR. There was an uptrend in the rate of urgent TAVR procedures (p = .001). The rates of in-hospital mortality among this group did not change during the study period (p = .713). Nonurgent TAVR was associated with lower mortality (odds ratio [OR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-0.89, p < .001) compared with urgent TAVR. Nonurgent TAVR was associated with lower incidence of cardiogenic shock (OR = 0.46; 95%CI: 0.40-0.53 p < .001), use of mechanical circulatory support devices (OR = 0.69; 95%CI: 0.59-0.82, p < .001), AKI (OR = 0.60; 95%CI: 0.56-0.64 p < .001), hemodialysis (OR = 0.67; 95%CI: 0.56-0.80 p < .001), major bleeding (OR = 0.94; 95%CI: 0.89-0.99 p = .045) and shorter length of stay (7.08 ± 6.317 vs. 12.39 ± 9.737 days, p < .001). There was no difference in acute stroke (OR = 0.96; 95%CI: 0.81-1.14, p = .636), vascular complications (OR = 1.07; 95%CI: 0.89-1.29, p = .492), and pacemaker insertions (OR = 0.92; 95%CI: 0.84-1.01, p = .067) between both groups. Among those undergoing urgent TAVR, subgroup analysis showed higher mortality in patients ≤80 years (p = .033), women (p < .001), chronic kidney disease (p = .001), heart failure (p < .001), and liver disease (p = .003).
CONCLUSION: In this large nationwide analysis, almost a quarter of TAVR procedures were performed in the urgent settings. Although urgent TAVR was associated with higher mortality and increased complications compared with nonurgent TAVR, the absolute difference in in-hospital mortality was not remarkably higher. Thus, urgent TAVR can be considered as a reasonable approach when indicated.
