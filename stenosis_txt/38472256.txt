Title: Quantitative analysis of the relationship between the myocardial bridge and the FAI of pericoronal fat on computed tomography.

Abstract: We performed this cohort study to investigate whether the myocardial bridge (MB) affects the fat attenuation index (FAI) and to determine the optimal cardiac phase to measure the volume and the FAI of pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT). The data of 300 patients who were diagnosed with MB of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery were retrospectively analyzed. All of patients were divided into the MB group and the MB with atherosclerosis group. In addition, 104 patients with negative CCTA results were enrolled as the control group. There was no significant difference between FAI values measured in systole and diastole (P > 0.05). There was no significant difference in FAI among the MB group, the MB with atherosclerosis group, and the control group (P > 0.05). In MB with atherosclerosis group, LAD stenosis degree (< 50%) (OR = 0.186, 95% CI 0.036-0.960; P = 0.045) and MB located in the distal part of LAD opening (OR = 0.880, 95% CI 0.789-0.980; P = 0.020) were protective factors of FAI value. A distance (from the LAD opening to the proximal point of the MB) of 29.85 mm had the highest predictive value for abnormal FAI [area under the curve (AUC), 0.798], with a sensitivity of 81.1% and a specificity of 74.6%.
