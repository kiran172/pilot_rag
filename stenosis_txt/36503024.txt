Title: Midterm Results of Drug-Coated Balloon Alone or Combined with Rotarex Thrombectomy Device for Treatment of Subacute Femoropopliteal Artery Thrombotic Occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This retrospective multicenter study aimed to compare the midterm results of the Rotarex rotational thrombectomy device combined with drug-coated balloon (DCB) and DCB-alone for the treatment of subacute femoropopliteal artery thrombotic occlusion.
METHODS: All patients (74, aged 70.1 ± 9.3 years) were nonrandomized and divided into 2 groups based on treatment strategy between 2018 and 2020. Intraoperative technical success (defined as <30% residual stenosis), dissection types and bailout-stenting rates were assessed. Ankle-brachial index (ABI), primary patency (PP, restenosis <50%) and freedom from clinically driven target lesion reintervention (CD-TLR) were documented at follow-up.
RESULTS: Among them, 35 patients were treated with the Rotarex catheter combined with DCB while 39 patients underwent DCB-alone. The-overall technical success rate was 100%. Patients in the Rotarex + DCB group showed lower rate of bailout stenting than those in the DCB alone group (22.9% vs. 59.0%; P = 0.01). ABI at discharge was significantly higher in both groups. Mean follow-up time was 18.5 ± 3.4 months; 62 patients completed Doppler ultrasound investigation while 12 patients were censored. According to Kaplan-Meier analysis, the estimated PP was 82.0 ± 6.7% in the Rotarex + DCB group, whereas a significantly lower rate in the DCB alone group (60.9 ± 8.3%, P = 0.04). In addition, the freedom from CD-TLR rate was 82.9 ± 6.4% in the Rotarex + DCB group and 61.5 ± 7.8% in the DCB-alone group (P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: These initial data indicate that the Rotarex thrombectomy device combined with DCB is an effective choice for the treatment of subacute femoropopliteal artery thrombotic occlusion compared to DCB-alone. The combined procedure had superior midterm results.
