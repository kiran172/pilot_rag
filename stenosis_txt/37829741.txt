Title: Factor 5 and Factor 2 heterozygous positivity and complications in living donor liver transplant donors.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Factor 2 and Factor 5 mutations are among the most common procoagulant genetic disorders and are routinely evaluated in donor preparation. Homozygous mutations are contraindicated for surgery, but heterozygous mutations cannot be said to be an impediment. We aimed to investigate the effect of heterozygous gene mutation of F2 and/or F5 on complications.
METHODS: In our study, 210 living liver donors were examined. The available data of Factor 2 and 5 heterozygous positive donors were evaluated in terms of 21 donor patients and 30 liver recipients. The heterozygous positive group and the control group were statistically compared in terms of age, gender, length of hospital stay, post-operative deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, portal vein thrombosis, bile duct stenosis and bile leakage complications, lung infection and atelectasis, and wound infection. In addition, these patients were statistically compared in terms of laboratory tests. In addition, complications in recipients implanted with mutant grafts were evaluated statistically and numerically.
RESULTS: Hospital staying was longer statistically in the donor group with heterozygous mutations than in the control group. Hemoglobin and albumin blood levels were lower (p=0.031, p=0.016); INR and ALT levels were higher (p=0.005, p=0.047) statistically in the control group than in the donor group with heterozygous mutations. There was no statistically significant difference between heterozygous mutant groups in terms of biliary tract complications and hepatic vessel thrombosis in recipients.
CONCLUSION: Considering the longer hospital stay in the presence of these mutations, the increased need for treatment in this process and the close follow-up of liver functions should be considered.
