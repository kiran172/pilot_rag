Title: Recurrent pneumonia post atrial fibrillation ablation: do not forget to look for pulmonary vein stenosis.

Abstract: A man in his 50s presented with persistent chest pain, haemoptysis, cough and dyspnoea 5 months after undergoing catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). Several chest CT scans suggested pneumonia. Despite adequate treatment for recurrent pneumonia, symptoms persisted. While reviewing the initial chest CT, a partial venous infarction of the left lower lobe associated with severe left inferior pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) was diagnosed. Stenting of the left inferior pulmonary vein with a vascular bare metal stent was performed, guided by fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography. Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin/clopidogrel) was introduced for 3 months, followed by long-term aspirin monotherapy. The treatment resulted in relief of his symptoms and the resolution of pulmonary opacities on chest CT. Despite low frequency, AF ablation remains the most common cause of acquired PVS. As highlighted in this case, symptoms are not specific and include recurrent pulmonary infection with delayed management.
