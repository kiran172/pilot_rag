Title: Intracranial and Extracranial Evaluation.

Abstract: The vascular lab is an essential tool in diagnosing intracranial and extracranial disease including vasospasm from subarachnoid hemorrhage and carotid artery stenosis in the setting of stroke or transient ischemic attack. This article discusses the indications, protocol, and diagnostic criteria for transcranial doppler (TCD) and carotid artery duplex ultrasound. Intracranial and extracranial arterial testing by way of TCD and carotid imaging carries enormous implications and can provide life or death information. The learning curve for these techniques is steep but can be mastered with repetition and precise technique.
