Title: Confirmation of Aortic Stenosis Severity in Case of Discordance Between Aortic Valve Area and Gradient.

Abstract: In this report, we illustrate the different flow-gradient patterns of aortic stenosis associated with discordant grading of stenosis severity at transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The discordance among TTE parameters (mean gradient and aortic area) can be reconciled and true severity can be confirmed by ruling out potential measurements errors and by using multimodality imaging. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
