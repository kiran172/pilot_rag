Title: Aortic Involvement in Disseminated Tuberculosis - Challenges Beyond the Diagnosis.

Abstract: Tuberculous aortitis (TA) is a rare disease with a high mortality rate. Aortic pseudoaneurysm is the most common vascular pattern of TA, and isolated arterial wall thickening and arterial stenosis can also be seen in TA. We report two cases of disseminated tuberculosis involving the aorta with clinical improvement after treatment. One patient who had an aortic ulcer and intermural hematoma received anti-tuberculosis along with steroids therapy. The other patient, who developed a tubercular abdominal aortic pseudoaneurysm during anti-tuberculosis therapy, successfully received endovascular stent implantation. Clinicians should be aware that TA should be considered in patients with aortitis and active tuberculosis.
