Title: Comparative Analysis of TAVR (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) and Surgical Valve Replacement for Low-Risk Patients.

Abstract: "Aortic stenosis" (AS) refers to a cardiac condition in which the aortic valve narrows, creating an obstruction that hinders the flow of blood from the left ventricle to the aorta. This contraction of the arteries influences normal blood circulation, leading to elevated pressure within the left ventricle and potentially culminating in heart failure. The management of AS typically involves two primary treatments, i.e. "surgical aortic valve replacement" (SAVR) and "transcatheter aortic valve replacement" (TAVR). In both cases, the goal is to replace a dysfunctional aortic valve with a functional substitute. Presently, TAVR has gained much preference over SAVR in clinical practice. However, there is a dearth of comprehensive research directly comparing the real-world outcomes of TAVR and SAVR. In recent years, TAVR has emerged as an attractive alternative to SAVR, yet studies that provide a detailed comparison of their real-world solutions are limited. This review article assesses the mortality of patients who underwent TAVR vis-a-vis patients who underwent SAVR.
