Title: TAVR for Severe Aortic Valve Stenosis with LVOT Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has been recently indicated for the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis in all risk profiles. At present, TAVR has become mature at home and abroad, but the relevant experience is deficient in the treatment of aortic valve stenosis with outflow tract stenosis. One case of a high-risk surgical patient was included in this paper who suffered from severe aortic valve stenosis with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) stenosis. In this case, TAVR was performed with deep implantation of a new valve and both aortic valve stenosis and LVOT stenosis were treated through a single TAVR procedure. This case highlights the vital role of such treatment in dealing with both aortic valve stenosis and LVOT stenosis through a single TAVR procedure, thus providing valuable information for similar cases.
