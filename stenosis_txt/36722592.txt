Title: Concomitant transcatheter transfemoral double native valve replacement for severe aortic stenosis and severe mitral stenosis with mitral annular calcification.

Abstract: Concomitant mitral and aortic valve stenosis in a patient with mitral annular calcification and porcelain aorta poses a unique problem to the surgical team. Transcatheter aortic and mitral valve replacements in native valves offer a viable option for such selected group of patients. We present the case of a 54-year-old male who presented with severe aortic stenosis (AS) and severe mitral stenosis (MS) but was deemed high risk for surgery owing to intense calcification of the aorta and mitral annular calcification, and successfully underwent transcatheter double native valve replacement.
