Title: Empagliflozin in children with glycogen storage disease-associated inflammatory bowel disease: a prospective, single-arm, open-label clinical trial.

Abstract: Glycogen storage disease type Ib (GSD-Ib) is a rare inborn error of glycogen metabolism caused by mutations in SLC37A4. Patients with GSD-Ib are at high risk of developing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We evaluated the efficacy of empagliflozin, a renal sodium‒glucose cotransporter protein 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, on colonic mucosal healing in patients with GSD-associated IBD. A prospective, single-arm, open-label clinical trial enrolled eight patients with GSD-associated IBD from Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital in China from July 1, 2022 through December 31, 2023. Eight patients were enrolled with a mean age of 10.34 ± 2.61 years. Four male and four female. The endoscopic features included deep and large circular ulcers, inflammatory hyperplasia, obstruction and stenosis. The SES-CD score significantly decreased at week 48 compared with before empagliflozin. Six patients completed 48 weeks of empagliflozin therapy and endoscopy showed significant improvement or healing of mucosal ulcers, inflammatory hyperplasia, stenosis, and obstruction. One patient had severe sweating that required rehydration and developed a urinary tract infection. No serious or life-threatening adverse events. This study suggested that empagliflozin may promote colonic mucosal healing and reduce hyperplasia, stenosis, and obstruction in children with GSD-associated IBD.
