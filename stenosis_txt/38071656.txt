Title: Innovated surgery incision for patients of congenital malformation of the middle and outer ear with infection (CMMOEI).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: It is the challenging clinical issue of combining debridement of infected lesions and retaining the blood skin flap for auricle reconstruction in patients of Congenital Malformation of the Middle and Outer Ear with Infection (CMMOEI).
AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To innovate and introduce an surgery incision to solve the challenging clinical issue of a combined debridement of infection yet retaining a well vascularized skin flap for auricle reconstruction in patients with CMMOEI.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A combined innovated incision of ear sulcus and prefabricated earlobe was used for 23 cases (23 ears) with CMMOEI, The success in the management of the encountered infections, and the short and moderate-term outcome of the innovated incision to preserve a well-vascularized skin flap for subsequent auricle reconstruction were reviewed. The 23 cases include 10 males and 13 females, aged 4-14 years (mean 8.4 years), 7 left ears and 16 right ears. 14 ears stenosis and 9 ears atresia of the outer ear canals.
RESULTS: In all 23 cases, the infections were successfully cleared without recurrence or complication with 2-year follow-up. The local skin flap and its blood supply were well preserved for subsequent auricle reconstruction.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The new incision can facilitate clearance of infection in CMOMEI patients, and preserve the retroauricular tissues for subsequent harvesting of a well-vascularized skin flap for subsequent auricle reconstruction.
