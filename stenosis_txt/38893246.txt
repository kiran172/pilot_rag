Title: Dose-Escalated Radiotherapy for Primary Tracheobronchial Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma.

Abstract: Primary tracheobronchial adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy, so the optimal radiotherapy (RT) dose remains unestablished. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of dose-escalated RT for primary tracheobronchial ACC. We retrospectively reviewed 48 patients who had undergone definitive or postoperative RT. Patients classified into the low- and high-dose groups received RT doses &lt;70.0 and â‰¥70.0 Gy in EQD2, respectively. The primary endpoint was freedom from local progression (FFLP) and overall survival (OS). Throughout the follow-up period, seven patients (14.6%) experienced local progression, while 31 (64.6%) exhibited distant metastasis, most commonly in the lungs. In total, the 5-year FFLP and OS rates were 85.7 and 84.7%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that regional lymph node metastasis at diagnosis and receipt of definitive RT were associated with poorer OS. In the subgroup analysis, the definitive RT group had a 5-year FFLP rate of 33.3 and 78.2% in the low- and high-dose groups (p = 0.065), whereas 5-year OS rates were 66.7 and 79.0%, respectively (p = 0.022). Four patients (8.3%) experienced Grade 3 toxicity with tracheal or main bronchus stenosis. Dose-escalated RT with conventional fractionation may be effective in patients with tracheobronchial ACC, especially for a definitive aim.
