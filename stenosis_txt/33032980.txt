Title: Magnetic resonance lymphangiography: with or without contrast?

Abstract: Lymphedema is an important medical issue around the world, caused by an anomalous collection of fluid in soft tissue due to congenital malformations or stenosis or obstruction of lymphatic vessels. Magnetic resonance lymphangiography (MRL) is an emerging technique focused on noninvasive or minimally invasive imaging of lymphatics with the goal to diagnose and treat lymphedema. This review will briefly discuss lymphatic imaging starting with lymphography and radionuclide lymphoscintigraphy up to the newest methods, focusing on MRL, a rising technique, and highlighting the technical aspects fundamental for achieving high-resolution MRL.
