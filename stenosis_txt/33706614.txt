Title: Outcome of tibio-saphanous arteriovenous fistula in patients with failed upper extremity dialysis access: A report of two cases.

Abstract: Arteriovenous fistulas (AVF) are the preferred access for hemodialysis in patient with end stage renal disease. Usually, distal vessels of upper limb are preferred. There are situations in which the upper limb cannot be a site for AVFs or graft as in cases of bilateral central venous stenosis or with exhausted sites in upper limb. In these cases, lower limb AVF can be considered. Tibial-saphanous (ankle) fistula should be the preferred site over femoral AVF/graft following the principle of distal to proximal. Also, femoral AVFs are associated with more ischemic and infective complications. The present report describes successful hemodialysis in two patients with tibial-saphanous fistula a site rarely used as an option for HD access. Hemodialysis for over 1 year in one patient and 6 months in the other portrays the success of this approach.
