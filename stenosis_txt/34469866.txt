Title: Experimental animal models for the study of moyamoya disease.

Abstract: Moyamoya disease is a rare disorder of the cerebrovascular system affecting individuals in a bimodal age distribution and is characterized by progressive vascular stenosis of the bilateral supraclinoid internal carotid arteries with compensatory formation of collateral vessels at the base of the brain. Despite the disease's initial description in the literature in 1957, little progress has been made in the development of medical and surgical therapeutics due to, in no small part, the lack of effective experimental animal models. Currently, there is a poor understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms behind the development of the moyamoya vasculopathies. Since the description of a genetic association between moyamoya disease, few studies have investigated the impact of genetic manipulation on the development of an animal model for experimentation. To date, no one model recapitulates the precise phenotype of the moyamoya vasculopathies, although development of an appropriate model would allow for an in-depth investigation into the pathological mechanisms underlying the disease. In this review, the authors discuss the immunological, mechanical, and genetic methods used to develop moyamoya experimental models, as well as future perspectives.
