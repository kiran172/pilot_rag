Title: Endoureterotomy with the Lovaco technique for treatment of ureterointestinal strictures: outcomes in an experienced center and factors associated with procedural success or failure.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The study aimed to present the outcomes of an endoureterotomy series using the Lovaco technique for the treatment of ureterointestinal strictures. Factors influencing the success or failure of this technique were also determined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected from all endoureterotomies for ureterointestinal strictures performed in a single-center between 2017 and 2020. Clinical variables and characteristics of the stricture were recorded in each case, and success was defined as the complete resolution of ureterohydronephrosis. Univariate analysis was used to correlate the variables recorded with procedural success or failure.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were recruited: 16 with strictures on the left side, 5 on the right, and 4 bilateral. With the first endoureterotomy, 52% of the cases (13 patients) were resolved, and in patients undergoing a second intervention 64% success (16 patients) was achieved. Infectious complications occurred in 23.3% of surgeries. Stricture length, poor renal function, and left side involvement were associated with endoureterotomy failure.
CONCLUSIONS: Endoureterotomy with the Lovaco technique is a useful method in the setting of ureterointestinal strictures, achieving complete resolution of the obstruction in more than 60% of cases. Factors that can negatively affect the success of the procedure include stricture length, poor renal function, and left side involvement.
