Title: Surgical coronary angioplasty of both coronary ostia after chest radiotherapy. Is it good alternative to conventional coronary bypass surgery?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Isolated coronary ostial stenosis of both ostia is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition, occurring in 0.1%-0.2% of patients undergoing coronary angiography.
CASE REPORT: We present a case of a 69-year-old woman with a past medical history of breast cancer, who had been treated with radiotherapy, which most likely caused significant stenosis of both coronary ostia and likely accelerated aortic stenosis. Surgical angioplasty with autopericardium patch reconstruction of the left main coronary artery and right coronary arteries due to proximal stenotic disease was performed instead of venous or arterial bypasses with concomitant aortic valve replacement. The postoperative course was uneventful. There were no cardiovascular events 5Â years after operation, and the patient remained free of any symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical coronary angioplasty offers an alternative to conventional coronary artery bypass grafting in isolated coronary ostial lesions and is advantageous in restoring more physiological myocardial perfusion, especially in those cases when conduits are suspected to be fibrotic, scarred or stenosed after radiation therapy or if there is the need to preserve conduits for future myocardial revascularisation in young patients.
