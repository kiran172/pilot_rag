Title: Endovascular management of left ventricular assist device outflow graft stenosis.

Abstract: Stenosis of left ventricular assist devices has traditionally required open operative management with device revision or replacement; however, endovascular therapy is emerging as an alternative to open surgery. Limited by the rarity of this approach, consensus is lacking regarding the optimal technique. In this publication, we present a case report of outflow graft stenosis managed with endovascular treatment and discuss technical considerations including preoperative planning, stent selection, and procedural adjuncts.
