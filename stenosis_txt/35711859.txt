Title: Pyloric Stenosis: A Rare Manifestation of Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: We are presenting a rare case of pyloric stenosis due to Crohn's disease. A 53-year-old woman with prior history of colonic Crohn's disease was admitted to the hospital with gastric outlet obstruction. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy demonstrated pyloric stenosis and biopsy was consistent with Crohn's disease. She was treated with corticosteroids and her condition improved.
