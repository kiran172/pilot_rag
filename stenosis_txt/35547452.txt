Title: Renovascular Compression by the Diaphragmatic Crus: A Case Report.

Abstract: Renovascular hypertension (RVHT) is among the most prevalent causes of treatment-resistant hypertension. Mostly it is caused by renal artery stenosis (RAS). With atherosclerosis being the most common cause of RAS, RAS due to external compression by the diaphragmatic crus is rare. The treatment of rare causes requires individualization due to the differences between their etiologies. Herein, we present a case of an 18-year-old patient presenting with high blood pressure readings. On follow-up, he was diagnosed with hypertension. On further evaluation, the right diaphragmatic crus compressed the right renal artery. This case emphasizes medical management in patients with hypertension secondary to diaphragmatic crus compression, and radiological findings in such cases.
