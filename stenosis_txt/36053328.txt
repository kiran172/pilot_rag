Title: Laparoscopic versus open repair of congenital duodenal obstruction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of laparoscopic versus open repair of congenital duodenal obstruction (CDO), we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis (CDO).
METHODS: A literature search was conducted to identify studies that compared laparoscopic surgery (LS) and open surgery (OS) for neonates with CDO. Meta-analysis was used to pool and compare variables such as operative time, time to feeding, length of hospital stay, anastomotic leak or stricture, postoperative ileus, wound infection, and overall postoperative complications.
RESULTS: Among the 1348 neonatal participants with CDO in the ten studies, 304 received LS and 1044 received OS. When compared to the OS approach, the LS approach resulted in shorter hospital stays, faster time to initial and full feeding, longer operative time, and less wound infection. However, no significant difference in secondary outcomes such as anastomotic leak or stricture, postoperative ileus, and overall postoperative complications was found between LS and OS.
CONCLUSIONS: LS is a safe, feasible and effective surgical procedure for neonatal CDO when compared to OS. Compared with OS, LS has a faster time to feeding, a shorter hospital stay, and less wound infection. Furthermore, in terms of anastomotic leak or stricture, postoperative ileus, and overall postoperative complications, LS is equivalent to OS. We conclude that LS should be considered an acceptable option for CDO.
