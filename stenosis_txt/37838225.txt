Title: Efficacy of epidural infiltration in the management of pain and disability due to acute and subacute lumbosacral radiculopathy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Epidural infiltrations are used for treatment of low back pain and sciatica. Linked to lumbar radiculopathy (lumbosacral radicular syndrome). This study evaluates the efficacy of epidural infiltration by different routes to reduce pain intensity, disability and return to work.
METHODS: Is a prospective observational study in one hundred consecutive patients sent to pain unit for severe lumbo-sacral radiculopaty. We analyze the efficacy on pain relief (Visual Analogue Scale) and funcional status at two weeks, one month, and three months after epidural injection of local anesthetics and esteroids with differents approachs (interlaminar, caudal and transforaminal).
RESULTS: Ninety nine patients (46.5% men, 53.5 women) were finally enrrolled in the study. Mean age was 57.47 ± 11.1 years. The caudal approach was used in 58.6% patients, 23.2% transforaminal approach, and 18.2% interlaminar approach. A significant pain relief was found in all times studied (EAV 7.48 ± 1.5 basal; 6.2 ± 0,9 at 15 days; 6.3 ± 1.2 at one month; 6.15 ± 1.3 at 3 months, p < 0.05). Transforaminal approach was superior to caudal or interlaminal. Seventy percent in time off work patients returned to work after epidural inyections.
CONCLUSIONS: Epidural local anesthetics with esteroids injections for lumbo-sacral radiculopathy were effective for low back pain, improved functional status and promoted return to work. Transforaminal approach is superior to others.
