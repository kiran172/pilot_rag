Title: RNA Sequencing of Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis Tissues Uncovers Putative Profibrotic Mechanisms and Identifies a Prognostic Biomarker.

Abstract: Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a localized airway disease that almost exclusively affects females. Understanding the molecular mechanisms involved may provide insights leading to therapeutic interventions. Next-generation sequencing was performed on tissue sections from patients with iSGS (n = 22), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV; n = 5), and matched controls (n = 9) to explore candidate genes and mechanisms of disease. Gene expression changes were validated, and selected markers were identified by immunofluorescence staining. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and leukocyte extravasation pathways were the biological mechanisms most relevant to iSGS pathogenesis. Alternatively activated macrophages (M2) were abundant in the subepithelium and perisubmucosal glands of the airway in iSGS and AAV. Increased expression of the mesenchymal marker S100A4 and decreased expression of the epithelial marker epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EPCAM) further supported a role for EMT, but to different extents, in iSGS and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated subglottic stenosis. In patients with iSGS, high expression of prostate transmembrane protein, androgen induced 1 (PMEPA1), an EMT regulator, was associated with a shorter recurrence interval (25 versus 116 months: hazard ratio = 4.16; P = 0.041; 95% CI, 1.056-15.60). Thus, EMT is a key pathogenetic mechanism of subglottic stenosis in iSGS and AAV. M2 macrophages contribute to the pathogenesis of both diseases, suggesting a shared profibrotic mechanism, and PMEPA1 may be a biomarker for predicting disease recurrence in iSGS.
