Title: A systematic review and meta-analysis of delayed coronary artery access for coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).

Abstract: Coronary artery disease (CAD) and severe aortic valve stenosis frequently coexist. Given the progressive nature of CAD, silent or non-significant CAD may become symptomatic or functionally relevant years after TAVR. However, there is a paucity of data documenting the feasibility of either coronary angiography and/or PCI after TAVR. We systematically searched Medline, Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane database, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Web of Science, and conference abstracts from conception to March 2020 using OvidSP in TAVR patients undergoing coronary angiography with or without PCI at least 6 months after TAVR. Patients and procedural characteristics were summarized. The primary outcome of interest was successful coronary angiography for either the left main coronary artery (LMCA) or right coronary artery (RCA) with or without PCI. Pooled estimates were calculated using a random-effects meta-analysis. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO. Eleven reports for a total of 696 coronary angiograms and 287 PCI were included in the analysis. Patients were slightly predominantly male, older and had a mean left ventricular ejection fraction of more than 50% with an intermediate STS. The summary estimate rates of successful LMCA and RCA angiography with a Medtronic self-expandable valve (SEV) were 84% (95% CI 73-90%, I2 = 79, p = 0.015) and 69% (95% CI 37-89%, I2 = 86, p = 0.23), respectively, while with the Edwards Lifesciences balloon expandable valve (BEV), the summary estimate rates for successful LMCA and RCA angiography were 94% (95% CI 72-99%, I2 = 66, p = 0.003) and 95% (95% CI 48-99%, I2 = 83, p = 0.05), respectively. The summary estimate rate of successful PCI post TAVR with either a Medtronic SEV or Edwards Lifesciences BEV was 93% (95% CI 86-96%, I2 = 33, p = 0.0001). The overall achievement of a successful coronary angiography with or without PCI in post-TAVR patients is high, with a lower success rate for RCA angiography in patients with the Medtronic SEV Mortality and bleeding did not differ in our analysis.
