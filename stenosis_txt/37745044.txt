Title: Spinal‑pelvic sagittal imbalance and paraspinal muscle degeneration in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis: A monocentric, prospective and observational study.

Abstract: Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) is a condition in which the body is held in a poor posture for a long period of time, resulting in a change in the stress structure of the lumbar spine that causes degenerative changes in the muscles of the spine. The sagittal balance of the spine and pelvis and the degeneration of the paravertebral muscles have been the focus of recent research. To explore the relationship between paraspinal muscle degeneration and changes in spine-pelvic sagittal parameters in patients with DLSS, 95 patients with DLSS (experimental group) and 70 healthy volunteers (control group) hospitalized in the Ordos Central Hospital between January 2020 and January 2022 were included as study subjects. All patients underwent lumbar magnetic resonance imaging and spinal X-ray using uniform criteria. The correlation between paravertebral muscle parameters and sagittal-pelvic sagittal parameters in patients with DLSS was obtained from two imaging examinations, and the data were organized and grouped in order to explore the correlation between these parameters. There was no significant difference in the general data between the two groups (P>0.05). In the L4-5 DLSS patient group, the ratio of fat infiltration in the right erector spinae (ES) muscle was negatively correlated with thoracic kyphosis (TK) (r=-0.536; P<0.05) but not significantly in the left side. The relative cross-sectional area of the left multifidus muscle (MF RCSA) was positively correlated with TK (r=0.685; r=0.615; P<0.05) but not significantly in the right side. In the L5-S1DLSS patient group, the right MF RCSA and right ES RCSA were significantly positively correlated with TK (r=0.685; r=0.615; P<0.05) but not significant in the left side. Thus, paravertebral muscle parameters were correlated with spinal-pelvic sagittal parameters in patients with DLSS.
