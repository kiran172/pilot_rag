Title: Acute ischemic stroke and convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage in large vessel atherosclerotic stenosis: Case series and review of the literature.

Abstract: Atraumatic convexity subarachnoid hemorrhage (cSAH) is a rare non-aneurysmal SAH, commonly due to ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. It is unusual for the cSAH to occur contralaterally to the infarct. We report two cases of acute ischemic stroke associated with contralateral and ipsilateral cSAH that had different presentations.
