Title: Transcarotid Artery Revascularization and Advances in Vascular Surgery for Carotid Artery Disease.

Abstract: Carotid artery atherosclerotic disease impacts over 2 million Americans annually. Since the advent of the carotid endarterectomy by Debakey in 1953, the surgical management of carotid artery stenosis has prevented cerebrovascular accidents. The technology utilized to manage carotid artery stenosis continued to evolve with the utilization of carotid artery stenting in 1989 and more recently transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR). This review discusses the modern management of carotid artery stenosis with an emphasis on transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) and reversal of flow for reversal of flow for embolic protection.
