Title: Feasibility of transcaval access TAVI in morbidly obese patients: A single-center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We report a single-center experience in utilizing the transcaval-access transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) as an alternative approach in morbidly obese patients.
BACKGROUND: Morbidly obese patients present frequently for TAVI. Transfemoral arterial access TAVI in these patients is technically challenging due to deep arterial access, resulting in a higher risk of vascular complications. Transcaval access TAVI is increasingly used in patients with prohibitive iliofemoral arterial access.
METHODS: We used the transcaval approach for eight morbidly obese patients who had otherwise technically feasible femoral arterial access. This technique provides an alternative arterial access point that potentially circumvents some of the challenges relating to femoral arterial access.
RESULTS: We report eight morbidly obese patients with a mean body mass index of 42.3 ± 6.2 kg/m2 who underwent transcaval access TAVI at our center (mean EuroScore II 2.47 ± 1.83%). The patient mean age was 70.3 ± 9.8 years; six were female. All eight patients underwent a successful and uncomplicated procedure. The median time to discharge was 2 days and all patients were alive at 30 days.
CONCLUSIONS: Transcaval access TAVI is a feasible alternative for morbidly obese patients and may reduce vascular complications. Further data are required to evaluate the safety of this approach.
