Title: Aortic stenosis and the pulse contour: A true marker of severity?

Abstract: The aortic pulse contour displays characteristic changes associated with the progression of aortic stenosis (AS). A diminished and delayed aortic pulse contour is indicative of significant AS, but the aortic contour may also be affected by factors including aging, hypertension and increased peripheral arterial elastance. This review describes the components of the aortic pulse contour in AS and how it can be affected by different conditions and interventions.
