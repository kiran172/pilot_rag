Title: Computed tomography imaging for subclinical leaflet thrombosis following surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Subclinical leaflet thrombosis (LT) may occur following surgical and transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Computed tomography (CT) has become an established imaging modality to diagnose subclinical LT following bioprosthetic aortic valve replacement. Even so, there is a limited (but growing) experience in utilizing CT imaging for this indication. This review emphasizes a systematic approach to acquiring and analysing CT imaging for subclinical LT, highlighting evidence surrounding clinical sequelae of subclinical LT and anti-thrombotic implications following diagnosis.
