Title: Complete uterine septum involving cervix with unilateral external cervical os stenosis: diagnosis and management.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital external cervical os stenosis is a form of Mullerian duct abnormality which is rare in virginal adolescents.
CASE: Pre-operatively, two non-sexually active adolescents of 12 and 14 years of age, with history of light menses and severe lower abdominal pain for 2 and 4 months respectively, were diagnosed with an obstructed, oblique vaginal septum syndrome. However, at operative vaginoscopy, a single cervix with a duplicated cervical os and unilateral cervical stenosis was discovered, confirming the diagnosis of a complete uterine septum involving the cervix and unilateral cervical stenosis. They were treated by expanding the affected external cervical os while leaving the hymen intact. A year following the treatment, follow up results found no recurrence of symptoms.
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION: Operative vaginoscopy using a hysteroscope is crucial and recommended for the diagnosis and treatment of congenital external cervical os stenosis in virginal adolescents.
