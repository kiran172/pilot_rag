Title: Carotid Artery Stenting in Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis: JACC Review Topic of the Week.

Abstract: The advance of therapies to reduce the stroke impact of asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis has proved difficult over the last decade. Disagreement concerning the underlying randomized control trials has limited entry into the care arena of endovascular therapies. Recently, advances in percutaneous therapies for carotid artery disease have been reported and provide a substantial database supporting the further incorporation of endovascular-based therapies in patients who need revascularization and meet selection criteria. With a second randomized control trial now published, it is time for a re-evaluation of endovascular therapy as a component of carotid artery care. This review describes the advances in the field in the last 5 years, clarifying the current position of these therapies in the care of the patient with asymptomatic carotid artery disease.
