Title: Myocardial Surgical Revascularization in Patients with Reduced Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Myocardial surgical revascularization in patients with low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is accompanied by a high rate of morbidity and mortality.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate and eliminate the reasons for the most common perioperative and postoperative complications.
METHODS: A total of 64 were analyzed. of patients during 2019 who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), average age 61.29Â±9.12 years.
RESULTS: Out of the total number of operated patients, there were 16 women and 48 men. Patients were divided into two groups. The first group consisted of patients who underwent surgery with the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (cCABG-CPB) and the second group those who underwent surgery without the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (OPCAB). In 41 patients, myocardial infarction was previously recorded. Critical stenosis of the main trunk of the left coronary artery was present in 14 patients. The incidence of postoperative complications was higher in the cCABG-CPB 16/10 group (p0.030).
CONCLUSION: In our study, we confirmed that myocardial revascularization is justified, especially in the case of multivessel coronary disease. In the long term, it significantly improves the systolic function of the left ventricle, and thus and quality and length of life.
