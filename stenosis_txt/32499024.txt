Title: Left Ventricular Hypertrophy and Clinical Outcomes Over 5 Years After TAVR: An Analysis of the PARTNER Trials and Registries.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the association between severity of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and outcomes out to 5 years.
BACKGROUND: Prior studies assessing the association between baseline LVH and outcomes after surgical or TAVR for aortic stenosis (AS) have yielded conflicting results.
METHODS: Patients with severe symptomatic AS at intermediate or high risk in the PARTNER (Placement of Aortic Transcatheter Valve) 1, 2, and S3 trials and registries who received TAVR and had baseline measurements for left ventricular mass index (LVMi) were analyzed. The presence and severity of LVH was determined by LVMi using American Society of Echocardiography sex-specific cutoffs.
RESULTS: Among 4,280 patients, those with no (n = 1,325), mild (n = 777), moderate (n = 628), and severe (n = 1,550) LVH had 5-year rates of death of 32.8%, 37.3%, 37.2%, and 44.8%, respectively (p < 0.001), and 5-year rates of cardiovascular (CV) death or rehospitalization of 33.6%, 39.2%, 42.4%, and 49.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). After adjustment, severe LVH (compared with no LVH) was associated with increased all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.16; 95% confidence interval: 1.00 to 1.34; p = 0.04) and CV death or rehospitalization (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.34; 95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.54; p < 0.001), but no increased hazard was observed for mild or moderate LVH. In spline analyses performed in males and females separately, there was a consistent linear association between increased LVMi and an increased adjusted hazard of CV mortality or rehospitalization. A similar relationship was observed for all-cause death in females, but not males.
CONCLUSIONS: Severe baseline LVH is associated with higher 5-year death and rehospitalization rates after TAVR. These findings may have implications for the optimal timing of valve replacement and the potential role for medical therapy to slow or prevent LVH as AS progresses before valve replacement, but further studies are needed.
