Title: [Airway Complications after Lung Transplantation].

Abstract: Lung transplantation is the only option for patients with end-stage pulmonary diseases. During recent years, satisfactory results in terms of long-term survival and quality of life have been achieved with improvements in perioperative management, surgical technique, and immunosuppression. Airway complications after lung transplantation are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Common airway complications after lung transplantation include anastomotic granulation, airway stenosis, bronchomalacia, fistulas, and anastomotic infection. These airway complications often result in repeated hospitalisations and interventions. If bronchoscopic interventions are not effective, other alternatives like surgical intervention or re-transplantation become necessary. While numerous strategies for airway complications have been proven effective, there are still some issues that to be solved. Further research is necessary to reduce mortality and improve quality of life of these patients.
