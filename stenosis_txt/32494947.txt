Title: After ISCHEMIA: is invasive physiology the only remaining gatekeeper for myocardial revascularization in chronic coronary syndromes?

Abstract: The International Study of Comparative Health Effectiveness With Medical And Invasive Approaches (ISCHEMIA) has the potential to be a game changer in terms of the diagnostic and management approach to patients presenting with chronic coronary syndrome, suggesting that coronary revascularization may become almost like a "bail-out" strategy in the treatment of these patients. However, invasive perfusion assessment as a means of detecting the source of myocardial ischaemia at a lesion level, such as fractional flow reserve (FFR), has been validated in the past and established beyond doubt as a key diagnostic tool. The complementary role of the two approaches will be discussed here.
