Title: Cor triatriatum dexter as an incidental finding due to symptomatic bicuspid aortic valve stenosis.

Abstract: Cor triatriatum is a rare congenital heart defect in which a thin, fibro-muscular membrane divides the left or right atrium into two chambers resulting in a triatrial heart. Subdivision of the left atrium named cor triatriatum sinister (CTS), is the more common form, whereas the right atrial equivalent called cor triatriatum dexter (CTD) is rarer. They account for up to 0.4% and 0.025% of the burden of congenital heart disease respectively. We present the case of CTD found incidentally with transthoracic echocardiography for a patient who underwent aortic valve replacement for symptomatic bicuspid aortic valve stenosis.
