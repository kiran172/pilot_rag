Title: Multiple Systemic Vascular Risk Factors Are Associated With Low-Tension Glaucoma.

Abstract: PRCIS: Multiple systemic vascular-associated conditions including systemic hypertension and hypotension, diabetes mellitus, migraine headache, peripheral vascular disease, Raynaud syndrome, and anemia were associated with low-tension glaucoma.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to identify systemic risk factors associated with low-tension glaucoma.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective case-control study design was employed to identify patients seen at the Mayo Clinic Department of Ophthalmology between 2005 and 2015 with low-tension glaucoma and an age-matched and sex-matched control group, each containing 277 patients.
RESULTS: The low-tension glaucoma group had more myopic refractive errors (-1.6 vs. -1.0 D, P<0.001), lower intraocular pressure (14.2 vs. 15.2 mm Hg, P<0.001), and a higher cup-to-disc ratio (0.7 vs. 0.3, P<0.001). The low-tension glaucoma group was significantly less likely to be obese (body mass index >30, P=0.03). This group had a significantly higher prevalence of systemic hypertension [odds ratio (OR): 1.64, P=0.004], diabetes mellitus (OR: 3.01, P<0.001), peripheral vascular disease (OR: 2.61, P=0.009), migraine headache (OR: 2.12, P=0.02), anemia (OR: 2.18, P=0.003), systemic hypotension (OR: 4.43, P<0.001), Raynaud syndrome (OR: 3.09, P=0.05), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (OR: 1.64, P=0.01) or calcium channel blocker use (OR: 1.98, P=0.004). After adjusting for systemic hypertension, calcium channel blocker use remained significant (OR: 1.70, P=0.03). No significant difference was found between groups with respect to hyperlipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea, coronary artery disease, carotid stenosis, stroke, or statin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta-blocker, or metformin use.
CONCLUSIONS: Multiple vascular-associated conditions were associated with low-tension glaucoma including systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, migraine headache, Raynaud syndrome, anemia, systemic hypotension, and calcium channel blocker use. This study strengthens the evidence for the vascular hypothesis of low-tension glaucoma.
