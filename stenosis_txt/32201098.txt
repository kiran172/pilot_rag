Title: Characteristics and usefulness of unintended premature ventricular contraction during invasive assessment of aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postextrasystolic potentiation (PESP)-associated augmentation in left ventricular-aorta pressure gradient (LVAoG) observed after incidental premature ventricular contraction (PVC) during resting echocardiography is similar to dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE)-associated augmentation in LVAoG in patients with low-flow, low-gradient (LF-LG) aortic stenosis (AS). What is not known is whether a similar relationship exists when unintended PVC causes PESP during cardiac catheterization in patients with AS.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed all catheterizations performed for patients with at least moderate AS who had LVAoG assessment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to determine the predictors of pre- and post-PVC mean LVAoG ≥ 40 mmHg.
RESULTS: Between September 2015 to September 2017, of 140 individuals undergoing cardiac catheterization, 34 met study criteria. Mean pre-PVC gradient was 38.9 ± 22.8 mmHg. All patients exhibited PESP-associated augmentation of LVAoG by an average of 28 ± 12%. In multivariate analysis, the only significant predictor of post-PVC mean LVAoG ≥ 40 mmHg was preserved LV function (OR 6.81; 95% CI 1.41-32.82, p = 0.02). Inability to generate ≥ 40 mmHg of mean LVAoG post-PVC had 100% specificity for nonsevere AS in our observational cohort.
CONCLUSIONS: Unintended but interpretable PVCs occurred in one in four patients with AS undergoing cardiac catheterization with measurable hemodynamics. All of our patients with PVCs, regardless of underlying LVEF, exhibited PESP-associated augmentation of LVAoG. Our exploratory analysis suggests that inability to generate ≥40 mmHg of mean LVAoG post-PVC is highly specific for nonsevere AS.
