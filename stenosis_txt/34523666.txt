Title: Left brachiocephalic vein-right atrial bypass in superior vena cava syndrome.

Abstract: Superior vena cava syndrome (SVCS) is a condition with total or partial stenosis in the superior vena cava (SVC) as a result of intrathoracic malignancies or microtrauma caused by central venous catheterisation. Various invasive and surgical interventions are performed to provide venous drainage in these patients whose head and neck venous blood flow is impaired. In this case report, we report on a bypass performed with a synthetic graft between the left brachiocephalic vein and the right atrium in a patient with SVCS.
