Title: New avenues for the assessment of stable ischemic heart disease.

Abstract: Myocardial ischemia is a complex condition which may result from epicardial and/or microvascular causes involving functional and structural mechanisms. These mechanisms may overlap in a given patient illustrating the difficulties for appropriate management. Assessment of myocardial ischemia can be performed using noninvasive and invasive tools. However, despite living in the era of individualized precision medicine, these tools are not yet used in a broader fashion. Emerging noninvasive techniques such as quantitative perfusion cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and stress perfusion computed tomography (CT) or photon-counting CT techniques may contribute to new standards in the assessment of stable angina patients. Invasive evaluation of myocardial ischemia should not only focus on hemodynamically relevant epicardial disease but also involve coronary vasomotor function testing (coronary spasm, coronary flow reserve, and microvascular resistance) where appropriate. Optimal patient management will depend on accurate and comprehensive diagnostic evaluation of myocardial ischemia and development of new treatment options in the future.
