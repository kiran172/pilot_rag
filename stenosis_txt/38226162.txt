Title: Presenilin-1 in smooth muscle cells facilitates hypermuscularization in elastin aortopathy.

Abstract: Smooth muscle cell (SMC) accumulation is central to the pathogenesis of elastin-defective arterial diseases, including supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS). We previously demonstrated that elastin insufficiency activates Notch signaling in aortic SMCs. Activation of Notch is catalyzed by the enzyme gamma-secretase, but the role of catalytic subunits presenilin (PSEN)-1 or PSEN-2 in elastin aortopathy is not defined. Genetic approaches reveal that endothelial cell-specific Psen1 deletion does not improve elastin aortopathy whereas the deletion of either Psen1 in SMCs or Psen2 globally attenuates Notch pathway and SMC proliferation, mitigating aortic disease. With SMC-specific Psen1 deletion in elastin nulls, these rescue effects are more robust and in fact, survival is increased. SMC deletion of Psen1 also attenuates hypermuscularization in newborns heterozygous for the elastin null gene, which genetically mimics SVAS. Similarly, the pharmacological inhibition of PSEN-1 mitigates SMC accumulation in elastin aortopathy. These findings put forth SMC PSEN-1 as a potential therapeutic target in SVAS.
