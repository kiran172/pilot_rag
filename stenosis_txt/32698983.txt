Title: Patient-reported outcomes in adult females with bladder exstrophy: A study of long-term sexual, reproductive and urinary outcomes using social media.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Limited data exist on patient-reported outcomes in adults with bladder exstrophy (BE). We partnered with the Association for the Bladder Exstrophy Community (A-BE-C) using social media to survey adult females with BE. The aim of the study was to assess long-term patient-reported sexual, reproductive and continence outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between December 3, 2018 and January 18, 2019, A-BE-C promoted an anonymous survey of adult females with BE on social media. The survey included the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire - Short Form (ICIQ-SF) in addition to questions on demographics, reproductive and gynecological outcomes.
RESULTS: A total of 130 women with a median age of 30 years (IQR 26, 41) completed the survey. The majority of women were born in the United States (N = 86, 66.2%). Women reported a median of 10 (IQR 5, 17) surgeries performed for their condition. The mean ICIQ-SF score was 6.2 ± 6.2 (moderate). Only 19.2% (N = 25) reported volitionally voiding and the majority reported intermittent catheterization through a catheterizeable channel or the urethra (Summary Table). The mean FSFI score was (20.1 ± 9.0), indicating risk for sexual dysfunction (FSFI < 26.55). Of the respondents, 28.5% (N = 37) were treated for uterine prolapse, 56.9% (N = 74) required surgery in order to use tampons or have penetrative intercourse, and over half (55.4%) reported some degree of dissatisfaction with the appearance of their external genitalia. Forty-seven women (36.2%) reported pregnancies, and of these 32 (68.1%) reported complications with pregnancy. Outcomes of 100 pregnancies included miscarriage/abortion (41.0%), preterm vaginal (3.0%), preterm cesarean section (19.0%), term vaginal (2.0%), and term cesarean section (35.0%). Seven (15.2%) women identified having children with a medical diagnosis, none of which included BE. Infertility was reported in 17.3% (22/127) women. Women identified sexual function, fertility, and body image as areas that need future research.
CONCLUSION: This is the largest study of patient-reported outcomes in females with BE achieved through partnership with an advocacy group and social media. We found that continence and sexual function were both impaired in adult women with BE. Respondents reported poor obstetric and gynecological outcomes including infertility, uterine prolapse, vaginal stenosis, and need for multiple surgeries. BE surgeons, through multi-institutional collaboration, should continue to reassess surgical techniques at initial repair to better address these functional issues. These results should be a part of counseling parents of newborns with BE.
