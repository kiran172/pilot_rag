Title: One-year outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation with the latest-generation SAPIEN balloon-expandable valve: the S3U registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Initial data about the performance of the new-generation SAPIEN 3 Ultra (S3U) valve are highly promising. However, evidence about the longer-term performance and safety of the S3U is scarce.
AIMS: We aimed to investigate the 1-year clinical and echocardiographic outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using the S3U compared with its predecessor, the SAPIEN 3 valve (S3).
METHODS: The SAPIEN 3 Ultra registry included consecutive patients who underwent transfemoral TAVI at 12 European centres with the S3U or S3 between October 2016 and December 2020. One-to-one propensity score (PS) matching was performed to account for differences in baseline characteristics. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause death and the composite of all-cause death, disabling stroke and hospitalisation for heart failure at 1 year.
RESULTS: The overall study cohort encompassed 1,692 patients treated with either the S3U (n=519) or S3 (n=1,173). The PS-matched population had a total of 992 patients (496 per group). At 1 year, the rate of death from any cause was 4.9% in the S3U group and 6.3% in the S3 group (p=0.743). Similarly, there were no significant differences in the rates of the primary composite outcome (9.5% in the S3 group and 6.6% in the S3U group; p=0.162). The S3U was associated with lower rates of mild paravalvular leak (PVL) compared with the S3 (odds ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.44 to 0.88; p<0.01). No significant differences in transprosthetic gradients were observed between the two groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the S3, the S3U transcatheter heart valve was associated with similar 1-year clinical outcomes but reduced rates of mild PVL.
