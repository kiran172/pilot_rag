Title: Serial invasive imaging follow-up of the first clinical experience with the Magmaris magnesium bioresorbable scaffold.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the performance of the commercially available Magmaris sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffold (BRS) with invasive imaging at different time points.
BACKGROUND: Coronary BRS with a magnesium backbone have been recently studied as an alternative to polymeric scaffolds, providing enhanced vessel support and a faster resorption rate. We aimed to assess the performance of the commercially available Magmaris sirolimus-eluting BRS at different time points.
METHODS: A prospective, single-center, nonrandomized study was performed at the Thoraxcenter, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Six patients with stable de novo coronary artery lesions underwent single-vessel revascularization with the Magmaris sirolimus-eluting BRS. Invasive follow-up including intravascular imaging using optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed at different time points.
RESULTS: At a median of 8 months (range 4-12 months) target lesion failure occurred in one patient. Angiography revealed a late lumen loss of 0.59 ± 0.39 mm, a percentage diameter stenosis of 39.65 ± 15.81%, and a binary restenosis rate of 33.3%. OCT showed a significant reduction in both minimal lumen area (MLA) and scaffold area at the site of the MLA by 43.44 ± 28.62 and 38.20 ± 25.74%, respectively. A fast and heterogeneous scaffold degradation process was found with a significant reduction of patent struts at 4-5 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that the latest iteration of magnesium BRS suffers from premature dismantling, resulting in a higher than expected decrease in MLA.
