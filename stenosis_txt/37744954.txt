Title: Artificial intelligence-based opportunistic detection of coronary artery stenosis on aortic computed tomography angiography in emergency department patients with acute chest pain.

Abstract: AIMS: To evaluate a deep-learning model (DLM) for detecting coronary stenoses in emergency room patients with acute chest pain (ACP) explored with electrocardiogram-gated aortic computed tomography angiography (CTA) to rule out aortic dissection.
METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective study included 217 emergency room patients (41% female, mean age 67.2 years) presenting with ACP and evaluated by aortic CTA at our institution. Computed tomography angiography was assessed by two readers, who rated the coronary arteries as 1 (no stenosis), 2 (<50% stenosis), or 3 (≥50% stenosis). Computed tomography angiography was categorized as high quality (HQ), if all three main coronary arteries were analysable and low quality (LQ) otherwise. Curvilinear coronary images were rated by a DLM using the same system. Per-patient and per-vessel analyses were conducted. One hundred and twenty-one patients had HQ and 96 LQ CTA. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the DLM in patients with high-quality image for detecting ≥50% stenoses were 100, 62, 59, 100, and 75% at the patient level and 98, 79, 57, 99, and 84% at the vessel level, respectively. Sensitivity was lower (79%) for detecting ≥50% stenoses at the vessel level in patients with low-quality image. Diagnostic accuracy was 84% in both groups. All 12 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and stenoses by invasive coronary angiography (ICA) were rated 3 by the DLM.
CONCLUSION: A DLM demonstrated high NPV for significant coronary artery stenosis in patients with ACP. All patients with ACS and stenoses by ICA were identified by the DLM.
