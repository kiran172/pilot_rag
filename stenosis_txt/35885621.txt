Title: Practical Echocardiographic Approach of the Regurgitant Mitral Valve Assessment.

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is the second-most frequent valvular heart disease in Europe after degenerative aortic stenosis. It is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and its prevalence is expected to increase with population aging. Echocardiography is the first diagnostic approach to assess its severity, constituting a challenging process in which a multimodality evaluation, integrating quantitative, semiquantitative and qualitative methods, as well as a detailed evaluation of the morphology and function of both left ventricle and atria is the key. In this review, we would like to provide a practical diagnosis approach on the mitral valve regurgitation mechanism, severity quantification, and planning of future therapeutic options.
