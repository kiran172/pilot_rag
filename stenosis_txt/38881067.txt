Title: [Chemotherapy Strategy in a Case of MSI-High Patients with Gastric Cancer-Case Report].

Abstract: A 73-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a chief complaint of black stools and abdominal distention. She was diagnosed with advanced gastric cancer with pyloric stenosis and multiple lymph node metastasis(cT4aN3M0, cStage â…¢)and was administered preoperative chemotherapy after laparoscopy and gastric jejunal bypass surgery. The surgical diagnosis was sT4aN3M0P0CY0. After surgery, 2 courses of DS therapy were administered. However, a new liver metastatic lesion was found, and XELOX therapy was selected as the second-line of treatment. Subsequently, enlarged hepatic hilar lymph nodes were found; microsatellite instability testing confirmed MSI-High cancer. Nivolumab was selected as the third- line therapy. After 15 courses, a new liver metastatic lesion appeared. Although Ram+nab-PTX therapy was chosen as the fourth-line therapy, the patient developed myelosuppression after 3 courses. Two years and 4 months after the initial treatment, the patient was considered to have achieved CR. Because drug-induced liver injury had occurred, the Ram therapy was discontinued. The patient has remained in CR for 1 year without receiving any anticancer drugs. This case suggests that for MSI-high patients with gastric cancer, the consideration of treatment strategy should be based on the molecular biological background.
