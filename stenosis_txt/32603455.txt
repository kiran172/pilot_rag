Title: Anomalous Origin of All Coronary Arteries from Right Sinus of Valsalva.

Abstract: Anomalous coronary arteries are rare and often incidental findings. Most variants are benign. We present the case of a 75-year-old man with exertional dyspnea in whom the left anterior descending coronary artery arose from the right sinus of Valsalva, and the left circumflex coronary artery originated from the distal right coronary artery and supplied the obtuse marginal branch. No arteries originated from the left sinus of Valsalva. The patient was prescribed optimal medical therapy for atherosclerotic stenosis in his ramus intermedius. His symptoms were stable 3 years later.
