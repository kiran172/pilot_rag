Title: Resection of tracheal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma by bronchoscopic high-frequency electrosurgical snare: Case report.

Abstract: There is no standard method of bronchoscopic local therapy for tracheal tumours. We herein present a case involving a 61-year-old woman who was diagnosed with tracheal mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma and underwent resection by a bronchoscopic high-frequency electrosurgical snare. Few reports to date have described such use of high-frequency electrosurgical snares; however, they are effective for the treatment of tracheal tumours, especially pedunculated tumours.
