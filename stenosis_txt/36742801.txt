Title: Fibrous Dysplasia of Temporal Bone.

Abstract: Fibrous dysplasia of temporal bone is a rare benign bone disease. With the advance in imaging, more cases are likely to get reported and present with less disease severity. Temporal Bone Fibrous dysplasia most commonly affects External Auditory canal resulting in External auditory canal stenosis and Conductive Hearing Loss. Many patients are asymptomatic and rarely require intervention. However, we present 3 different clinical scenarios of Temporal Bone Fibrous Dysplasia and elaborate on clinical course that lead to varied managements for each of them.
