Title: A midterm follow-up study of the application of a confluent aortic valve neocuspidization technique with pericardium in children.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment of aortic valve diseases in children remains a great challenge. We aim to report outcomes and midterm follow-up data of our confluent neocuspidization technique with pericardium for aortic valve replacement (AVR) in children.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on all 20 children who underwent the confluent neocuspidization technique with pericardium at Children's Hospital of Fudan University from March 2017 to May 2022. Outcome measures included echocardiographic measurements, surgical intervention, and mortality.
RESULTS: A total of 20 patients (17 males vs. 3 females), with a median age of 7.5 years [min-max, 0.3-12 years; interquartile range (IQR), 4.4-9.7 years], a median body weight of 24.0 kg (min-max, 6.0-52.3 kg; IQR, 15.6-31.0 kg), and median aortic valve annulus size before surgery of 19.0 mm (min-max, 11.0-25.0 mm; IQR, 17.1-21.5 mm), underwent the neocuspidization technique with pericardium (17 autologous pericardia and 3 bovine patch). With 50% of bicuspid aortic valve and 50% of tricuspid, they were respectively diagnosed as aortic stenosis (AS) (7/20, 35%), aortic regurgitation (AR) (8/20, 40%) and mixed AS and AR (AS &amp; AR) (5/20, 25%). The median postoperative follow-up time was 19 months (min-max, 5-61 months; IQR, 16.3-35 months). The peak pressure gradient across the aortic valve decreased from 81.0±37.0 mmHg in AS group and AS &amp; AR group before surgery to 25.9±15.8 mmHg within 24 hours after surgery (P&lt;0.001) and was mostly around 25 mmHg during follow-up. All patients presented mild or less than mild regurgitation within 24 hours after surgery. There were no hospital mortalities. Three patients needed reintervention during follow-up. There was one late death related to mitral valve stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Though the confluent neocuspidization technique with pericardium provided immediate relief of significant AS or regurgitation, the midterm outcome was suboptimal. More research is needed to find the optimal material for AVR.
