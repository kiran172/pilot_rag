Title: [Emergency Operation for Impending Rupture of Syphilitic Aortic Aneurysm with Left Coronary Ostial Stenosis:Report of a Case].

Abstract: Syphilis is known as a cause of syphilitic aortitis. Chronic inflammation leads to formation of syphilitic aneurysm which often is found at the ascending aorta. If the inflammation spreads to the aortic root, stenosis of coronary ostium or aortic valve regurgitation are caused. We report a case that impending rupture of syphilitic aneurysm at ascending aorta with stenosis of left coronary ostium. The patient is a 49 years old male, and his chief complaint was chest pain which gradually became stronger. Computed tomography (CT) identified a large ascending aneurysm with a maximum diameter of 66 mm. The serum rapid plasma regain( RPR) test and the fixed Treponema pallidum latex agglutination( TPLA) test were positive. We diagnosed impending rupture of aneurysm, and performed emergency ascending aorta replacement. The aortic aneurysm was strongly adherent to the surrounding tissues. Pathological findings showed mesaortitis, which was consistent with syphilitic aneurysm. We started oral administration of amoxicillin hydrate from postoperative day 8. The patient did well, and was discharged on postoperative day 18. During his hospitalization, we performed enhanced coronary CT, and found stenosis of left coronary ostium. But he had no symptoms, so he got percutaneous coronary intervention after his discharge. Now the number of patients of syphilis is increasing in Japan. So it is important to know its characteristics and proper treatment.
