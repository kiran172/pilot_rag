Title: Evaluation of the Fractional Flow Reserve by Computer Tomography Data: Comparison of the Calculated Parameters with the Results of Invasive Measurements.

Abstract: Aim      To create a three-dimensional mathematical model of coronary flow in patients with ischemic heart disease based on findings of computed tomography angiography (CTA) with subsequent calculation of the fractional flow reserve (FFRCTA) and comparison of estimated FFRCTA with FFR reference values measured by coronary angiography (CAG).Material and methods  The study included 10 patients with borderline stenosis (50-75 %) as determined by CTA performed with a 640‑slice CT-scanner. Based on CTA findings, three-dimensional mathematical models were constructed for further calculation of FFRCTA. Later, an invasive measurement of FFR (FFRINV) was performed for all patients. FFR values &lt;0.8 indicated the hemodynamic significance of stenosis.Results FFRCTA and FFRINV values differed insignificantly in most cases (n=9) and exceeded 5% in only one case. The regression analysis showed a close correlation between estimated and invasively measured FFR values.Conclusion      Preliminary results showed a good consistency of calculated and measured FFR values. Therefore, further development of the method for mathematical modeling of three-dimensional blood flow by CTA findings is promising. Noninvasive evaluation of FFR is particularly relevant for analysis of hemodynamic significance of borderline (50-75 %) coronary stenoses.
