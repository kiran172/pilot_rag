Title: Exercise echocardiography in aortic stenosis with preserved ejection fraction.

Abstract: The appropriate timing of intervention and follow-up in asymptomatic patients with aortic stenosis remains controversial. Risk stratification is a key, especially with the use of a multimodality imaging approach, including exercise stress echocardiography. This review focuses on the use of exercise echocardiography in asymptomatic patients with moderate and severe aortic stenosis with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. It describes the exercise echocardiography protocol, parameters to be evaluated, and its role in guiding the timing of intervention and follow-up in these patients.
