Title: Endovenous Iliocaval Revascularization for Transplant Kidney Salvage.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We report the case of a venous iliocaval recanalization to preserve a transplant kidney.
CASE REPORT: A young patient with a nephrotic syndrome caused by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) underwent a robot-assisted living-donor kidney transplant. The postoperative course was uneventful; serum creatinine at discharge was 1.51 mg/dL (normal range = 0.72-1.17 mg/dL). In the course of the following months, the patient was readmitted repeatedly due to acute kidney failure not related to rejection, recurrent FSGS, or anastomotic stenosis. All episodes started after prolonged standing and renal function improved after bed rest. Several hospital admissions and investigations later, phlebography revealed an occlusion of the inferior vena cava (IVC) and both common iliac veins with large collateral vessels through the azygos system. An endovenous recanalization of the iliocaval tract was performed, with subsequent normalization of transplant kidney function.
CONCLUSION: Vascular complications after renal transplantation are an important cause of graft loss. We present an endovenous treatment option for a chronic occlusion of the IVC and common iliac vein with intermittent venous congestion as a cause of transplant failure.
