Title: The surgical outcomes of reconstruction for the treatment of ureteral stricture after holmium laser lithotripsy: The comprehensive experiences.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the characteristics of ureteral stricture after ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy and summarize our experience with the reconstructive strategies.
METHODS: This study retrospectively reviewed 42 patients with ureteral stricture after ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy between December 2009 and December 2019. Patient demographics, laboratory data, imaging studies, perioperative variables, complications, and follow-up data were recorded. Surgical success was defined as relief of symptoms, improved/stabilized hydronephrosis, and stable renal function.
RESULTS: The upper, middle, and lower thirds of the ureter were affected in 27, 6, and 7 cases, respectively. Multiple ureteral strictures were found in 2 patients. The median length of the stricture was 3.5 cm (range 1-30 cm). In the upper ureteral strictures, lingual mucosal ureteroplasty (8/27, 29.6%) is the most commonly used treatment method for stricture longer than 3 cm but shorter than 6 cm, followed by appendiceal onlay ureteroplasty (5/27, 18.5%). Four lower ureteral strictures ranging from 3 to 8 cm were repaired with Boari flap. Reconstructive strategies of the middle ureteral strictures included Boari flap, appendiceal onlay ureteroplasty and ureteroureterostomy. Patients with the length of the stricture longer than 8 cm or multiple strictures underwent ileal ureter replacement. The median follow-up was 27.3 ± 17.2 months. The overall success rate was 97.6%.
CONCLUSION: Upper ureter is more vulnerable in ureteroscopic holmium laser lithotripsy. Sufficient follow-up and appropriate examination are necessary for diagnosis. Different treatment strategies need to be flexibly selected according to the location and length of the injury.
