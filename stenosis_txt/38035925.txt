Title: Ischemic stroke secondary to radiation-induced carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Large vessel vasculopathy, such as carotid stenosis, has been shown to be a side effect of radiotherapy (RT) and has received increasing attention especially in recent decades with the improvement of RT technology. These injuries can lead to a higher risk of cerebrovascular events such as ischemic stroke. The management of these lesions may be performed with surgical repair but also with endovascular technique.
OBSERVATION: A 61-year-old man was admitted to the emergency department for an acute ischemic stroke. He was treated 16years prior for laryngeal tumor for which he had received 23 sessions of radiation therapy at the dose of 60Gy per session. The CT scan showed a radiation-induced stenosis of the right internal carotid artery with thrombosis of the right anterior cerebral artery and the right middle cerebral artery. The patient was treated with angioplasty of the right internal carotid artery with good outcome.
CONCLUSION: Radiation-induced vasculopathy of the carotid artery has gained relevance in patients with head and neck neoplasms. These vascular lesions are associated with the risk of late cerebrovascular events.
