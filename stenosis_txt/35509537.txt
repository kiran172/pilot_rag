Title: Bow hunter's syndrome treated by anterior decompression with fusion: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bow hunter's syndrome (BHS) is a rare condition induced by occlusion or compression of the vertebral artery (VA) during head movement or rotation. Here, we report a patient with BHS effectively treated with an anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF).
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 75-year-old male experienced recurrent embolic strokes to the posterior circulation. This was attributed angiographically to transient stenosis of the right VA due to a right-sided C5-C6 osteophyte when the head was rotated to the right; the stenosis was improved when the patient rotated his head to the left. The patient successfully underwent a C5-C6 ACDF for removal of the right-sided lateral osteophyte which resulted in no further transient right-sided VA occlusion.
CONCLUSION: Following a C5-C6 ACDF for removal of a right lateral osteophyte, a 75-year-old male's intermittent right-sided VA occlusion responsible for multiple posterior circulation emboli was relieved.
