Title: Utility of FFRCT in Patients with Chest Pain.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The goal of this article is to review the data supporting the use of fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography angiography (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) in patients with chest pain.
REVIEW FINDINGS: Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy of coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) can be improved with the use of FFR<sub>CT</sub>, primarily due to its superior specificity when compared to CCTA alone. This promising development may help reduce the need for invasive angiography in patients presenting with chest pain. Furthermore, some studies have indicated that incorporating FFR<sub>CT</sub> into decision-making is safe, with an FFR<sub>CT</sub> value of ≥ 0.8 being associated with favorable outcomes. While FFR<sub>CT</sub> has been shown to be feasible in patients with acute chest pain, further large-scale studies are warranted to confirm its utility. The emergence of FFR<sub>CT</sub> as a tool for the management of patients with chest pain is promising. However, potential limitations require the interpretation of FFR<sub>CT</sub> in conjunction with clinical context.
