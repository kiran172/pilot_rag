Title: Cardiovascular disease among bariatric surgery candidates: coronary artery screening and the impact of metabolic syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Obesity is known as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, there is an absence of preoperative cardiac risk assessment in bariatric surgery candidates and the incidence of CVD among these high-risk patients is still unknown.
METHODS: A consecutive series of bariatric surgery candidates at two Chinese tertiary hospitals received coronary CT angiography or coronary angiography from 2017 to 2023. Patients were categorized as metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO) and metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) based on the presence or absence of MetS. CVD was diagnosed based on the maximum intraluminal stenosis > 1% in any of the segments of the major epicardial coronary arteries. Obstructive CVD was defined as coronary stenosis ≥ 50%. Binary multivariable logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between CVD and metabolic status. The number of principal MetS components was categorized into zero (without glycemic, lipid, and BP components), one (with one of the components), two (with any two components), and three (with all components) to explore their association with CVD.
RESULTS: A total of 1446 patients were included in the study. The incidence of CVD and obstructive CVD were 31.7% and 9.6%. Compared with MHO patients, MUO patients had a significantly higher incidence of mild (13.7% vs. 6.1%, P < 0.05), moderate (7.4% vs. 0.8%, P < 0.05), and severe CVD (3.1% vs. 0%, P < 0.05). Following complete adjustment, compared with zero or one component, two principal MetS components was found to be associated with a notable increase in the risk of CVD (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.18-3.58, P < 0.05); three principal MetS components were observed to have a higher risk of CVD and obstructive CVD (OR 2.68, 95% CI 1.56-4.62, P < 0.001; OR 3.93, 95% CI 1.19-12.93, P < 0.05). Each increase in the number of principal MetS components correlated with a 1.47-fold (95% CI 1.20-1.81, P < 0.001) and 1.78-fold (95% CI 1.24-2.55, P < 0.05) higher risk of CVD and obstructive CVD, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study reported the incidence of CVD based on multicenter bariatric surgery cohorts. CVD is highly prevalent in patients with obesity, especially in MUO patients. Increased number of principal MetS components will significantly elevate the risk of CVD.
