Title: Endobronchial tuberculosis in children: Defining the role of interventional bronchoscopy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endobronchial tuberculosis (EBTB) can lead to bronchopulmonary complications when diagnosis is delayed. Bronchoscopic treatment in children can be challenging due to small airway size. We report our experience treating children with EBTB.
METHODS: Retrospective study (2014-2020) of patients diagnosed with EBTB. Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) was performed in patients with previous diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), after respiratory/radiological worsening was observed in spite of medical treatment. Treatment consisted in oral corticotherapy in all patients, and interventional bronchoscopy in selected cases. Our aim is to describe the endoscopic findings, interventional bronchoscopy alternatives, and outcome.
RESULTS: Of 45 patients with PTB, 13 (28.9%, 7 M/6 F) were diagnosed with EBTB, with a mean age of 3.9 years (0.4-12.8). Four bronchoscopic patterns were observed. Endobronchial granuloma (N:9; 69.2%): Excision with rigid bronchoscopy was achieved in five (1-5 procedures per patient), while corticotherapy alone was preferred in the remaining four due to small size/distal location of the granuloma. Caseum obstruction (2; 15.4%): dense mucous molds were removed with flexible/rigid bronchoscopy (6 and 8 procedures, respectively). Bronchial stenosis (1; 7.7%): two balloon dilatations with mitomycin-C application were performed. Extrinsic compression (1; 7.7%): oral corticotherapy alone was initiated. One patient developed bronchoscopy-related complications (pneumothorax requiring thoracic tube 48 h). With a medium follow-up of 4.6 years (1.8-7.6), three patients developed bronchiectasis while the remaining 10 improved clinically and radiologically.
CONCLUSION: Bronchoscopic findings in EBTB include granuloma, stenosis, caseum obstruction and external compression. In selected cases, interventional bronchoscopy can minimize long-term bronchopulmonary complications.
