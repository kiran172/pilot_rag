Title: Peptic ulcer.

Abstract: Peptic ulcer disease is a frequent pathology; although the incidence has decreased in recent years, it continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality associated with high healthcare costs. The most important risk factors are Helicobacter pylori(H. pylori) infection and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Most patients with peptic ulcer disease remain asymptomatic, with dyspepsia being the most frequent and often characteristic symptom. It can also debut with complications such as upper gastrointestinal bleeding, perforation or stenosis. The diagnostic technique of choice is upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. Treatment with proton pump inhibitors, eradication of H. pylori and avoiding the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the basis of treatment. However, prevention is the best strategy, it includes an adequate indication of proton pump inhibitors, investigation and treatment of H. pylori, avoiding non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or using those that are less gastrolesive.
