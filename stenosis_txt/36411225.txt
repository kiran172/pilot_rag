Title: Correlation between serum Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) levels and coronary artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To study the correlation between the level of serum Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) and the degree of coronary artery stenosis in patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In 2018, general data and biochemical indexes of 311 patients who underwent coronary angiography were recorded. Before procedure, arterial blood was drawn and the concentrations of DKK1, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) were measured. Based on coronary angiography results, subjects were divided into a coronary heart disease (CHD) group; and a non-coronary heart disease (non-CHD)group. The CHD group was divided into three subgroups: the low Gensini score; the middle Gensini score; and the high Gensini score subgroups. Compared with those of the non-CHD group, DKK1, RBP4 and PAI-1 of the CHD group were significantly higher, while the OC was lower. DKK1,RBP4 and PAI-1 levels of the middle and high Gensini subgroups were significantly higher, compared with that of the low Gensini subgroup. Differences between osteocalcin (OC), beta-isomerized C-terminal telopeptidase (β-CTX), and 25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> of the three subgroups were not significant. Correlation between DKK1 and the inflammatory factors, RBP4 and PAI-1, was positive. Correlation between DKK1 and β - CTX, 25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> and OC was not significant. DKK1 was a risk factor for CHD. The degree of coronary artery stenosis was related to DKK1 concentration.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum DKK1 levels in coronary heart disease patients were significantly higher, and positively correlated with the degree of coronary artery stenosis. DKK1 level is an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease.
