Title: The Current Status of Endovascular Treatment for Extracranial Steno-occlusive Diseases in Japan: Analysis Using the Japanese Registry of Neuroendovascular Therapy 3 (JR-NET3).

Abstract: Endovascular treatment of extracranial steno-occlusive lesions is an alternative to direct surgery. There is no consensus regarding the natural course and standard treatment of these lesions. The aim of this study was to identify the current status of endovascular treatment for extracranial steno-occlusive lesions. A total of 1154 procedures for extracranial steno-occlusive lesions, except for internal carotid artery stenosis, were collected from the Japanese Registry of Neuroendovascular Therapy 3 (JR-NET3). Atherosclerotic lesions were most frequent (1021 patients, 88.5%). Endovascular treatment was performed for 456 (39.5%) patients with subclavian artery, 349 (30.2%) with extracranial vertebral artery, 172 (14.9%) with the origin of common carotid artery, and 38 (3.3%) with innominate artery stenosis; the overall technical success rate was 98.0%. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was performed in 307 patients (26.6%) and stenting in 838 (72.6%). An embolic protection device (EPD) was used in 571 patients (49.5%), and procedure under general anesthesia was performed in 168 (14.6%). Preoperative antiplatelet therapy was administered in 1091 procedures (94.5%). A good outcome was obtained for 962 patients (83.4%). Complications were observed in 89 patients (7.7%). The procedure under general anesthesia was statistically significant factors (P <0.01), and also after multivariable adjustment (odds ratio 2.29; 95% confidence interval 1.25-4.17; P <0.01). Comparisons between JR-NET3 and previous cohorts (JR-NET1&2), the utilization of EPD and complications increased significantly, and the type of antiplatelet therapy changed markedly. Based on the results of this study, endovascular treatment for extracranial steno-occlusive lesions is relatively safe. Further prospective studies are necessary to validate the beneficial effects.
