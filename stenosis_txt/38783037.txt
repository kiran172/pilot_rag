Title: Evaluation of stenoses using AI video models applied to coronary angiography.

Abstract: The coronary angiogram is the gold standard for evaluating the severity of coronary artery disease stenoses. Presently, the assessment is conducted visually by cardiologists, a method that lacks standardization. This study introduces DeepCoro, a ground-breaking AI-driven pipeline that integrates advanced vessel tracking and a video-based Swin3D model that was trained and validated on a dataset comprised of 182,418 coronary angiography videos spanning 5 years. DeepCoro achieved a notable precision of 71.89% in identifying coronary artery segments and demonstrated a mean absolute error of 20.15% (95% CI: 19.88-20.40) and a classification AUROC of 0.8294 (95% CI: 0.8215-0.8373) in stenosis percentage prediction compared to traditional cardiologist assessments. When compared to two expert interventional cardiologists, DeepCoro achieved lower variability than the clinical reports (19.09%; 95% CI: 18.55-19.58 vs 21.00%; 95% CI: 20.20-21.76, respectively). In addition, DeepCoro can be fine-tuned to a different modality type. When fine-tuned on quantitative coronary angiography assessments, DeepCoro attained an even lower mean absolute error of 7.75% (95% CI: 7.37-8.07), underscoring the reduced variability inherent to this method. This study establishes DeepCoro as an innovative video-based, adaptable tool in coronary artery disease analysis, significantly enhancing the precision and reliability of stenosis assessment.
