Title: Spontaneous internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm complicated with ischemic stroke in a young man: A case report and review of literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery pseudoaneurysm (PSA) is infrequently encountered in clinical settings. Internal carotid artery (ICA) PSA complicated with ischemic stroke is rare. PSAs are typically caused by iatrogenic injury, trauma, or infection. The underlying mechanisms of spontaneous PSA formation are not well characterized. We report a healthy young man who presented with stroke as a complication of spontaneous PSA of the left ICA.
CASE SUMMARY: A 30-year-old man working as a ceiling decoration worker was hospitalized due to sudden-onset speech disorder and right lower extremity weakness. Medical history was unremarkable. Brain computed tomography revealed ischemic stroke. Digital subtraction angiography showed a left ICA PSA with mild stenosis. The patient was conservatively managed with oral anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. He recovered well and was discharged. The patient was in good condition during follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The occupational history of patient should be taken into consideration while evaluating the etiology of spontaneous ICA PSA in young people with stroke.
