Title: Murray law-based quantitative flow ratio to assess left main bifurcation stenosis: selecting the angiographic projection matters.

Abstract: Murray law-based quantitative flow ratio (µQFR) assesses fractional flow reserve (FFR) in bifurcation lesions using a single angiographic view, enhancing the feasibility of analysis; however, accuracy may be compromised in suboptimal angiographic projections. FFR<sub>CT</sub> is a well-validated non-invasive method measuring FFR from coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA). We evaluated the feasibility of µQFR in left main (LM) bifurcations, the impact of the optimal/suboptimal fluoroscopic view with respect to CCTA, and its diagnostic concordance with FFR<sub>CT</sub>. In 300 patients with three-vessel disease, the values of FFR<sub>CT</sub> and µQFR were compared at distal LM, proximal left anterior descending artery (pLAD) and circumflex artery (pLCX). The optimal viewing angle of LM bifurcation was defined on CCTA by 3-dimensional coordinates and converted into a 2-dimensional fluoroscopic view. The best fluoroscopic projection was considered the closest angulation to the optimal viewing angle on CCTA. µQFR was successfully computed in 805 projections. In the best projections, µQFR sensitivity was 88.2% (95% CI 76.1-95.6) and 84.8% (71.1-93.7), and specificity was 96.8% (93.8-98.6) and 97.2% (94.4-98.9), in pLAD and pLCX, respectively, with regard to FFR<sub>CT</sub>. The AUC of µQFR for predicting FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 tended to be improved using the best versus suboptimal projections (0.94 vs. 0.89 [p = 0.048] in pLAD; 0.94 vs. 0.88 [p = 0.075] in pLCX). Computation of µQFR in LM bifurcations using a single angiographic view showed high feasibility from post-hoc analysis of coronary angiograms obtained for clinical purposes. The fluoroscopic viewing angle influences the diagnostic performance of physiological assessment using a single angiographic view.
