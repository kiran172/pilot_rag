Title: Microvascular Myocardial Ischemia in Patients With Diabetes Without Obstructive Coronary Stenosis and Its Association With Angina.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of microvascular myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients without obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) and its relationship with angina.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Diabetic patients and an intermediate-to-high pretest probability of CAD were prospectively enrolled. Non-diabetic patients but with an intermediate-to-high pretest probability of CAD were retrospectively included as controls. The patients underwent dynamic computed tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) to quantify coronary stenosis, myocardial blood flow (MBF), and extracellular volume (ECV). The proportion of patients with microvascular myocardial ischemia, defined as any myocardial segment with a mean MBF ≤ of 100 mL/min/100 mL, in patients without obstructive CAD (Coronary Artery Disease-Reporting and Data System [CAD-RADS] grade 0-2 on CCTA) was determined. Various quantitative parameters of the patients with and without diabetes without obstructive CAD were compared. Multivariable analysis was used to determine the association between microvascular myocardial ischemia and angina symptoms in diabetic patients without obstructive CAD.
RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-two diabetic patients (mean age: 59.7 ± 10.7; 77 males) and 266 non-diabetic patients (62.0 ± 12.3; 167 males) were enrolled; CCTA revealed 113 and 155 patients without obstructive CAD, respectively. For patients without obstructive CAD, the mean global MBF was significantly lower for those with diabetes than for those without (152.8 mL/min/100 mL vs. 170.4 mL/min/100 mL, P &lt; 0.001). The mean ECV was significantly higher for diabetic patients (27.2% vs. 25.8%, P = 0.009). Among the patients without obstructive CAD, the incidence of microvascular myocardial ischemia (36.3% [41/113] vs. 10.3% [16/155], P &lt; 0.001) and interstitial fibrosis (69.9% [79/113] vs. 33.3% [8/24], P = 0.001) were significantly higher in diabetic patients than in the controls. The presence of microvascular myocardial ischemia was independently associated with angina symptoms (adjusted odds ratio = 3.439, P = 0.037) in diabetic patients but without obstructive CAD.
CONCLUSION: Dynamic CT-MPI + CCTA revealed a high incidence of microvascular myocardial ischemia in diabetic patients without obstructive CAD. Microvascular myocardial ischemia is strongly associated with angina.
