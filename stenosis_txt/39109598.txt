Title: Serial Vascular Responses of Balloon-Expandable Stent With Biodegradable Film-Type Graft in a Rabbit Iliac Artery Dissection Model (BioGard Study).

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Arterial dissection during endovascular therapy rarely occurs but can be lethal. A fabric-based covered graft stents yield poor clinical outcomes. A novel balloon-expandable stent with biodegradable film graft for overcoming these issues was evaluated in a rabbit iliac artery model.
METHOD: Eighteen rabbits with iliac artery dissections were induced by balloon over-inflation on angiography (Ellis type 2 or 3) and treated using the test device (3.0Ã—24 mm). Subsequently, survived twelve animals underwent histologic examinations and micro-computed tomography (CT) at 0, 2, 4, and 8 weeks and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and angiography at one-year.
RESULTS: There were no adverse cardiovascular events during the one-year. Early-stage histologic examination revealed complete sealing of disrupted vessels by the device, exhibiting mural hematoma, peri-stent red thrombi, and dense infiltration of inflammatory cells. Mid- and long-term histologic examination showed patent stents with neointimal hyperplasia over the stents (% area stenosis: 11.8 at 2 weeks, 26.1 at 1 month, 29.7 at 3 months, 49.2 at 9 months, and 51.0 at 1 year), along with mild peri-strut inflammatory response (Grade: 1-2 at mid-term and 0-1 at long-term). The graft film became scarcely visible after six months. Both CT and angiography revealed no instances of thrombotic occlusion or in-stent restenosis (% diameter stenosis: 5.7 at 2 weeks, 12.3 at 1 month, 14.2 at 3 months, 25.1 at 9 months, and 26.6 at 1 year).
CONCLUSIONS: The novel balloon-expandable stent with a biodegradable film graft demonstrates feasibility in managing severe artery dissection and preventing lethal vascular events in animal model.
