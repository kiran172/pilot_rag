Title: An effective approach for the treatment of severe punctal stenosis: Bicanalicular silicone tube intubation with pigtail probe.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the results of using a pigtail probe to open the inferior punctum followed by bicanalicular silicone tube intubation in patients with severe acquired punctal stenosis.
METHODS: Forty-one eyes of 25 patients with severe inferior punctal stenosis admitted to our tertiary care center were included in the study. The degree of epiphora was determined using the Munk score and the fluorescein disappearance test. The inferior punctum was located and opened by entering the superior punctum with a pigtail probe. Then, bicanalicular silicone tube intubation was performed. The silicone tube was removed after six months. A Munk score of 0 or 1 and a fluorescein disappearance test score of 1 and 2 were considered a complete success.
RESULTS: Ten (40%) patients were male, and 15 (60%) were female. The mean age was 60.4Â±15.5years. One year after the surgery, epiphora was absent in 18 eyes (43.9%) (Munk score grade 0) and rarely seen in 9 eyes (22%) (Munk score grade 1). At the one-year follow-up, the fluorescein disappearance test score was stage 1 (<3min) in 21 eyes (51.2%) and stage 2 (3-5min) in 13 eyes (31.7%). There was a statistically significant difference between the preoperative and one-year postoperative test results (P<0.001).
CONCLUSION: In cases with severe punctal stenosis, a pigtail probe is an effective method for locating and opening the punctum, and punctal opening and prevention of restenosis were achieved by a bicanalicular stent.
