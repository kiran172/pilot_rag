Title: Do Postoperative Oral Corticosteroids Improve Results After Sialendoscopy for Ductal Stenosis?

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aims to review the effects of short- and long-term oral administration of postoperative corticosteroids in patients undergoing sialendoscopy for the treatment of obstructive sialadenitis due to ductal stenosis.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective comparative study.
METHODS: A prospective observational study was conducted at Manukau Surgical Center in Auckland, New Zealand, where patients undergoing sialendoscopic surgery for recurrent obstructive sialadenitis due to ductal stenoses were reviewed. Univariable and multivariable analysis, and also logistic regression were performed to identify variables correlated with the likelihood of the need for revision surgery for persistent or recurrent symptoms.
RESULTS: In this study, sialendoscopy was performed in 142 patients: 162 parotid glands (86.6%) and 25 submandibular glands (13.4%). Postoperative oral steroids were prescribed for 48 patients (34%); 19 (13%) were prescribed for less than 7 days and 29 (20%) for more than 7 days. In total, 33 patients (23.2%) required a revision sialendoscopy during follow-up due to recurrence of symptoms. Oral steroids prescribed for more than 7 days after a sialendoscopy reduced the likelihood of a revision procedure by 93% when compared with patients who did not receive this medication, and by 96% when compared with patients who received steroids for less than 7 days.
CONCLUSION: The results showed that in our population oral administration of corticosteroids for more than 7 days after sialendoscopy for the treatment of recurrent obstructive sialadenitis due to ductal stenosis markedly reduced the need for later revision surgery. Routine use of corticosteroids for more than 7 days is recommended after sialendoscopy in patients with ductal stenosis.
