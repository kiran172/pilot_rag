Title: Association between lipid profile changes and risk of in-stent restenosis in ischemic stroke patients with intracranial stenosis: A retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The risk of ischemic stroke with intracranial stenosis is associated with various serum lipid levels. However, the effects of changes in the lipid profile on the risk of in-stent restenosis have not been verified. Therefore, we investigated the association between the occurrence of in-stent restenosis at 12-month follow-up and changes in various lipid profiles.
METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we included ischemic stroke patients who had undergone intracranial stenting for symptomatic intracranial stenosis between February 2010 and May 2020. We collected data about serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels, and calculated the TC/HDL-C and LDL-C/HDL-C ratios at baseline and after 12 months. We conducted multivariable logistic regression analyses to verify the association between various lipid profile changes and in-stent restenosis at 12 months.
RESULTS: Among the 100 patients included in the study (mean age, 60.8 Â± 10.0 years; male: 80 [80.0%]), in-stent restenosis was found in 13 (13.0%) patients. The risk of in-stent restenosis of more than 50% was significantly decreased when TC/HDL-C ratio (odds ratio [OR] 0.22, [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05-0.87]) and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio (OR 0.23, [95% CI 0.06-0.93]) decreased or when HDL-C levels (OR 0.10, [95% CI 0.02-0.63]) were increased at 12 months compared with baseline measurements.
CONCLUSIONS: Improvement of HDL-C levels, TC/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were associated with decreased risk of in-stent restenosis at 12-month follow-up. Management and careful monitoring of various lipid profiles including HDL-C levels, TC/HDL-C ratio, and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio may be important to prevent in-stent restenosis in patients with intracranial stenting.
