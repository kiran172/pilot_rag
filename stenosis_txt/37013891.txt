Title: Circulating HDAC4 reflects lipid profile, coronary stenosis and inflammation in coronary heart disease patients.

Abstract: Aim: To investigate the clinical value of HDAC4 in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Methods: The serum HDAC4 levels were determined by ELISA in 180 CHD patients and 50 healthy controls. Results: HDAC4 was decreased in CHD patients compared with healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001). HDAC4 was negatively linked with serum creatinine (p = 0.014), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.027) and C-reactive protein (p = 0.006) in CHD patients. Moreover, HDAC4 was inversely related to TNF-α (p = 0.012), IL-1β (p = 0.002), IL-6 (p = 0.034), IL-17A (p = 0.023), VCAM1 (p = 0.014) and Gensini score (p = 0.001). Unfortunately, neither HDAC4 high (vs low) (p = 0.080) nor HDAC4 quartile (p = 0.268) estimated major adverse cardiovascular event risk. Conclusion: Circulating HDAC4 levels have disease monitoring value but are less valuable in estimating prognosis in CHD patients.
