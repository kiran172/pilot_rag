Title: Management of an Acute Airway Obstruction Due to Tracheal Carcinoma in a Patient With Severe Glottic Stenosis.

Abstract: In this paper, we present the case of acute airway obstruction due to tracheal carcinoma in a patient with glottic stenosis due to previously treated laryngeal carcinoma. Because of severe dyspnea from the obstructive endotracheal mass, tracheotomy under local anesthesia was immediately performed. Intubation with pediatric size (I.D. 4.5 mm) cuffed endotracheal tube was performed by the surgeon through tracheostomy under endoscopic visualization. Blakesley forceps and electrocautery were used for tumor debulking. Postoperatively there were no complications and the patient was discharged after four days. The histopathology report showed a squamous cell carcinoma. The tumor board decided on adjuvant chemoradiotherapy for the treatment of the patient.
