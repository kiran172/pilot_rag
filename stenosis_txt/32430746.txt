Title: Coronary artery involvements in Takayasu arteritis: systematic review of reports.

Abstract: Coronary artery involvements in patients with Takayasu arteritis (TA) have not been sufficiently described. By comprehensive retrieval of the pertinent literature published in the past two decades, 59 reports including 141 patients were recruited into this study. In TA patients with coronary artery involvements, the right coronary artery was the most commonly affected. Stenosis was the most common coronary artery lesion, and the coronary ostium was the most commonly affected coronary segment. Acute myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 17 (12.1%) patients of this cohort. Patients receiving surgical treatment showed a higher recovery rate than interventionally treated patients. Interventional therapy was associated with a higher reintervention rate than surgical treatment. The inflammation condition in TA patients can lead to in-stent restenosis and warrant reinterventions. Surgical treatment is a preferable treatment of choice over interventional therapy for the coronary artery lesions of TA patients.
