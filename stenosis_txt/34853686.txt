Title: Concomitant decalcification of the anterior mitral leaflet via the aortic annulus during aortic valve replacement for significant aortic and mitral stenoses.

Abstract: An 82-year-old man undergoing regular hemodialysis with substantial aortic and mitral valve stenoses underwent aortic valve replacement with concomitant mitral decalcification via the aortic annulus. Postoperative transthoracic echocardiography showed reduced mitral stenosis. The patient was discharged on the 14th postoperative day uneventfully.
