Title: Bibliometric Analysis of the Development, Current Status, and Trends in Adult Degenerative Scoliosis Research: A Systematic Review from 1998 to 2023.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS) research lacks bibliometric analysis, despite numerous studies. This study aimed to systematically analyze the development, current status, hot topics, frontier areas, and trends in ADS research.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted in the Web of Science Core Collection database from January 1998 to June 2023. Information regarding the country, institution, author, journal, and keywords was collected for each article. Bibliometric analysis was performed using VOSviewer and Citespace software.
RESULTS: The final analysis covered 1695 publications, demonstrating a steady increase in ADS research. The United States was the most prolific and influential country with 684 publications, followed by China and Japan. The University of California System was the most productive institution with 113 publications. Shaffrey, CI (47 publications) and Lenke, LG (41 publications) were top authors. The analysis revealed seven main research clusters: "intervertebral disc", "adult spinal deformity", "lumbar fusion", "minimally invasive surgery", "navigation", "postoperative complications", and "mental retardation". Keywords with strong bursts of activity included degeneration, prevalence, imbalance, classification, lumbar spinal stenosis, and kyphosis.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, in recent years, ADS research has undergone rapid development. This study analyzed its hot topics, advancements, and research directions, making it the latest bibliometric analysis in this field. The findings aim to provide a new perspective and guidance for clinical practitioners and researchers.
