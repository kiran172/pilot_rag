Title: Reliability of peak expiratory flow percentage compared to endoscopic grading in subglottic stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of pulmonary function testing compared to endoscopic grading in the assessment of subglottic stenosis.
METHODS: Consecutively treated patients with subglottic stenosis at a tertiary care specialty hospital from 2009 to 2019 were identified. Two fellowship-trained laryngologists and two otolaryngologists blinded to clinical history reviewed laryngo tracheoscopic examinations and assessed the degree of stenosis using the Cotton-Myer grading system (% stenosis). Nine full flow-volume loops were performed at the time of each exam.
RESULTS: The endoscopic images of 45 subjects were graded for degree of stenosis and the spirometry data were analyzed. The kappa values for Cotton-Myer grade overall was 0.37, grade I was -0.103, grade II was 0.052, and grade III was 0.045. The overall intraclass correlation of the physician grading of estimated percent obstruction (% stenosis) was 0.712 (P &lt; .01) whereas the overall intraclass correlation for PEF% was 0.96 (P &lt; .01). Within each Cotton-Myer grade, the intraclass correlation for % stenosis was 0.45 (P = .02) for grade I, 0.06 (P = .30) for grade II, and 0.16 (P = .03) for grade III. The intraclass correlation for PEF% for grade I was 0.97 (P &lt; .01), grade II was 0.92 (P &lt; .01), and grade III was 0.96 (P &lt; .01).
CONCLUSION: Cotton-Myer grading and estimating percent obstruction (% stenosis) for adult subglottic stenosis showed poor reliability as an assessment tool compared to the excellent intraclass correlation seen with pulmonary function tests within each Cotton-Myer grade subgroup. We recommend pulmonary function testing, specifically PEF% because it is a normalized value, for the assessment and management of subglottic stenosis.
