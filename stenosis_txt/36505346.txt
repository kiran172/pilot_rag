Title: The quality of guidelines for treatment of carotid artery disease: a critical appraisal using the AGREE II instrument.

Abstract: Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) are structured recommendations based on systematic reviews of the available evidence and are useful tools to support clinical decision-making. However, studies have raised concerns about the methodological and scientific quality of several CPG, which can affect their application in clinical practice. The objective of this study was to perform a systematic appraisal of the methodological quality of carotid atherosclerotic disease clinical guidelines, published from 2000 to 2019, using the AGREE II instrument (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation Instrument II). The appraisers independently assessed the quality of the CPG included in the study for each of the 6 domains of the AGREE II tool. The CPG were rated as high, moderate, or low quality using a points scale. A total of 9 CPGs were selected for appraisal. Except for domain 2 (kappa=0.715), excellent agreement was observed between the appraisers (kappa>0.75). Five of the CPGs were rated as high overall methodological quality rating, 5 were rated as moderate overall methodological quality, and 2 were rated low overall methodological quality. The authors conclude that: (1) appraisal of carotid atherosclerotic disease clinical guidelines using the AGREE II instrument is feasible, with a high degree of agreement among appraisers; and (2) that most CPGs on the management of atherosclerotic carotid disease have high methodological quality.
