Title: Long-Term Risk of Stroke After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: Insights From the SwissTAVI Registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stroke after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. Predictors of stroke and the long-term risk after TAVR remain incompletely understood.
OBJECTIVES: The authors sought to investigate the short- and long-term incidence and predictors of stroke after TAVR in the SwissTAVI Registry.
METHODS: Between February 2011 and June 2021, consecutive patients undergoing TAVR were included. Standardized stroke ratios (SSRs) were calculated to compare trends in stroke of TAVR patients with an age- and sex-matched general population in Switzerland derived from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease study.
RESULTS: A total of 11,957 patients (81.8 ± 6.5 years of age, 48.0% female) were included. One-third of the patients (32.3%) had a history of atrial fibrillation, and 11.8% had a history of cerebrovascular accident. The cumulative 30-day incidence rate of stroke was 3.0%, with 69% of stroke events occurring within the first 48 hours after TAVR. The incidence of stroke was 4.3% at 1 year, and 7.8% at 5 years. Compared with an age- and sex-adjusted general population, the risk of stroke was significantly higher in the TAVR population during the first 2 years after TAVR: first year: SSR 7.26 (95% CI: 6.3-8.36) and 6.82 (95% CI: 5.97-7.79) for males and females, respectively; second year: SSR 1.98 (95% CI: 1.47-2.67) and 1.48 (95% CI: 1.09-2.02) for males and females, respectively; but returned to a comparable level to that observed in the matched population thereafter.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with an age- and sex-matched population, TAVR patients experienced a higher risk of stroke for up to 2 years after the procedure, and a comparable risk thereafter. (SwissTAVI Registry; NCT01368250).
