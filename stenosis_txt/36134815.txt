Title: STAPLED HEMORRHOIDOPEXY: RESULTS, LATE COMPLICATIONS, AND DEGREE OF SATISFACTION AFTER 16 YEARS OF FOLLOW-UP.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy has been widely used for the treatment of hemorrhoids, but concerns about complications and recurrences after prolonged follow-up are still under debate.
AIMS: The aim of this study was to evaluate the very long-term results of the stapled hemorrhoidopexy technique.
METHODS: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy was performed on 155 patients between 2000 and 2003, and the early results have already been published. In this study, we evaluated the same patients after a very long follow-up. Data were collected with regard to late complications, rate and timing of recurrences, and patients' degree of satisfaction.
RESULTS: From a total of 155 patients, 98 patients were evaluated: 59 (60.2%) were interviewed by telephone and 39 (39.8%) were evaluated by outpatient consultation. The mean follow-up was 193 months (range: 184-231), 52 were female, 52 were grade III hemorrhoids, and 46 were grade IV. Recurrence was higher in grade IV (26.1%) than in grade III (7.7%) (p=0.014). Recurrence after prolonged follow-up was seen in 16 patients (16.3%) and 11 (11.2%) required reoperations. The complications were skin tags (3.1%), anal sub-stenosis (2.1%), and fecal incontinence (2.1%). After a prolonged follow-up, 82.5% of patients were either very satisfied or satisfied with the surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Stapled hemorrhoidopexy is a safe and effective treatment for hemorrhoidal disease grades III and IV. Recurrence is higher for grade IV hemorrhoids and may occur up to 9 years of follow-up. Reoperations were infrequent and there is a high patient's degree of satisfaction associated with this technique.
