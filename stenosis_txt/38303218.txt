Title: [A Rare Case of Cronkhite-Canada Syndrome Associated with Gastric Cancer and Gastric Outlet Obstruction].

Abstract: Cronkhite-Canada syndrome(CCS)is a rare non-inherited disease characterized by gastrointestinal polyposis and ectodermal abnormalities. We report a rare case of CCS associated with gastric cancer and gastric outlet obstruction with a review of the literature. A 75-year-old man was admitted because of frequent vomiting and hypoproteinemia. He was diagnosed with CCS due to typical clinical and laboratory findings including alopecia, nail atrophy, hypoproteinemia, and typical gastrointestinal polyposis. Upper endoscopic examination also pointed out a large gastric cancer mainly located in the antrum and the reversible pyloric obstruction caused by the gastric tumor. Biopsy of the tumor revealed tubular adenocarcinoma. Computed tomography demonstrated the dilated duodenum caused by packing of the gastric tumor. 1.5 months after prednisolone therapy, he underwent total gastrectomy with complete resection of the dilated duodenal bulb. Histological examination revealed gastric cancer(pap>tub1)classified into Stage â…¢C. Postoperative course was uneventful and he moved to another hospital. To our knowledge, including the present case, there were 20 reported cases of CCS associated with gastric cancer from Japan(1979-2022). Also, 7 cases of CCS associated with gastric outlet obstruction was reported.
