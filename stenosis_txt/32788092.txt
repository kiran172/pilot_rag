Title: Transradial Secondary Approach During Transfemoral TAVI: Usefulness of Placing a Wire Before Femoral Puncture for Management and Treatment of Vascular Complications.

Abstract: Vascular complications during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are relatively common, and some of them related to the transfemoral secondary access. The use of the transradial access (TRA) as an alternative vascular approach for transfemoral TAVI could reduce these complications, however, the treatment of potential vascular peripheral issues from this access has been scarcely described. The advance of a wire from the TRA to the primary transfemoral access at the beginning of the procedure could help the management of eventual vascular complications. A new TRA technique during transfemoral TAVI procedures is described, reporting the results in the first forty-two patients in one center.
