Title: Comparison of Mechanical Forces used in Open Tracheotomy versus Percutaneous Tracheotomy Techniques.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To understand the etiology of tracheotomy-induced tracheal stenosis by comparing the differences in techniques and mechanical force applied with open tracheotomy (OT) versus percutaneous tracheotomy (PCT) placement.
METHODS: This study is an unblinded, experimental, randomized controlled study in an ex-vivo animal model. Simulated tracheostomies were performed on 10 porcine tracheas, 5 via a tracheal window technique (OT) and 5 using the Ciaglia technique (PCT). The applied weight during the simulated tracheostomy and the compression of the trachea were recorded at set times during the procedure. The applied weight during tracheostomy was used to calculate the tissue force in Newtons. Tracheal compression was measured by anterior-posterior distance compression and as percent change.
RESULTS: Average forces for scalpel (OT) versus trocar (PCT) were 2.6 N and 12.5 N (p < 0.01), with the dilator (PCT) it was 22.02 N (p < 0.01). The tracheostomy placement with OT required an average force of 10.7 N versus 23.2 N (p < 0.01) with PCT. The average change in AP distance when using the scalpel versus trocar was 21%, and 44% (p < 0.01), with the dilator it was 75% (p < 0.01). The trach placement with OT versus PCT had an average AP distance change of 51% and 83% respectively (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that PCT required more force and caused more tracheal lumen compression when compared to the OT technique. Based on the increased force required for PCT, we suspect there could also be an increased risk for tracheal cartilage trauma.
