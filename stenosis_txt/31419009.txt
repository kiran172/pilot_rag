Title: Impact of diastolic dysfunction on long-term mortality and quality of life after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is conflicting data as to whether diastolic dysfunction (DD) affects the prognosis of patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR underwent assessment of DD with preoperative echocardiography and NT-pro BNP. Long-term survival was ascertained every 6 months by clinic visits or phone. DD was graded according to the new American Society of Echocardiography recommendations. Health status was assessed at baseline and 30 days post-procedure using the KCCQ-12 questionnaire. Long-term survival was displayed using Kaplan-Meier curves according to NT-pro BNP levels and DD grades.
RESULTS: We included 222 patients, mean age 78 (±8) years, median STS score 4 (interquartile range = 3-7), median follow-up time 385 days (IQR = 180-640). DD was absent in 25, Grade I in 13, Grade II in 74, Grade III in 24, and indeterminate in 86 patients. Advanced (Grades II-III) DD was associated with higher pre-procedural NT-pro BNP levels (p < .001), worse quality of life (p < .001) but similar surgical risk (p = .43). Advanced and indeterminate DD were associated with increased long-term mortality (25-28% vs. 5%, p = .02) and elevated NT-pro BNP levels (26.4% vs. 9.8%, p = .05). Improvements in quality of life measures were seen in all DD groups (median change in KCCQ score no or Grade I DD:14 [3-21] vs. Grades II-III DD: 15 [16-26; p = .37]).
CONCLUSION: Preoperative NT-pro BNP levels and echocardiographic indices of indeterminate or advanced DD are associated with increased long-term mortality after TAVR but similar improvements in quality of life.
