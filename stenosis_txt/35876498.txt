Title: Paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome in a neonate with CHD: case description and current issues in children with CHD.

Abstract: We present a case of possible vertical COVID-19 transmission-related paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome in a neonate with CHD. Myocarditis and supraventricular tachycardia along with hepatic injury and renal failure were diagnosed on a background of mild aortic valve stenosis; the patient was successfully treated with immunomodulation. Since paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome can affect the heart, we could consider neonates with haemodynamically insignificant CHD to be at a higher risk of fatal outcomes. Issues related to early diagnosis and management need to be addressed.
