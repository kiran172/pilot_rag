Title: Peripheral Vascular Complication of Transgender Reassignment Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gender-reassignment surgeries are technically challenging and associated with detrimental vascular complications.
METHODS: A 49 year-old female status-post phalloplasty presented with peripheral vascular complication resulting in disabling claudication. Initial anastomotic attempt was rendered nonviable to sustain the constructed phallus resulting in superficial femoral artery stenosis. Covered stent placement corrected the stenosis and alleviated the claudication.
RESULTS: As gender-reassignment surgeries increase, greater understanding of potential vascular complications is needed. Involvement of multidisciplinary teams is necessary to optimize patient safety and outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS: Vascular surgery should play a larger role in these complex revascularizations and vessel anastomoses to ensure quality blood flow to the reconstructed genitalia.
