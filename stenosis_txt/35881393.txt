Title: Incidence of Revision Surgery After Decompression With vs Without Fusion Among Patients With Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: IMPORTANCE: Only limited data derived from large prospective cohort studies exist on the incidence of revision surgery among patients who undergo operations for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS).
OBJECTIVE: To assess the cumulative incidence of revision surgery after 2 types of index operations-decompression alone or decompression with fusion-among patients with DLSS.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study analyzed data from a multicenter, prospective cohort study, the Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study, which included patients aged 50 years or older with DLSS at 8 spine surgery and rheumatology units in Switzerland between December 2010 and December 2015. The follow-up period was 3 years. Data for this study were analyzed between October and November 2021.
EXPOSURES: All patients underwent either decompression surgery alone or decompression with fusion surgery for DLSS.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was the cumulative incidence of revision operations. Secondary outcomes included changes in the following patient-reported outcome measures: Spinal Stenosis Measure (SSM) symptom severity (higher scores indicate more pain) and physical function (higher scores indicate more disability) subscale scores and the EuroQol Health-Related Quality of Life 5-Dimension 3-Level questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L) summary index score (lower scores indicate worse quality of life).
RESULTS: A total of 328 patients (165 [50.3%] men; median age, 73.0 years [IQR, 66.0-78.0 years]) were included in the analysis. Of these, 256 (78.0%) underwent decompression alone and 72 (22.0%) underwent decompression with fusion. The cumulative incidence of revisions after 3 years of follow-up was 11.3% (95% CI, 7.4%-15.1%) for the decompression alone group and 13.9% (95% CI, 5.5%-21.5%) for the fusion group (log-rank P = .60). There was no significant difference in the need for revision between the 2 groups over time (unadjusted absolute risk difference, 2.6% [95% CI, -6.3% to 11.4%]; adjusted absolute risk difference, 3.9% [95% CI, -5.2% to 17.0%]; adjusted hazard ratio, 1.40 [95% CI, 0.63-3.13]). The number of revisions was significantly associated with higher SSM symptom severity scores (β, 0.171; 95% CI, 0.047-0.295; P = .007) and lower EQ-5D-3L summary index scores (β, -0.061; 95% CI, -0.105 to -0.017; P = .007) but not with higher SSM physical function scores (β, 0.068; 95% CI, -0.036 to 0.172; P = .20). The type of index operation was not significantly associated with the corresponding outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This cohort study showed no significant association between the type of index operation for DLSS-decompression alone or fusion-and the need for revision surgery or the outcomes of pain, disability, and quality of life among patients after 3 years. Number of revision operations was associated with more pain and worse quality of life.
