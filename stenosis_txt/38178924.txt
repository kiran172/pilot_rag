Title: Establishment of a novel mouse model of renal artery coiling-based chronic hypoperfusion-related kidney injury.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis-induced chronic renal ischemia is an important cause of renal dysfunction, especially in older adults, and its incidence is currently increasing. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying chronic renal hypoperfusion-induced kidney damage, we developed a novel mouse model of renal artery coiling-based chronic hypoperfusion-related kidney injury. This model exhibits decreased renal blood flow and function, atrophy, and parenchymal injury in the coiled kidney, along with compensatory hypertrophy in the non-coiled kidney, without chronic hypertension. The availability of this mouse model, which can develop renal ischemia without genetic modification, will enhance kidney disease research by serving as a new tool to investigate the effects of acquired factors (e.g., obesity and aging) and genetic factors on renal artery stenosis-related renal parenchymal damage.
