Title: Managing Rheumatic Heart Disease in Pregnancy: A Practical Evidence-Based Multidisciplinary Approach.

Abstract: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) remains a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in pregnant patients in low- to middle-income countries. Apart from the clinical challenges, these areas face poor infrastructure and resources to allow for early detection, with many women presenting to medical services for the first time when they deteriorate clinically during the pregnancy. The opportunity for preconception counselling and planning may thus be lost. It is ideal for all women to be seen before conception and risk-stratified according to their clinical state and pathology. The role of the cardio-obstetrics team has emerged over the past decade with the aim of a seamless transition to and from the appropriate levels of care during pregnancy. Severe symptomatic mitral and aortic valve stenoses portend the greatest risk to both mother and fetus. In mitral stenosis, beta-blockers are the cornerstone of therapy and only a small number of patients require balloon valvuloplasty. Regurgitant lesions mostly require diuretics alone for the treatment of heart failure. The mode of delivery is usually vaginal; caesarean section is performed in those with obstetrical indications or in cases with severe stenosis and a poor clinical state. The postpartum period presents a second high-risk period for maternal adverse events, with heart failure and arrhythmias being the most frequent. This review aims to provide a practical evidence-based multi-disciplinary approach to the management of women with RHD in pregnancy.
