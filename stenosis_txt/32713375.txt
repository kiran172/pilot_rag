Title: Cochlear nerve canal stenosis and associated semicircular canal abnormalities in paediatric sensorineural hearing loss: a single centre study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the association between cochlear nerve canal dimensions and semicircular canal abnormalities and to determine the distribution of bony labyrinth anomalies in patients with cochlear nerve canal stenosis.
METHOD: This was a retrospective study in which high-resolution computed tomography images of paediatric patients with severe-to-profound sensorineural hearing loss were reviewed. A cochlear nerve canal diameter of 1.5 mm or less in the axial plane was classified as stenotic. Semicircular canals and other bony labyrinth morphology and abnormality were evaluated.
RESULTS: Cochlear nerve canal stenosis was detected in 65 out of 265 ears (24 per cent). Of the 65 ears, 17 ears had abnormal semicircular canals (26 per cent). Significant correlation was demonstrated between cochlear nerve canal stenosis and semicircular canal abnormalities (p < 0.01). Incomplete partition type II was the most common accompanying abnormality of cochlear nerve canal stenosis (15 out of 65, 23 per cent).
CONCLUSION: Cochlear nerve canal stenosis is statistically associated with semicircular canal abnormalities. Whenever a cochlear nerve canal stenosis is present in a patient with sensorineural hearing loss, the semicircular canal should be scrutinised for presence of abnormalities.
