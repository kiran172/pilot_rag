Title: Endovascular treatment of Takayasu arteritis in a middle-aged woman with syncope and limb claudication: a case report.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a disease that causes inflammation and stenosis of medium to large blood vessels. We report a case of a 50-year-old female patient with newly developed hypertension, syncope, and claudication of the extremities. Total occlusion of the left subclavian artery at the origin was found and significant stenosis of the right common iliac artery was revealed by hemodynamic analysis. She was successfully treated with percutaneous angioplasty for multiple peripheral arterial diseases and was finally diagnosed with TA. In consultation with a rheumatologist, medical treatment for TA was initiated, the patient's hypertension disappeared, and her claudication symptoms improved.
