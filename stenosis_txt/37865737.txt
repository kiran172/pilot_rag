Title: The utility of self-expanding metal stents in benign biliary strictures- a retrospective case series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Benign biliary strictures can have a significant negative impact on patient quality of life. There are several modalities which can be utilized with the goal of stricture resolution. These techniques include balloon dilatation, placement of multiple plastic stents and more recently, the use of metal stents. The aim of this study was to evaluate the local success of self-expanding metal stents in successfully resolving benign biliary strictures.
METHODS: This was a single institution, retrospective case series. Patients included in our study were patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography with placement of self expanding metal stents for benign biliary strictures at our institution between 2016-2022. Patients were excluded for the following: malignant stricture, and inability to successfully place metal stent. Data was evaluated using two-sided t-test with 95% confidence interval.
RESULTS: A total of 31 patients underwent placement of 43 self-expanding metal stents and met inclusion criteria. Mean age of patients was 59 ± 10 years, and were largely male (74.2% vs. 25.8%). Most strictures were anastomotic stricture post liver transplant (87.1%), while the remainder were secondary to chronic pancreatitis (12.9%). Complications of stent placement included cholangitis (18.6%), pancreatitis (2.3%), stent migration (20.9%), and inability to retrieve stent (4.7%). There was successful stricture resolution in 73.5% of patients with anastomotic stricture and 33.3% of patients with stricture secondary to pancreatitis. Resolution was more likely if stent duration was > / = 180 days (73.3% vs. 44.4%, p < 0.05). There was no demonstrated added benefit when stent duration was > / = 365 days (75% vs. 60.9%, p = 0.64).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that self expanding metal stents are a safe and effective treatment for benign biliary strictures, with outcomes comparable to plastic stents with fewer interventions. This study indicates that the optimal duration to allow for stricture resolution is 180-365 days.
