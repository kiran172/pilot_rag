Title: An autopsy case of retrograde in situ branched stent grafting for a complex aortic arch aneurysm.

Abstract: Although retrograde in situ branched stent grafting (RIBS) is one possible treatment option for thoracic aortic aneurysms, concerns exist regarding the durability of the stent graft (SG) at the junction between the main SG and the branched SG. We report on the autopsy results of a patient treated with RIBS for a complex aortic arch aneurysm. The patient had died of a nonaortic cause 14 months after the RIBS procedure. On computed tomography analysis and a leak test, the harvested SG was intact without any stent fracture, stenosis, or junctional leak at 1 atm water pressure (760 mm Hg).
