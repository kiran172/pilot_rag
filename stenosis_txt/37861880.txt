Title: Hydrogen sulfide inhibits gene expression associated with aortic valve degeneration by inducing NRF2-related pro-autophagy effect in human aortic valve interstitial cells.

Abstract: Aortic valve stenosis (AS) is the most common valvular heart disease but there are currently no effective medical treatments that can delay disease progression due to a lack of knowledge of the precise pathophysiology. The expression of sulfide: quinone oxidoreductase (SQOR) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) was decreased in the aortic valve of AS patients. However, the role of SQOR and NRF2 in the pathophysiology of AS has not been found. We investigated the effects of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S)-releasing compounds on diseased aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) to explain the cellular mechanism of SQOR and elucidate the medical value of H<sub>2</sub>S for AS treatment. Sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) treatment increased the expression of SQOR and NRF2 gene and consequently induced the NRF2 target genes, such as NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 and cystathionine γ-lyase. In addition, NaHS dose-dependently decreased the expression level of fibrosis and inflammation-related genes (MMP9, TNF-α, IL6) and calcification-related genes (ALP, osteocalcin, RUNX2, COL1A1) in human AVICs. Furthermore, NaHS activated the AMPK-mTOR pathway and inhibited the PI3K-AKT pathway, resulting in a pro-autophagy effect in human AVICs. An NRF2 inhibitor, brusatol, attenuated NaHS-induced AMPK activation and decreased the autophagy markers Beclin-1 and LC3AB, suggesting that the mechanism of action of H<sub>2</sub>S is related to NRF2. In conclusion, H<sub>2</sub>S decreased gene expression levels related to aortic valve degeneration and activated AMPK-mTOR-mediated pro-autophagy function associated with NRF2 in human AVICs. Therefore, H<sub>2</sub>S could be a potential therapeutic target for the development of AS treatment.
