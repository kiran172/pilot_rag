Title: Management of supravalvular aortic stenosis with the Doty technique, in a South American pediatric center.

Abstract: Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS) is a congenital malformation associated with Williams-Beuren syndrome. It is characterized by severe stenosis of the sinotubular junction. The smooth muscle layer is thickened due to an alteration of the Elastin gene. The treatment is surgical and there are several techniques to relieve obstruction which range from the single-patch technique to the replacement of all three aortic sinuses with three patches. However, the optimal technique is still unclear. The objective of this article is to carry out a bibliographic review of surgical techniques for SVAS and the description of the application of the Doty technique for a 4-year-old infant at the Roberto Gilbert Elizalde Hospital.
