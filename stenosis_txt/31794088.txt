Title: Assessment of right ventricular dysfunction in patients with mitral stenosis: A speckle tracking study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Although it is affected at an early stage, there is a lack of studies investigating right ventricular (RV) function in patients with mitral stenosis (MS). We aimed to investigate the correlation between conventional echocardiographic variables and tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), used as an indicator of RV dysfunction.
METHODS: We enrolled 59 consecutive patients with MS and assigned them in group 1 if TAPSE ≤16, or group 2 if: TAPSE >16.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 42.2 ± 8 years, and 74.6% were females. In univariate analysis, maximal mitral valve gradient, mean mitral valve gradient, systolic pulmonary arterial pressure, RV strain, and RV strain rates were associated with RV dysfunction. In multivariate analysis, both strain variables were found to be independent predictors of RV dysfunction. Kaplan Maier survival analysis showed that patients with lower RV strain had more rehospitalization rate during the one-year follow-up period.
CONCLUSIONS: RV dysfunction is common in patients with MS and is associated with higher rehospitalization rate and morbidity. Evaluation of RV strain and strain rate for early detection of RV dysfunction and prediction of rehospitalization may be an appropriate approach in mitral stenosis.
