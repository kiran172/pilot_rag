Title: Outcomes of Transcatheter Versus Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement in Patients <60 Years of Age.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an alternative therapeutic modality to surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). In the current analysis, we compare the characteristics and outcomes of AVR procedures in patients <60 years of age.
METHODS: We queried the Nationwide Readmissions Database for all AVR hospitalizations in patients 18-59 years of age between January 2012 and December 2017. We performed a propensity score matching analysis (1:1) and compared baseline characteristics, procedural complications, and outcomes between TAVR and SAVR patients.
RESULTS: A total of 72,356 hospitalizations for AVR were identified in patients <60 years of age. Compared to their SAVR counterparts, TAVR patients were older (52.5 ± 7.6) vs. 48.8 ± 9.6, p < 0.001), more likely to be women (37.9% vs. 28.0%, p < 0.001), and have history of prior radiation (8.3% vs. 0.7%, p < 0.001). After propensity score matching, TAVR patients had lower procedural complications, but a similar mortality rate compared to SAVR patients (2.9% vs. 3.0%, p = 0.77). TAVR was associated with a shorter length of hospital stay [4 [2-9] vs. 6 [5-11], p < 0.001), but no significant difference in the 30-day readmission rate was noted (16.2% vs. 16.8%, p-value = 0.49).
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates favorable short-term outcomes in younger patients undergoing TAVR, which improved over time. Further investigation of long-term outcomes in TAVR performed younger patients is warranted to draw a comprehensive picture of TAVR safety and efficacy in low-risk patients.
