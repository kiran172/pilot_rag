Title: Outcome Factors for Women Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Women with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) have a higher burden of symptoms, are older at the time of the TAVR procedure, and have unique anatomic features that increase the periprocedural risk. However, long-term outcomes including mortality are favorable for women compared with men. Careful attention is needed in considering the vascular access route and choice of valve platform to mitigate complications. Large prospective trials dedicated to women undergoing TAVR are needed to investigate individual female-specific factors determining outcomes.
