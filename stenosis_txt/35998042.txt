Title: Posterior Glottic Injury Following Prolonged Intubation in COVID-19 Patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to characterize the risk factors for posterior glottic injury (PGI) in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who underwent prolonged intubation.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a case-control study designed to assess the risk factors associated with development of PGI in COVID-19 patients who underwent prolonged intubation.
SETTING: This single-center study was conducted at a tertiary care academic hospital in a metropolitan area.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent prolonged intubation (â‰¥7 days) for COVID-19 and compared those with PGI to those without. Patient demographics, comorbidities, and intubation characteristics were compared. Factors associated with PGI development among COVID-19 patients were assessed using multivariate regression.
RESULTS: We identified 56 patients who presented with PGI following prolonged intubation for COVID-19 and 60 control patients who underwent prolonged intubation for COVID-19 but did not develop PGI. On univariate analyses, the number of reintubations due to failed extubation efforts was significantly associated with development of PGI (odds ratio [OR], 2.9; 95% CI, 1.4-6.2). On multivariate analyses, patients with cardiovascular disease (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.2-9.0); non-COVID-19 respiratory illnesses, which included obstructive sleep apnea and asthma (OR, 5.9; 95% CI, 2.0-17.8); and diabetes mellitus (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 3.7-36.6) were more likely to develop PGI.
CONCLUSION: Our results represent the largest case-control study investigating risk factors for PGI in the setting of prolonged intubation specific to COVID-19. Our study suggests a significant role of comorbidities associated with poor wound healing with development of PGI.
