Title: Gender-Tailored Heart Team Decision Making Equalizes Outcomes for Female Patients after Aortic Valve Replacement through Right Anterior Small Thoracotomy (RAST).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little is known about gender-dependent outcomes after aortic valve replacement (AVR) through right anterior thoracotomy (RAST). The aim of our study was to analyze the mid-term outcomes of our cohort.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective analysis of 338 patients (2013-2022). Subgroup analysis included a gender-dependent comparison of age groups ≤60 and >60 years.
RESULTS: Women were older (69.27 ± 7.98 vs. 64.15 ± 11.47, p &lt; 0.001) with higher Euroscore II (1.25 ± 0.73 vs. 0.94 ± 0.45, p &lt; 0.001). Bypass and cross-clamp time were shorter (109.36 ± 30.8 vs. 117.65 ± 33.1 minutes, p = 0.01; 68.26 ± 21.5 vs. 74.36 ± 23.3 minutes, p = 0.01), while ICU, hospital stay and atrial fibrillation were higher (2.48 ± 8.2 vs. 1.35 ± 1.4 days, p = 0.005; 11 ± 7.8 vs. 9.48 ± 2.3 days, p = 0.002; 6.7% vs. 4.4%, p = 0.024). Mortality was 0.9%, while stroke was 0.6%. Age subgroup analysis showed that women were older (p = 0.025) with longer ICU and hospital stays (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.007). On mid-term follow-up (4.52 ± 2.67 years) of 315 patients (94.3%), there was no significant difference in survival, MACCE and re-intervention comparing gender and age groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite older age, higher Euroscore II, longer ICU and hospital stay in women, mortality, MACCE and reoperation were low and comparable in gender and age groups. We believe that our patient-tailored heart team decision making combined with RAST translates into gender-tailored medicine, which equalizes the widely reported negative outcomes of female patients after cardiac surgery.
