Title: Left ventricular deformation in the presence of left ventricular 'rigid body rotation' in healthy adults-three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiographic insights from the MAGYAR-Healthy Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: During the heart cycle, the left ventricle (LV) not only shows a contraction-relaxation pattern, but LV has a rotational mechanics, as well. It is a known fact that certain pathologies may be associated with an absence of LV twist, when LV basal and apical regions rotate in the same clockwise (cw) or counterclockwise (ccw) direction called LV 'rigid body rotation' (LV-RBR), but it can also occur in healthy subjects. The present cohort study aimed to examine LV strains in healthy subjects with LV-RBR versus with normally directed LV rotational mechanics by three-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (3DSTE).
METHODS: The study consisted of 181 healthy individuals, from which 171 cases had normally directed LV rotational mechanics (mean age: 32.5±12.3 years, 79 males) and 10 healthy subject showed LV-RBR (mean age: 35.4±11.3 years, 3 males). Complete two-dimensional (2D) Doppler echocardiography and 3DSTE were performed in all healthy individuals.
RESULTS: None of routine 2D Doppler echocardiographic parameters showed differences between the groups examined. There were no subjects with ≥ grade 1 regurgitation on any valves or with significant stenosis on any valves. 3DSTE-derived LV volumes, global and mean segmental strains did not differ between the groups examined. Apical anterior and lateral segments showed reduced segmental LV circumferential strain (CS) (-18.9%±8.5% vs. -26.7%±10.7%, P=0.02; -27.3%±12.6% vs. -34.8%±13.2%, P=0.08, respectively) and LV area strain (AS) (-26.8%±9.8% vs -36.8%±12.0%, P=0.01; -35.7%±13.2% vs. -45.0%±14.6%) in healthy subjects having LV-RBR as compared to cases with normally directed LV rotational mechanics. These abnormalities were present only in subjects having cwLV-RBR.
CONCLUSIONS: Although global LV deformation is normal in the presence of LV-RBR in healthy adults, reduction of apical anterior and lateral LV-CS (and LV-AS) are present in cases with cwLV-RBR only suggesting segmental deformation abnormalities.
