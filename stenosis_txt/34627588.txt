Title: Real-world outcomes in treatment of highly calcified coronary lesions with intravascular shockwave lithotripsy.

Abstract: Real-world data regarding the efficacy and safety of coronary intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) are lacking. We conducted a study of 50 consecutive patients (64 lesions) who underwent IVL. 3 patients suffered in-hospital mortality unrelated to the IVL; there was no other occurrence of MACE up to 30 days. Angiographic success was nearly universal (98% of patients with residual stenosis <50%, 96% of patients with TIMI 3 flow) and complication was rare, including among patients undergoing IVL for in-stent restenosis or left main coronary artery lesions. In a high-risk real-world cohort, IVL was a safe and effective treatment for highly-calcified coronary lesions.
