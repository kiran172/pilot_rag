Title: A Case of TAV-in-SAV in a Patient with Structural Valve Deterioration after Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement with the INSPIRIS RESILIA Valve.

Abstract: The INSPIRIS RESILIA valve is designed to dilate its valve annulus in transcatheter aortic valve-in-surgical aortic valve (TAV-in-SAV), a catheter therapy for biological valve deterioration. RESILIA tissue has improved anti-calcification properties. An 83-year-old man on hemodialysis undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) with a 25-mm INSPIRIS for severe aortic stenosis 22 months ago presented with general malaise. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed severe bioprosthetic stenosis (peak velocity: 3.5 m/s, mean pressure gradient: 32 mmHg, and effective orifice area: 0.45 cm2) and severely reduced left ventricular function (ejection fraction: 17%). Because redo-SAVR was extremely risky (society of thoracic surgeons [STS] risk score: 31%), the patient underwent transfemoral-TAV-in-SAV using a 26-mm SAPIEN 3Ô∏è. Pre- and postoperative computed tomography showed that the internal diameter of the INSPIRIS had expanded from 22.2 mm to 24.2 mm. This case demonstrated the dilatable design of INSPIRIS but not the durability of RESILIA tissue.
