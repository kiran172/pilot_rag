Title: Impact of recent heart failure hospitalization on clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement: an analysis from the PARTNER 2 trial and registries.

Abstract: AIMS: Heart failure (HF) hospitalization prior to transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is associated with increased post-procedural mortality. We sought to assess the association between recent (≤6 months) HF hospitalization and long-term adverse outcomes in patients with symptomatic, severe aortic stenosis, undergoing TAVR in the PARTNER 2 trial and registries.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Intermediate to high or even prohibitive risk patients who underwent TAVR in the PARTNER 2 trial and registries were included in the analysis. Clinical outcomes at 30 days and 2 years were compared between patients according to whether they were recently hospitalized for HF, using Kaplan-Meier event rates and study-stratified multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using propensity score matching. Of 3988 patients (99.8%) with available information on recent HF hospitalization, 1622 patients (40.7%) were hospitalized for HF symptoms during the 6 months prior to TAVR. After multivariable adjustments, recent HF hospitalization was associated with increased all-cause mortality at 30 days [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.07-2.48, P = 0.02] and 2 years (adjusted HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.13-1.49, P = 0.0003), which was driven by increased cardiovascular mortality. Infective endocarditis rate at 2 years was also higher in patients with recent HF hospitalization (adjusted HR 2.35, 95% CI 1.38-4.01, P = 0.002). These results remained consistent when propensity score matching was used.
CONCLUSION: In a large cohort of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis from the PARTNER 2 trial and registries, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality as well as infective endocarditis rates at 2 years were higher in patients with recent HF hospitalization.
