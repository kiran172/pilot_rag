Title: The Incidence, Impact, and Techniques of Commissural Alignment in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: A Review.

Abstract: In current clinical practice, commissural alignment of the transcatheter heart valve (THV) during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is seldom achieved. Orientation of the THV within the aortic root and the subsequent influence upon leaflet haemodynamic function, coronary blood flow, and ease of access to the coronary ostia are gaining significant interest. Herein, we review the incidence and clinical implications of commissural misalignment in TAVI and offer thorough descriptions of how optimal alignment can be achieved with several different contemporary THV devices.
