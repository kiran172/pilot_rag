Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with unruptured aortic root pseudoaneurysm: an observational study.

Abstract: AIMS: Unruptured aortic root pseudoaneurysm (UARP) is a rare complication of aortic valve endocarditis. Infectious spread to the valvular annulus or myocardium can cause septic complications that manifest as wall thickening, and spontaneous abscess drainage leads to pseudoaneurysm formation. We report the first patient series in which transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using a single valve-resolved aortic valvulopathy associated with UARP was performed.
METHODS: At our center, from December 2017 to October 2019, 138 patients underwent TAVI for aortic valve stenosis and/or regurgitation, 20 of whom (12 female patients, 8 male patients) had associated incidental UARP and were considered as our study population. The average age of these patients was 76.9 ± 5.2 years. All patients were assessed using preprocedural and postprocedural multimodality imaging, including transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA).
RESULTS: In all cases, the final angiographic examination showed correct valve positioning with complete coverage of the false aneurysm. Post-TAVI CCTA showed presence of total or subtotal UARP thrombosis. The mean follow-up period was 17.5 months (12-23 months). During follow-up, imaging showed normal prosthetic valve function, no significant leakage (trace or mild), and complete UARP exclusion in all patients, without any complications.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, percutaneous valve positioning can simultaneously solve pseudoaneurysm complications by excluding the sac and promoting thrombosis.
