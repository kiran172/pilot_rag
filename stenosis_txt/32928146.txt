Title: Intracranial arterial stenosis associated with Hashimoto's disease: angiographic features and clinical outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hashimoto's disease has reportedly been associated with stroke; however, cerebrovascular morphology and clinical course remain poorly documented. The present study aimed to determine the angiographic features and clinical outcomes of intracranial arterial stenosis (IAS) associated with Hashimoto's disease in a retrospective cohort.
METHODS: Overall, 107 adult patients with IAS were screened for anti-thyroid antibodies; of these, 26 patients tested positive. The 42 affected hemispheres were classified into subgroups according to the steno-occlusion site and the development of abnormal collateral (moyamoya) vessels. These subgroups were dichotomized into moyamoya vessels positive (MM type) and negative (non-MM type). The initial presentation, IAS progression, and vascular events during the follow-up period were compared.
RESULTS: The following sites of stenosis were identified: the bifurcation of the internal carotid artery in 11 (26.2%), M1 or A1 in 29 (69.0%), and more distal (M2-M4/A2-A4) in 2 (4.8%) hemispheres. Further, 17 hemispheres were categorized into the MM type and 25 were classified into the non-MM type. During the follow-up period (mean 2.5 years), IAS progression was identified in 8 (32%) hemispheres of the non-MM type and 0 (0%) hemispheres of the MM type (p = 0.041). Ischemic attacks occurred in 5 (20.0%) hemispheres of the non-MM type (4.6%/year) and 0 hemispheres of the MM type (p = 0.08). Further, 4 (23.5%) hemispheres of the MM type experienced intracerebral hemorrhage, whereas none of the non-MM type hemorrhaged (p = 0.012).
CONCLUSIONS: Hashimoto's disease-associated IAS exhibits various angiographic morphologies, resulting in different clinical presentations. Screening for anti-thyroid antibodies and careful management based on vascular morphology appears important in adults with IAS.
