Title: Follow-up after carotid endarterectomy and stenting: What to look for and why.

Abstract: Duplex ultrasound testing after open or endovascular extracranial carotid artery interventions is a clinical practice guideline with a strong recommendation from the Society for Vascular Surgery. Neurologic outcomes are improved by the recognition of repair site stenosis or atherosclerotic disease progression in the unoperated carotid artery. The benefit of surveillance outweighs its risk because duplex testing is free of complications and accurate in the detection of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion. Surveillance for >70% ICA stenosis is recommended within 30 days of the procedure, then every 6 months for 2 years, and annually thereafter. Repair site and contralateral ICA stenosis classification should be based on angle-corrected pulsed Doppler measurements of peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV), and the ratio of PSV at the stenosis to a proximal, nondiseased common carotid artery (CCA) segment (ICA/CCA ratio). Interpretation criteria of PSV >300 cm/s, EDV >125 cm/s, and ICA/CCA ratio >4 predicts >70% repair site stenosis. Endovascular intervention is recommended for a carotid repair site stenosis based on the occurrence of an ipsilateral neurologic event and appropriate anatomy for angioplasty. For asymptomatic restenosis, intervention is based on stenosis progression to elevated PSV and EDV >70% stenosis threshold values and the patient is deemed high risk for stroke due to contralateral ICA occlusion or incomplete functional patency of the circle of Willis.
