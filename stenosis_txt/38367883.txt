Title: Concomitant transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis in patients undergoing TAVR for aortic stenosis: A systemic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a successful treatment for aortic stenosis (AS) patients, and previous studies indicate favorable outcomes for those with concomitant aortic stenosis and transthyretin-associated cardiac amyloidosis (TTRCA-AS). However, the impact of TAVR on more adverse outcomes in TTRCA-AS patients compared to those with AS alone is still uncertain, with conflicting findings reported in the literature.
METHODS: PubMed and Scopus were extensively searched from inception till August 2021. Studies were included if they reported data for prevalence and outcomes including mortality and cardiovascular-related hospitalization events in TTRCA-AS patients referred for TAVR. The data for these outcomes were pooled using a random effects model and forest plots were created.
RESULTS: After initially screening 146 articles, 6 were shortlisted for inclusion in our analysis. Pooled analysis demonstrated a 13.3% [95% CI: 10.9-16.5; p = 0.307] prevalence of TTRCA in patients with AS undergoing TAVR. The incidence of mortality and cardiovascular (CV) hospitalization in patients with TTRCA-AS undergoing TAVR were 28.3% [95% CI: 18.7-39.0, p = 0.478] and 21.1% [95% CI: 10.2-34.5, p = 0.211], respectively.
CONCLUSION: The overall pooled TTRCA-AS prevalence was reported to be 13.3% in AS patients who underwent TAVR. Furthermore, transthyretin-associated CA was found to be associated with an increased risk of mortality and hospitalization. Large patient population studies are required to assess the safety and efficacy of TAVR in TTRCA-AS patients, as current research report data from small patient cohorts.
