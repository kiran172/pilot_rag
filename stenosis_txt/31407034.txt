Title: Surgical intervention for hydrocephalus in infancy; etiology, age and treatment data in a Dutch cohort.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To gain insight into the patient characteristics of surgically treated hydrocephalus in the Netherlands, we report the first data from the Dutch Quality Registry NeuroSurgery (QNRS) database for infants with hydrocephalus requiring surgical intervention.
METHODS: We used the prospectively gathered database concerning infants ≤ 2 years of age surgically treated for hydrocephalus. We report data from start of registry, concerning etiology, age, and treatment of patients registered. We compared data with the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN), a multicenter network of pediatric neurosurgical institutions in North America.
RESULTS: A total of 359 operated infants was registered in the period from 2010 to 2017. A drop in patients registered was seen in 2015, possibly due to revisions of the database. Most infants were operated on between 1 and 6 months of age. Cause of hydrocephalus was predominantly intracranial hemorrhage, followed by congenital causes. The proportion of infants with aqueduct stenosis and myelomeningocele as cause of hydrocephalus stayed relatively stable during this period of registration. Initial shunting was performed in 40% and reservoir/ETV as initial treatment was done in 60%. In both groups, 50% needed revision surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: The first data concerning surgically treated pediatric hydrocephalus from a prospectively collected Dutch register are presented, showing similar results when comparing to the HCRN database.
