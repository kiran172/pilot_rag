Title: A Novel Earbud Detects Aortic Stenosis Murmur Before and After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Noninvasive infrasonic hemodynography using the MindMics earbuds captures low-frequency acoustic vibrations throughout the cardiac cycle. In an n-of-1 analysis, we propose a new method of assessing severe aortic stenosis by using infrasonic hemodynography to detect its characteristic systolic ejection murmur before and after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
