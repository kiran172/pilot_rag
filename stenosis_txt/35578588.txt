Title: Emergency Cervical Carotid Artery Stenting After Intravenous Thrombolysis in Patients With Hyperacute Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) is the mainstay of treatment for acute ischemic stroke to recanalize thrombosed intracranial vessels within 4.5 hours. Emergency carotid artery stenting for the treatment of acute stroke due to steno-occlusion of the proximal internal carotid artery (ICA) can improve symptoms, prevent neurological deterioration, and reduce recurrent stroke risk. The feasibility and safety of the combination therapy of IV rtPA and urgent carotid artery stenting have not been established.
METHODS: From November 2005 to October 2020, we retrospectively assessed patients who had undergone emergent carotid artery stenting after IV rtPA for hyperacute ischemic stroke due to steno-occlusive proximal ICA lesion. Hemorrhagic transformation, successful recanalization, modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 90 days, and stent patency at 3 and 12 months or longer were evaluated. Favorable outcome was defined as a 90-days mRS score of ≤ 2.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients with hyperacute stroke had undergone emergent carotid artery stenting after IV rtPA therapy. Their median age was 70 (67.5-73.5) years (94.7% men). Among 15 patients with an additional intracranial occlusion after flow restoration in the proximal ICA, a modified TICI grade ≥ 2b was achieved in 11 patients (73.3%). Hemorrhagic transformation occurred in five patients (26.3%); mortality rate was 5.7%. Eleven patients (57.9%) had favorable outcomes at 90 days. Stent patients (94.1%) maintained stent patency for ≥ 12 months.
CONCLUSION: We showed that emergent carotid artery stenting after IV rtPA therapy for hyperacute stroke caused by atherosclerotic proximal ICA steno-occlusion was feasible and safe.
