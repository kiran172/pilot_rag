Title: Cerebral Infarction and Recovery in a 12-Year-Old Child With Intracranial Fibromuscular Dysplasia.

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a congenital vascular anomaly resulting in arterial stenosis and weakening of typically medium-sized arteries. It is a noninflammatory, nonatherosclerotic arterial disease that affects most commonly the renal and internal carotid arteries, but intracranial FMD in the pediatric population is very rare. We report a young age-onset ischemic stroke patient with FMD affecting the middle cerebral artery (MCA). A 14-year-old boy was admitted with left-side weakness during physical education at school. The brain magnetic resonance (MR) imaging revealed an acute ischemic stroke in the right basal ganglia and internal capsule, while the MR angiogram showed segmental intraluminal stenosis in the left proximal MCA. The transfemoral angiography revealed the pathognomonic sign of a "string of beads" at the proximal MCA area. The clinical course was stable, and the boy gradually recovered from the motor weakness of his arm and leg. FMD should be considered as a potential cause of pediatric stroke.
