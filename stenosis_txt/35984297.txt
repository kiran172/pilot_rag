Title: Liver fluke eggs in bile duct brush cytology: An unexpected diagnosis during evaluation of a biliary stricture.

Abstract: Clonorchis sinensis, a liver fluke parasite, infects humans through ingestion of raw or undercooked fish, crabs, or crayfish in endemic areas where the parasite is found. Clonorchis sinensis infects the liver, gallbladder, and bile duct in humans, causing Clonorichiasis. Although the majority of patients are asymptomatic, long-lasting infections may cause severe disease. Without treatment, human infection may persist for the parasite's lifespan (25-30â€‰years). Pathologic diagnosis can be challenging as sampling may demonstrate limited cellularity with minuscule eggs that may be overlooked. Here, we report a rare case of liver fluke eggs diagnosed in bile duct brush cytology.
