Title: Does local injection of long acting corticosteroid improve postoperative outcome of hypospadias repair? A randomized controlled trial.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess the safety and efficacy of local corticosteroid injection during hypospadias repair.
METHODS: Between May 2021 and March 2023 children less than 10 years who were admitted for hypospadias repair were divided by random allocation into two groups. We injected local corticosteroid 2 ml proximal to coronal sulcus in group A while in group B we didn't. All types of hypospadias were included in the study. We excluded patients older than 10 years and those with pre-existing complicated hypospadias (multiple fistulae and multiple surgeries), or bleeding diatheses. Pre-operative, intraoperative and postoperative variables were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: A total of 120 patients (60 in each group) were enrolled in the study. The mean ages and preoperative variables were not significantly different. The site of hypospadias and the type of surgery were comparable in both groups. (Table) There were no significant differences between both groups regarding average blood loss and operative time in each type of surgical repair. There was a significant higher incidence of intraoperative and postoperative penile oedema in group B (P-value < 0.001) while the incidence of skin discolouration was higher in group A. Postoperative complications, described as Clavian classification, were significantly higher in group B. The incidences of superficial skin infection, meatal stenosis, urethral fistula, and recurrence with the need for redo repair were significantly higher in group B (P-value: 0.002, 0.018, 0.032, and 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Local corticosteroid injection during hypospadias repair minimize the penile oedema and decrease the incidence of postoperative functional and cosmetic complications.
