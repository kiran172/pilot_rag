Title: [Meta-analysis of the results of eversion carotid endarterectomy and endarterectomy with patch plasty].

Abstract: AIM: The study was aimed at comparing the results of eversion carotid endarterectomy and carotid endarterectomy with patch plasty in the immediate and remote postoperative periods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The literature was retrieved by means of electronic databases, with the dates of publications ranging from 1970 to 2019. According to the inclusion and exclusion criteria we selected the literature making it possible to carry out a meta-analysis in the immediate and remote postoperative periods. The results were obtained with the help of the Stata 14 software package. Eventually, we retrieved and analysed a total of 2139 articles. Of these, ten were included into the study and contained 3568 patients subjected to 3672 operations (eversion carotid endarterectomy - 1718 and carotid endarterectomy with a patch - 1954). The results of the meta-analysis were as follows: the mean time of carotid artery cross-clamping for eversion carotid endarterectomy was shorter than that for carotid endarterectomy with a patch (4.1Â±2.9 min); the frequency of using intraoperative temporary bypass in eversion carotid endarterectomy turned out to be significantly less compared with carotid endarterectomy with patch plasty - 13.5% (91/672) and 62.0% (492/793), OR=0.183, 95% CI: 0.136-0.254, p<0.001; the incidence rate of ischaemic stroke in the immediate and remote postoperative periods was significantly lower after eversion carotid endarterectomy than that after carotid endarterectomy with patch plasty - OR=0.452, 95% CI: 0258-0.792, p=0.005 and OR=0.300, 95% CI; 0.155-0.579, p=0.000. The development of restenosis in the immediate and remote postoperative periods was observed less often for eversion carotid endarterectomy compared with carotid endarterectomy with patch plasty - OR=0.604, 95% CI: 0.422-0.864, p=0.006.
CONCLUSION: Eversion carotid endarterectomy was associated with shorter time of carotid artery cross-clamping, lower frequency of intraoperative temporary bypass, lower number of cases of ischaemic stroke in the immediate and remote postoperative periods, as well as those of restenosis in the long-term postoperative period.
