Title: Mortality Outcomes in Patients With Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices Before and After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) carries a risk of high-grade AV block requiring cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) implantation, which has been associated with a higher mortality rate. However, the outcomes of TAVR in patients with preexisting CIEDs are not well understood. We conducted a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who underwent TAVR from December 2014 to December 2019 at our institution. Patients were categorized into 3 groups: preexisting CIED pre-TAVR (group 1), CIED implanted within 30 days after TAVR (group 2), and no CIED implanted (group 3). Cox proportional hazard was conducted to determine the primary end point of all-cause mortality. A total of 366 patients were included, of whom 93 (25.4%), 51 (13.9%), and 222 (60.7%) comprised group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The median follow-up time was 2.3 years. The all-cause mortality rate was higher in group 1 than group 2 (hazard ratio [HR] 2.60, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09 to 6.18, p = 0.03) and group 3 (HR 1.96, 95% CI 1.24 to 3.08, p = 0.004). On the multivariate analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in mortality among the groups (group 1 vs group 2: HR 1.95, 95% CI 0.70 to 5.44, p = 0.20 and group 1 vs group 3: HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.66 to 2.43, p = 0.47). Preoperative hemoglobin ≤12 g/100 ml was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (HR 1.75, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.80, p = 0.02). Group 1 had a higher 1 year congestive heart failure readmission rate (29%) than group 2 (17.6%) and group 3 (8.1%; p <0.0001). In conclusion, there was no difference in the adjusted long-term survival based on the CIED grouping. However, patients with preexisting CIEDs had higher all-cause mortality and 1-year congestive heart failure readmission rates owing to their higher co-morbidity burden, irrespective of their Society of Thoracic Surgeons score. This can be taken into account for preoperative risk stratification.
