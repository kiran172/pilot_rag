Title: Surgical rescue mitral valve procedure post percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy-a single-center observational study.

Abstract: Percutaneous transluminal mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) has become the standard of care for severe mitral stenosis with favorable anatomy. Although the complications have reduced over the years, the need for emergency surgical rescue persists. This study evaluates the outcomes of surgical rescue performed within 24 h of undergoing PTMC from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2019. Out of 2259 PTMC patients, 22 patients (&lt; 1%) required rescue mitral valve surgery. Out of 22 patients, 17 patients (77.27%) developed mitral regurgitation; five patients (22.7%) had cardiac tamponade. Mitral valve replacement was performed in 20 patients (90.9%), while two patients (9.1%) underwent mitral valve repair. Cardiac tamponade was secondary to injury of the left atrium (9.1%), left ventricle (4.5%), and right ventricle (9.1%). Concomitant tricuspid valve repair was done in three patients (13.6%). Intraoperatively, anterior mitral leaflet tear was seen in 68.2% while posterior mitral leaflet tear was noted in 9.1%. Postoperatively, three patients (13.6%) required prolonged ventilation, incidence of stroke was 4.5% (n = 1), and in-hospital mortality was 4.5% (n = 1). Intra-aortic balloon pump was used in three patients (13.6%), preoperatively. We conclude that post-PTMC complications are rare, but they require urgent surgical intervention.
