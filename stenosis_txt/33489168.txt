Title: Complete ureteral stenosis after ureteroscopic lithotripsy successfully managed using a simultaneous retrograde and antegrade flexible ureteroscopic approach.

Abstract: Both retrograde and antegrade approach contributed to the success of a delicate endoscopic procedure. Even when guidewire did not pass thorough to the stenosis lesion, lightning and contrast reagents contributed the way through to the stenosis lesion.
