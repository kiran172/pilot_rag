Title: Back Pain and Right Leg Swelling: Unusual Presentations of May-Thurner Syndrome.

Abstract: May-Thurner (MT) syndrome refers to compression of the left common iliac vein by the right common iliac artery. Symptoms reported are generally left-sided leg swelling or pain. It is unusual for patients to report right-sided symptoms that are alleviated by treating MT compression. This case series describes three patients who had right-sided symptoms caused by left-sided venous compression. A retrospective chart review identified three patients over a year who presented with a variety of symptoms, including right-leg pain and swelling, and underwent treatment with left-sided venous compressions with a resolution of symptoms. Three patients were identified with right-sided back and flank pain. Venography with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) showed the MT compression was greater than 75% in each case (mean 80.3% with a range of 75.7%-95%), and all patients were treated by decompressing the venous outflow obstruction by stenting the left common iliac vein, which relieved their symptoms. Venous compressions that occur on the anatomical left side can lead to right-sided symptoms. In patients reporting right-sided back and flank pain, MT should be considered in the differential diagnosis.
