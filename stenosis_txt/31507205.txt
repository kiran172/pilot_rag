Title: Structural Analysis of the Retina and Choroid before and after Carotid Artery Surgery.

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate retinal and choroidal changes in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis who had undergone carotid artery stenting or endarterectomy.Methods: The study included 43 patients with internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis that required stenting or endarterectomy and 40 healthy controls. Patients were divided into two groups according to the degree of stenosis evaluated by magnetic resonance angiography. Group 1 consisted of patients having ICA stenosis of 50 to 70%, and Group 2 has more than 70%. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) was used to measure the retinal thickness (RT) and choroidal thickness (CT) in all subjects before surgery and at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery.Results: Subfoveal and parafoveal CT were significantly lower in patients with ICA stenosis than the control group (p &lt; .05, respectively). Patients with 50-70% stenosis had a significant increase in the CT at 1, 3, and 6 months after ICA stenting or endarterectomy (p &lt; .05). Patients with &gt;%70 stenosis did not have a significant increase in the CT at any time after ICA stenting or endarterectomy. Retinal thickness was not statistically different between the patients with ICA stenosis and the control subjects, and RT showed no significant change in patients with ICA stenosis before and after the surgery.Conclusion: Choroidal thickness was significantly thinner in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis. ICA stenting provided a recovery in the choroidal thickness in patients with moderate to advanced stenosis.
