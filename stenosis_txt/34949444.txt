Title: Major stoma related morbidity in young children following stoma formation and closure: A retrospective cohort study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Little is known about stoma related morbidity in young children. Therefore, the aim of this study is to assess major morbidity after stoma formation and stoma closure and its associated risk factors.
METHODS: All consecutive young children (age ≤ three years) who received a stoma between 1998 and 2018 at our tertiary referral center were retrospectively included. The incidence of major stoma related morbidity (Clavien-Dindo grade ≥III) was the primary outcome. This was separately analysed for stoma formation alone, stoma closure alone and all stoma interventions combined. Non-stoma related morbidity was excluded. Risk factors for major morbidity were identified using multivariable logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: In total 336 young children were included with a median follow-up of 6 (IQR:2-11) years. Of these young children, 5% (n = 17/336) received a jejunostomy, 57% (n = 192/336) an ileostomy, and 38% (n = 127/336) a colostomy. Following stoma formation, 27% (n = 92/336) of the young children experienced major stoma related morbidity, mainly consisting of high output stoma, prolapse and stoma stenosis. The major morbidity rate was 23% (n = 66/292) following stoma closure, most commonly comprising anastomotic leakage/stenosis, incisional hernia and adhesive obstructions. For combined stoma interventions, major stoma related morbidity was 39% (n = 130/336). Ileostomy was independently associated with a higher risk of developing major morbidity following stoma formation (OR:2.5; 95%-CI:1.3-4.7) as well as following closure (OR:2.7; 95%-CI:1.3-5.8).
CONCLUSIONS: Major stoma related morbidity is a frequent and severe clinical problem in young children, both after stoma formation and closure. The risk of morbidity should be considered when deliberating a stoma.
