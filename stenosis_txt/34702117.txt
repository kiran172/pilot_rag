Title: The effects of serum ischemia modified albumin on diagnosis of cerebral infarction and vertebral basilar artery stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Serum ischemia-modified albumin (IMA) is higher in patients with cerebral infarction (CI). In this study, we aimed at studying the association between IMA and CI.
METHODS: Patients with CI were divided to severe stenosis group and mild stenosis group according to the stenosis of vertebrobasilar artery. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for diagnosis. Cobalt-combined with Albumin test was used to determine the serum IMA levels. Serum IMA levels in patients with CI and healthy volunteers were compared by t test. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was performed for evaluating the diagnostic efficiency of serum IMA for CI. The correlation between IMA level and the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale(NIHSS) score after treatment was analyzed.
RESULTS: Serum IMA levels in patients with CI was increased compared to healthy volunteers(P &lt; .05). Patients in severe stenosis group had a higher serum IMA level than mild stenosis group(P &lt; .05). Serum IMA level at admission was associated with NIHSS score on the 7th day after treatment(P &lt; .05).
CONCLUSIONS: Serum IMA level was correlated with vertebrobasilar artery stenosis and  short-term prognosis in patients with acute CI.
