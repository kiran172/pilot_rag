Title: TAVI in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis and Coexisting Mitral Valve Regurgitation.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Severe aortic stenosis with coexisting mitral regurgitation (MR) of various severity is a common finding. The goal of our study was to evaluate the relation between transcatheter transfemoral aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on coexisting MR and compare the outcome in MR improvement and nonimprovement groups.
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 252 patients who underwent TAVI with associated at least moderate MR between January 2018 and December 2020. Effect of changes in MR grade at discharge and 6-12 mo follow-up were compared.
RESULTS: Echocardiography was performed at discharge in 245 patients and at follow-up in 154 patients. MR improvement was seen in 60.8% patients and nonimprovement in 39.2%. Overall survival was significantly higher in the MR improvement group (P = 0.020). There was a statistically significant effect on MR grade with a significant increase in the proportion of patients with mild MR at follow-up compared to discharge (58.4% versus 38.3%, P < 0.001). A similar positive effect was seen on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at follow-up compared to discharge (P < 0.001). LVEF in the MR improvement group was significantly higher at follow-up versus discharge (P < 0.001), but there was no statistically significant change in LVEF in the nonimprovement group at follow-up versus discharge (P < 0.722).
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI in severe aortic stenosis with coexisting significant mitral valve regurgitation decreases MR severity in more than 60% of patients and improved LVEF as well as mortality.
