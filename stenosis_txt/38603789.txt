Title: Differences in life expectancy within and between countries: implications for domestic TAVI guidelines in Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand.

Abstract: The advent of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has caused a paradigm shift in the management of aortic stenosis away from traditional surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR). However, uncertainty remains about the long-term (>10 year) durability of TAVI valves, especially in younger patients. This viewpoint collates life expectancy data from Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand to propose sex-specific age-based recommendations for choice of SAVR versus TAVI in their respective general populations and among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in Australia and both MƒÅori and Pacific peoples living in Aotearoa New Zealand.
