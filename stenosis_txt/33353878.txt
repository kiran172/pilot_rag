Title: [A Case Report of Subacute Thrombosis after Carotid Stenting Caused by Food Allergy].

Abstract: An 89-year-old man underwent carotid artery stenting for symptomatic left internal carotid artery stenosis. His postoperative course was uneventful;however, on postoperative day 4, he developed a food allergy rash throughout his body after consuming sushi. He developed right hemiplegia and aphasia the following day, and magnetic resonance imaging revealed left internal carotid artery occlusion. Angiography revealed stent thrombosis, and endovascular thrombectomy achieved partial recanalization;however, right hemiplegia and aphasia persisted. Eosinophilia and increased platelet aggregation suggested allergic stent thrombosis(Kounis syndrome type 3).
