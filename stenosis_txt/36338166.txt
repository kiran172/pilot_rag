Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of Diastolic Fractional Flow Reserve for Functional Evaluation of Coronary Stenosis: DIASTOLE Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the resting conditions, narrowing the window of coronary pressure measurements from the whole cardiac cycle to diastole improves diagnostic performance of coronary pressure-derived physiological index. However, whether this also applies to the hyperemic conditions has not yet been thoroughly evaluated.
OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess whether diastolic fractional flow reserve (diastolic FFR) has better diagnostic performance in identifying ischemia-causing coronary lesions than conventional FFR in a prospective, multicenter, and independent core laboratory-based environment.
METHODS: In this prospective multicenter registry at 29 Japanese centers, we compared the diagnostic performance of FFR, diastolic FFR, resting distal to aortic coronary pressure (Pd/Pa), and diastolic pressure ratio (dPR) using myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) as the reference standard in 378 patients with single-vessel coronary disease.
RESULTS: Inducible myocardial ischemia was found on MPS in the relevant myocardial territory of the target vessel in 85 patients (22%). In the receiver-operating curve analyses, diastolic FFR had comparable area under the curve (AUC) compared with FFR (AUC<sub>diastolic FFR</sub>: 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.58-0.73, vs AUC<sub>FFR</sub>: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.58-0.74, P = 0.624). FFR and diastolic FFR showed significantly larger AUCs than resting Pd/Pa (0.62; 95% CI: 0.54-0.70; P = 0.033 and P = 0.046) but did not show significantly larger AUCs than dPR (0.62; 95% CI: 0.55-0.70; P = 0.102 and P = 0.113).
CONCLUSIONS: Diastolic FFR showed a similar diagnostic performance to FFR as compared with MPS. This result reaffirms the use of FFR as the most accurate invasive physiological lesion assessment.
