Title: Comparison of SUV<sub>A</sub><sub>/V</sub> and SUV<sub>A</sub><sub>-V</sub> for Evaluating Atherosclerotic Inflammation in 18F-FDG PET/CT.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to compare the clinical significance of two parameters, division of standardized uptake value (SUV) of target arterial activity by background venous blood pool activity (SUV<sub>A/V</sub>) and subtraction of background venous blood pool activity from SUV of target arterial activity (SUV<sub>A-V</sub>) of carotid arteries with atherosclerotic plaques using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT).
METHODS: Patients aged 50 years or more who were diagnosed with carotid artery stenosis of 50% or more with carotid Doppler ultrasonography and had torso 18F-FDG PET/CT were enrolled retrospectively and classified patients who developed cerebrovascular events (CVEs) within 5 years after 18F-FDG PET/CT scan as the active group and patients who did not experience the CVE within 5 years as an inactive group. We calculated SUV<sub>A/V</sub> and SUV<sub>A-V</sub> using measurements of SUV<sub>max</sub> of carotid arteries and mean SUV of superior vena cava (SVC).
RESULTS: SUV<sub>A-V</sub>, SUV<sub>A-V_high</sub>, and SUV<sub>A-V_low</sub> were significantly higher in the active group than in the inactive group, but neither SUV<sub>A/V</sub>, SUV<sub>A/V_high</sub>, nor SUV<sub>A/V_low</sub> showed significant differences between the active and inactive groups. The difference in rank between groups of SUV<sub>A/V_high</sub> and SUV<sub>A/V_low</sub> was greater than the difference in rank between groups of SUV<sub>A-V_high</sub> and SUV<sub>A-V_low</sub>. The CVE incidence differed between SUV<sub>A/V_high</sub> and SUV<sub>A/V_low</sub> of high carotid FDG uptake, but the CVE incidence did not differ between SUV<sub>A-V_high</sub> and SUV<sub>A-V_low</sub> of high carotid FDG uptake.
CONCLUSION: SUV<sub>A-V</sub> may be a more rational solution than SUV<sub>A/V</sub> for evaluating atherosclerotic plaque inflammation on 18F-FDG PET/CT.
