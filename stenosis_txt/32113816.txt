Title: Durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation: A translational review.

Abstract: Until recently, transcatheter aortic valve implantation was restricted to high-risk and inoperable patients. The updated 2017 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines has widened the indication to include intermediate-risk patients, based on two recently published trials (PARTNER 2 and SURTAVI). Moreover, two other recent trials (PARTNER 3 and EVOLUT LOW RISK) have demonstrated similar results with transcatheter aortic valve implantation in low-risk patients. Thus, extension of transcatheter aortic valve implantation to younger patients, who are currently treated by surgical aortic valve replacement, raises the crucial question of bioprosthesis durability. In this translational review, we propose to produce a state-of-the-art overview of the durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation by integrating knowledge of the basic science of bioprosthesis degeneration (pathophysiology and biomarkers). After summarising the new definition of structural valve deterioration, we will present what is known about the pathophysiology of aortic stenosis and bioprosthesis degeneration. Next, we will consider how to identify a population at risk of early degeneration, and how basic science with the help of biomarkers could identify and predict structural valve deterioration. Finally, we will present data on the differences in durability of transcatheter aortic valve implantation compared with surgical aortic valve replacement.
