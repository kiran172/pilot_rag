Title: Comparison of 1-year Follow-up Echocardiographic Outcomes of Sapien 3 Versus Evolut R Bioprosthetic Transcatheter Aortic Valves: A Single-center Retrospective Iranian Cohort Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to compare 1-year echocardiographic outcomes of the new generations of self-expanding (Evolut R) versus balloon-expandable (Sapien 3) bioprosthetic transcatheter aortic valves.
METHODS: In this study, gradients and flow velocities obtained from transthoracic Doppler-echocardiography were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent 2 new generations of transcatheter aortic valve implantation interventions with Sapien 3 and Evolut R valves. Patients underwent echocardiography before the procedure and at discharge, 6 months, and 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: Of the 66 patients, 28 received Sapien 3 and 38 received Evolut R valves. Evolut R valve presented a lower mean gradient at all follow-up time points compared with Sapien 3 valves (14.4 mm Hg, 14.9 mm Hg, 15.5 mm Hg compared with 10.1 mm Hg, 11.6 mm Hg, 11.8 mm Hg, respectively; all P -values <0.001). Small valve sizes of Evolut R, including 23 and 26, had higher echocardiographic mean gradient or peak gradient at the time of discharge compared with larger valves, including sizes 29 and 34 (11.1 mm Hg and 11.2 mm Hg vs. 10.2 mm Hg, 9.1 mm Hg) and 1-year follow-up (11.0 mm Hg, 11.0 mm Hg vs. 9.9 mm Hg, 8.4 mm Hg; all P -values = 0.001). Although Sapien 3 valves demonstrated a higher peak gradient in smaller sizes at discharge (18.44 mm Hg in size 23 vs. 17.9 mm Hg, 16.5 mm Hg in size 26 and 29, respectively; P = 0.001), the peak gradients did not show a statistically significant difference in the 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study detected significantly lower mean and peak gradients in Evolut R compared with Sapien 3 at all follow-up time points. Furthermore, smaller valve sizes were associated with significantly higher gradients at all follow-ups, regardless of the valve type.
