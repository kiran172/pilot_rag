Title: Valve-Sparing Root Replacement Without Cusp Repair for Regurgitant Quadricuspid Aortic Valve.

Abstract: Quadricuspid aortic valve (QAV) is a relatively rare valve abnormality. Patients with aortic valve regurgitation or stenosis associated with congenital abnormalities often require surgery at a relatively young age. In most cases, patients with QAV undergo aortic valve replacement. We report on a 58-year-old patient with QAV and aortic insufficiency due to enlarged aortic root. Valve-sparing aortic root replacement was performed without any procedure on the aortic leaflets.
