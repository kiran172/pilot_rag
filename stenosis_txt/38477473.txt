Title: Diagnostic Efficacy of a Novel Rotating Brush for Endoscopic Sampling of Malignant Biliary Strictures: A Multicenter Prospective Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Although cytologic examination of biliary stricture brushings obtained by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is commonly used for diagnosing malignant biliary strictures (MBSs), it has low sensitivity. Several new brushes have capabilities that are still being debated. We have developed a novel brush working from conventional back-and-forth movement to rotation in situ (RIS) that may be more efficient for MBS sampling. We aimed to compare the MBS detection sensitivity of our RIS brush with that of the conventional brush.
METHODS: In this multicenter prospective study, we enrolled patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for suspected MBSs involving biliary stricture brushings obtained using our RIS brush. The historical control group consisted of the 30-brushing arm of our previous randomized trial (patient inclusion, 2018-2020) that used the study design in the same centers and with the same endoscopists as were used in this study. The primary outcome was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of detecting MBSs by cytologic evaluation of biliary stricture brushings between the 2 groups.
RESULTS: We enrolled 155 patients in the intent-to-treat analysis. Using the same number of brushing cycles, the RIS brush showed a higher sensitivity than the conventional brush (0.73 vs 0.56, P = 0.003). In per-protocol population, the sensitivity was also higher in the RIS brush group than in the conventional brush group (0.75 vs 0.57, P = 0.002). Multivariate analysis revealed that the RIS brush was the only predictive factor for MBS detection. No significant differences were observed in procedure-related complications between the 2 groups.
DISCUSSION: The RIS brush was a promising tool for effective and safe MBS sampling and diagnosis. Further randomized studies are warranted to confirm our results (Chictr.org.cn, identifier: ChiCTR2100047270).
