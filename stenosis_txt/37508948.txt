Title: Asymmetry of Lacunae between Brain Hemispheres Is Associated with Atherosclerotic Occlusions of Middle Cerebral Artery.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) commonly coexists with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Previous studies have tried to evaluate the relationship between ICAS and CSVD; however, they have yielded varied conclusions. Furthermore, the methodology of these studies is not very rigorous, as they have evaluated the association between ICAS and CSVD of bilateral hemispheres rather than the affected hemisphere. Unilateral middle cerebral artery atherosclerotic occlusion (uni-MCAO) is a favorable model to solve this problem.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with uni-MCAO were retrospectively observed. Imaging characteristics, including lacunae, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs), were compared between the hemisphere ipsilateral to the MCAO and the contralateral hemisphere.
RESULTS: A total of 219 patients (median age 57 years; 156 males) were enrolled. Compared with the contralateral side, increased quality of lacunae (median, IQR, 0, 2 vs. 0, 1; p &lt; 0.001) and elevated CSVD score (median, IQR, 0, 1 vs. 0, 1; p = 0.004) were found in the occluded hemisphere. No significant differences were shown for WMH, EPVS, and CMBs.
CONCLUSIONS: Uni-MCAO has a higher prevalence of lacunae in the ipsilateral hemisphere. However, no interhemispheric differences in WMH, EPVS, or CMBs were found.
