Title: Endoscopy management of sleeve gastrectomy stenosis: what we learned from 202 consecutive patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Gastric sleeve stenosis (GSS) is described in 1%-4% of patients.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of endoscopy in the management of stenosis after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy using a standardized approach according to the characteristic of stenosis.
SETTING: Retrospective, observational, single-center study on patients referred from several bariatric surgery departments to an endoscopic referral center.
METHODS: We enrolled 202 patients. All patients underwent endoscopy in a fluoroscopy setting, and a systematic classification of the type, site, and length of the GSS was performed. According to the characteristics of the stenosis, patients underwent pneumatic dilatation or placement of a self-expandable metal stent or a lumen-apposed metal stent. Failure of endoscopic treatment was considered an indication for redo surgery, whereas patients with partial or complete response were followed up for 2 years. In the event of a recurrence, a different endoscopic approach was used.
RESULTS: We found inflammatory strictures in 4.5% of patients, pure narrowing in 11%, and functional stenosis in 84.5%. Stenosis was in the upper tract of the stomach in 53 patients, whereas medium and distal stenosis was detected in 138 and 11 patients, respectively, and short stenosis in 194 patients. A total of 126 patients underwent pneumatic dilatation, 8 self-expandable metal stent placement, 64 lumen-apposed metal stent positioning, and 36 combined therapy. The overall rate of endoscopy success was 69%.
CONCLUSION: GSS should be considered to be a chronic disease, and the endoscopic approach seems to be the most successful treatment, with a prolonged positive outcome of 69%. Characteristics of the stenosis should guide the most suitable endoscopic approach.
