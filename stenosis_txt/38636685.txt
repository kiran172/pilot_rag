Title: Hemodynamic Comparison of the On-X and Top Hat Mechanical Aortic Valve Prostheses.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There are limited data comparing hemodynamic valve function in mechanical aortic valve prostheses. This study compared the hemodynamic function of 2 commonly used mechanical aortic valve (AV) prostheses, the On-X (Artivion) and Top Hat (CarboMedics Inc) valves.
METHODS: This study was a retrospective analysis of 512 patients who underwent AV replacement with the On-X (n = 252; 49%) or Top Hat (n = 260; 51%) mechanical valves between 2011 and 2019. Patients were matched on the basis of selected variables. Echocardiographic data were collected preoperatively and postoperatively over a median follow-up of 1.39 years.
RESULTS: A total of 320 patients were matched, 160 patients in each group. Despite being matched for left ventricular outflow tract diameter, patients in the Top Hat group received a greater prevalence of smaller tissue annulus diameter valves (≤21 mm) (83% vs 38%; P &lt; .001). Patients in the On-X group had longer aortic cross-clamp times (78 minutes vs 64 minutes; P &lt; .001) during isolated aortic valve replacement. Discharge echocardiography showed no difference in the AV area index between both groups (1.00 cm2/m2 vs 1.02 cm2/m2; P = .377). During longer-term echocardiographic follow-up, the AV area index remained stable for both valves within their respective tissue annulus diameter groups (P = .060).
CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference between the 2 valves with respect to the AV area index at discharge, and hemodynamic function was stable during longer-term follow-up. The longer aortic cross-clamp time observed in the On-X group may indicate increased complexity of implantation compared with the Top Hat group.
