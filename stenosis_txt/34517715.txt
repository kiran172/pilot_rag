Title: Risk factors of refractory post-endoscopic submucosal dissection esophageal strictures.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: our aim was to comparatively assess the treatment outcomes of endoscopic dilatation in Barrett's neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) post-endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) strictures, and to determine the risk or factors associated to refractory strictures.
METHODS: an observational study. All consecutive patients presenting with a post-ESD stricture in 2007-2016 who underwent dilation therapy were included. Clinical, morphological, and technical features were assessed to determine the risk factors of refractory strictures.
RESULTS: of 414 consecutive patients treated by ESD, 83 (mean age: 65 ± 10 years, 76 % men) with 254 dilations (median: 3, range: 1-27) were considered. Barrett's neoplasia and SCC were the indications in 58 (69.9 %) and in 25 (30.1 %) cases, respectively. Clinical success was achieved in 84.3 % with a median of 3 sessions (range: 1-22), with a higher rate in Barrett's neoplasia (89.7 % vs. 72 %, p = 0.042). Circumferential resection in one single procedure (13.2 %) was associated with the need for a higher number of dilation sessions. By multivariate analysis, upper-esophageal location (OR: 11.479 [95 % CI: 2.058-64.043], p = 0.005), recurrent strictures (OR: 17.252 [95 % CI: 2.833-105.069], p = 0.002), and dilation-related complications (OR: 26.420 [95 % CI: 1.736-401.966], p = 0.018) were risk factors of refractory stenosis.
CONCLUSION: patients presenting with SCC located in the upper superior esophagus, intra-procedural perforation, and recurrent strictures are at higher risk of developing refractory strictures.
