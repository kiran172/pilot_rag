Title: Combined Echo and Fluoroscopy-Guided Pulmonary Valvuloplasty in Neonates and Infants: Efficacy and Safety.

Abstract: Percutaneous balloon pulmonary valvuloplasty (PBPV) is the treatment of choice for isolated pulmonary valve stenosis. While this procedure is highly efficacious and has an excellent safety profile, as currently practiced, patients are obligatorily exposed to the secondary risks of ionizing radiation and contrast media. To mitigate these risks, we developed a protocol which utilized echo guidance for portions of the procedure which typically require fluoroscopy and/or angiography. Ten cases of echo-guided pulmonary valvuloplasty (EG-PBPV) for isolated pulmonary stenosis in children less than a year of age were compared to a historical cohort of nineteen standard cases using fluoroscopy/angiography alone, which demonstrated equivalent procedural outcomes and safety, while achieving a median reduction in radiation (total dose area product) and contrast load of 80% and 84%, respectively. Our early experience demonstrates that EG-PBPV in neonates and infants has results equivalent to standard valvuloplasty but with less radiation and contrast.
