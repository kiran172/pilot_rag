Title: Decision-Making in the Treatment of Idiopathic Subglottic Stenosis: A Survey of Laryngologists.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Idiopathic subglottic stenosis (iSGS) is a rare condition involving the subglottic larynx and upper trachea, commonly affecting Caucasian females between 30 and 50 years of age. Despite its homogeneous presentation, clinical management for iSGS is yet to be standardized, leading to variability in outcomes between predominant interventions. In recognition of the heterogenicity in iSGS treatment and the need to improve patient outcomes, this study aimed to survey laryngologists to understand the factors influencing clinical decision-making and the incorporation of new treatment modalities for iSGS.
METHODS: An online survey was sent to 145 academic laryngologists. The survey assessed respondents' professional backgrounds, experience treating iSGS, treatment algorithms, and how various patient factors affect management.
RESULTS: Of the 87 (60%) laryngologists who responded to the survey, the most common clinical assessments were tracheoscopy/bronchoscopy (96.8%) and pulmonary function tests (43.6%). Endoscopic dilation (ED) was the most common primary treatment offered (97.5%): 28.7% of surveyed laryngologists offer SISI as a primary treatment, and 74.7% perform SISI as a planned postoperative treatment. The most common SISI protocol was repeated injections every 4-6 weeks for a series of 1-3 total injections. Notably, 9.2% perform the Maddern procedure. Routine algorithms of care involving surgery were most often based on prior experience and prior patient outcomes (75.9%) and conversations with colleagues (64.4%). Only 31% report using the same protocol learned during their fellowship training.
CONCLUSION: This survey highlights significant variation in the management of patients with iSGS. Understanding the factors that influence decision-making may lead to potential standardization in heterogeneous treatment approaches and may improve clinical outcomes.
