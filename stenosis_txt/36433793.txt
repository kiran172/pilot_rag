Title: Radiation-Induced Laryngeal Mucous Membrane Pemphigoid.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Bullous pemphigoid has previously been linked to radiotherapy, but here we report the first case of MMP suspected to be a consequence of RT.
METHODS: The patient described is an 85-year-old male who underwent RT to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the palatine tonsil. Shortly after therapy, the patient developed blisters with worsening dyspnea and dysphonia.
RESULTS: This patient was successfully treated with a combination of oral immunosuppressants and surgical intervention.
CONCLUSION: This incident underscores that not all episodes of mucosal ulceration following radiation are a result of mucositis and MMP should be considered in the differential.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4.
