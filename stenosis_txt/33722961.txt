Title: Pivotal trial of the Neuroform Atlas stent for treatment of posterior circulation aneurysms: one-year outcomes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stent-assisted coiling of wide-necked intracranial aneurysms (IAs) using the Neuroform Atlas Stent System (Atlas) has shown promising results.
OBJECTIVE: To present the primary efficacy and safety results of the ATLAS Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trial in a cohort of patients with posterior circulation IAs.
METHODS: The ATLAS trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of unruptured, wide-necked, IAs treated with the Atlas stent and adjunctive coiling. This study reports the results of patients with posterior circulation IAs. The primary efficacy endpoint was complete aneurysm occlusion (Raymond-Roy (RR) class I) on 12-month angiography, in the absence of re-treatment or parent artery stenosis >50%. The primary safety endpoint was any major ipsilateral stroke or neurological death within 12 months. Adjudication of the primary endpoints was performed by an imaging core laboratory and a Clinical Events Committee.
RESULTS: The ATLAS trial enrolled and treated 116 patients at 25 medical centers with unruptured, wide-necked, posterior circulation IAs (mean age 60.2Â±10.5 years, 81.0% (94/116) female). Stents were placed in all patients with 100% technical success rate. A total of 95/116 (81.9%) patients had complete angiographic follow-up at 12 months, of whom 81 (85.3%) had complete aneurysm occlusion (RR class I). The primary effectiveness outcome was achieved in 76.7% (95% CI 67.0% to 86.5%) of patients. Overall, major ipsilateral stroke and secondary persistent neurological deficit occurred in 4.3% (5/116) and 1.7% (2/116) of patients, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the ATLAS IDE posterior circulation cohort, the Neuroform Atlas Stent System with adjunctive coiling demonstrated high rates of technical and safety performance. Trial registration number https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02340585.
