Title: [Status and Future Directions of Diagnostic Techniques Related to Bile Duct Stenosis].

Abstract: The diagnosis and differential diagnosis of bile duct stenosis are the foundation for personalized treatment. However, accurate diagnosis of bile duct stenosis remains a significant challenge in the era of precise medicine. In recent years, several novel diagnostic techniques of bile duct stenosis have been developed. And various biomarker detection, non-invasive imaging diagnostic techniques and invasive endoscopic diagnostic techniques have gradually become the conventional techniques for diagnosing bile duct stenosis. Here, we systematically reviewed the current status and future directions of diagnostic techniques related to bile duct stenosis.
