Title: Enhanced arrhythmogenic potential induced by renal autonomic nerve stimulation: Role of renal artery catheter ablation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Renal artery catheter ablation has been reported as a possible therapeutic option for drug-refractory ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) associated with structural heart diseases.
OBJECTIVE: To further clarify its therapeutic background, we examined the relationship between electrical nerve stimulation (ENS)-induced blood pressure (BP) elevation and occurrence of VAs by using an acute canine model of renal artery ablation.
METHODS: Using a decapolar electrode catheter, ENS was successively applied from the distal, mid, and proximal segments of the renal artery in 8 beagles. The same ENS was repeated after accomplishment of radiofrequency ablation at the ostial site of the renal artery by using an irrigation catheter.
RESULTS: Before ablation, ENS increased BP from 140 ± 11/77 ± 11 to 167 ± 20/98 ± 16 mm Hg and heart rate from 100 ± 21 to 131±33 beats/min as well as induced VAs in 20 of the 45 ENS applications. Occurrence of VAs was associated with a greater magnitude of sympathetic nerve augmentation, and VAs were more frequently observed by ENS at the distal (67%) rather than mid/proximal segments of the renal artery (33%). Renal artery ablation was accomplished without any angiographic stenosis, and ENS-induced BP elevation, heart rate acceleration, and VAs occurrence were attenuated not only at the close segment (proximal) but also at the remote segments (mid/distal) of the renal artery.
CONCLUSION: The renal autonomic nerves are considered as one of the therapeutic targets for suppression of frequent VAs because its activation has arrhythmogenic potential and induces premature ventricular beats.
