Title: Mechanical Jaundice and Bile Duct Stricture Caused by the Migration of Endoclip and Silk Suture Material into the Common Bile Duct.

Abstract: It is quite rare the migration of metal clips and silk suture materials into the common bile duct (CBD) that were used for the closure of cystic duct in conventional or laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The most common cause of postoperative jaundice is unrecognised or overlooked stones in the bile ducts during operation. The authors present four patients who developed jaundice and in one case  biliary tract stricture,  caused by the migration of metal clip and silk suture material into CBD  following conventional and laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The migration of endoclip and suture material in to CBD is very rare and it should be kept in mind in post-cholecystectomy jaundice. Key Words: Cholecystectomy, Endoclip migration, Mechanical jaundice, Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography.
