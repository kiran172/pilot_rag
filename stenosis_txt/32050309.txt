Title: Evaluating Spinal Canal Lesions Using Apparent Diffusion Coefficient Maps with Diffusion-Weighted Imaging.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Observational study.
PURPOSE: To evaluate healthy volunteers and patients with spinal canal lesions using apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps with diffusion-weighted imaging.
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Decompression surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is selected on the basis of subjective assessment and cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, there is no objective standard for this procedure.
METHODS: We performed 3T MRI in 10 healthy volunteers and 13 patients with LSS. The ADC values in the spinal canal were evaluated at 46 vertebrae (L4/5 and L5/S1 for each participant), and the reduced and conventional fields of view were compared.
RESULTS: The ADC values were 2.72±0.12 at L4/5 in healthy volunteers, 2.76±0.19 at L5/S1 in healthy volunteers, 1.77±0.58 at L4/5 in patients with LSS, and 2.35±0.29 at L5/S1 in patients with LSS. The ADC value at L4/5 in patients with LSS was significantly lower than that at L5/S1 in patients with LSS and that at L4/5 and L5/S1 in healthy volunteers (p <0.05). With an ADC cutoff value of 2.46 to identify LSS, this approach provided an area under the curve of 0.81, sensitivity of 0.92, and specificity of 0.76 (p <0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Preoperative examination using ADC maps permits visualization and quantification of spinal canal lesions, thus proving the utility of ADC maps in the selection of decompression surgery for LSS.
