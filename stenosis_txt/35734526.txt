Title: Single Ventricle and Valve-in-Valve, An Impediment or a New Horizon for TAVR?

Abstract: We present a case of a 30-year-old patient with Fontan physiology and prior bioprosthetic valve replacement who developed severe bioprosthetic aortic valve stenosis. We describe the challenges and planning involved to successfully perform a transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve procedure in this especially complex subset of patients. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
