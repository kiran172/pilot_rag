Title: [The endoscopic approach to indeterminate biliary stricture: current practice and future perspective].

Abstract: Patients with indeterminate biliary stricture frequently pose a challenge in the clinical management. Patients with malignant and potentially resectable diseases should be treated surgically as soon as possible. On the other hand, in patients with benign diseases which might be cured with medial treatment, surgery should be avoided. This review shall provide a concise overview on the diagnostic yield of currently available endoscopic methods as well as describe methods of potential relevance in the future.
