Title: Hybrid Interventions for Pulmonary Vein Stenosis: Leveraging Intraoperative Endovascular Adjuncts in Challenging Clinical Scenarios.

Abstract: Background: Pediatric pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is often progressive and treatment-refractory, requiring multiple interventions. Hybrid pulmonary vein interventions (HPVIs), involving intraoperative balloon angioplasty or stent placement, leverage surgical access and customization to optimize patency while facilitating future transcatheter procedures. We review our experience with HPVI and explore potential applications of this collaborative approach. Methods: Retrospective chart review of all HPVI cases between 2009 to 2023. Results: Ten patients with primary (n = 5) or post-repair (n = 5) PVS underwent HPVI at median age of 12.7 months (range 6.6 months-9.5 years). Concurrent surgical PVS repair was performed in 7/10 cases. Hybrid pulmonary vein intervention was performed on 17 veins, 13 (76%) with prior surgical or transcatheter intervention(s). One patient underwent intraoperative balloon angioplasty of an existing stent. In total, 18 stents (9 bare metal [5-10 mm diameter], 9 drug eluting [3.5-5 mm diameter]) were placed in 16 veins. At first angiography (median 48 days [range 7 days-2.8 years] postoperatively), 8 of 16 (50%) HPVI-stented veins developed in-stent stenosis. Two patients died from progressive PVS early in the study, one prior to planned reintervention. Median time to first pulmonary vein reintervention was 86 days (10 days-2.8 years; 8/10 patients, 13/17 veins). At median survivor follow-up of 2.2 years (2.3 months-13.1 years), 1 of 11 surviving HPVI veins were completely occluded. Conclusions: Hybrid pulmonary vein intervention represents a viable adjunct to existing PVS therapies, with promising flexibility to address limitations of surgical and transcatheter modalities. Reintervention is anticipated, necessitating evaluation of long-term benefits and durability as utilization increases.
