Title: Iatrogenic Tricuspid Regurgitation Associated With Pacemakers: A Case Compounded by Tricuspid Stenosis.

Abstract: A patient presented with severe tricuspid regurgitation 20 years after dual-chamber pacing. Transesophageal echocardiography suggested ventricular pacing wire adherence to the tricuspid valve (TV) and atrial wire prolapse across the tricuspid annulus. Surgical extraction of the pacing wires revealed TV commissural fusion and subvalvular thickening causing tricuspid stenosis, requiring TV replacement. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
