Title: A Case of Pontine Infarction due to Subclavian Steal Phenomenon Enhanced by an Arteriovenous Shunt for Hemodialysis.

Abstract: We present a case of pontine infarction caused by subclavian steal phenomenon (SSP) due to subclavian artery stenosis (SAS) and an arteriovenous shunt in the forearm in a 74-year-old man with hemodialysis and stenting for SAS with improvement of SSP. He developed dysarthria during dialysis. He was admitted to our hospital and diagnosed with a pontine infarction. As the basilar artery appeared to be occluded on magnetic resonance angiography, an emergency diagnostic angiography was performed. Aortagram showed severe stenosis of the left subclavian artery. Right vertebral artery (VA) angiogram revealed retrograde arterial blood flow from the right VA to the left VA via the VA union, which suggested SSP. In addition, the steal was augmented by an ipsilateral hemodialysis arteriovenous shunt. Percutaneous subclavian artery stenting was performed 12 days later, and there was no recurrence of symptoms in the follow-up period. To our knowledge, this study is the first to report a patient with SSP who developed a pontine infarction due to SAS and an arteriovenous shunt during hemodialysis and who underwent subclavian artery stenting and had a good outcome.
