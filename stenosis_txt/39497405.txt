Title: [Efficacy of domestic single-hole robotic surgery system in the treatment of pediatric urological diseases].

Abstract: To explore the efficacy of domestic single-hole robotic surgery system in the treatment of pediatric urological diseases. A prospective review of clinical data of children who underwent laparoscopic surgery in the Department of Urology, Shanghai Children's Medical Center, School of Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, was conducted from July to November 2023. All surgeries were performed using the sharp single-port serpentine arm robotic surgery system, with an umbilical access route. All surgeries are performed by the same chief physician. Operative time, intraoperative blood loss, incision size, and postoperative complications were recorded. A total of 12 patients were included, consisting of 8 males and 4 females, aged 8.0-17.0 (13.5±2.7) years. The procedures included 5 pyeloplasties (1 case of bilateral pyeloplasty), with a unilateral operative time [M (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>) ]of 180 (145, 200) minutes and a blood loss of 5 (5, 10) ml. Oral mucosa ureteroplasty was performed in 1 patient, taking 3 hours and 52 minutes with a blood loss of 10 ml. Renal cyst decortication was conducted in 1 case in 85 minutes with a blood loss of 20 ml. High ligation of the spermatic vein was conducted in 3 patients, with an average operative time of 97 minutes and no intraoperative blood loss. Bilateral gonadectomy was completed in 80 minutes with a blood loss of 5 ml. Ovarian cystectomy (1 case) was performed in 69 minutes with a blood loss of 5 ml. All surgeries were successfully completed without conversion to open surgery. Except for the oral mucosa ureteroplasty, which required an additional 5 mm auxiliary port, all procedures were performed through a 3 cm umbilical incision. Among the patients who underwent pyeloplasty, 1 case of urinary leak was identified and successfully treated conservatively with adequate drainage over 25 days. Re-stenosis was experienced by 1 patient with a long segment ureteral stricture postoperatively, while no Clavien-Dindo grade≥2 complications were observed in other patients. All umbilical wounds were concealed, and satisfactory postoperative appearances were noted. The domestic single-hole robotic surgery system is effective in treating pediatric urological diseases.
