Title: Sialendoscopy-assisted transoral approach for parotid gland lithiasis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Although lithiasis represents more than 60% of all cases of salivary gland obstruction, only 20% occurs in the Stensen´s duct. Nonetheless, the potential complications related to parotid gland surgery due to facial nerve injury, makes the development of minimally invasive techniques highly relevant.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A pilot study was conducted to assess results of patients treated by sialendoscopy-assisted trans-oral approach to treat Stensen´s duct lithiasis.
RESULTS: Eight patients were included; all of them operated satisfactorily. Six of them were male, and 2 were female. The mean size of the stones was 9.6 mm (Min: 6 mm/Max: 16 mm). Regarding to lithiasis location: it was anterior to the masseter line in the distal third of the Stensen's duct in seven patients and in another patient was immediately below the buccinator muscle. During the follow-up, all patients presented a healthy functioning of the gland after the compressive massage. Regarding complications, one patient presented a Stensen's duct stenosis, which required reintervention.
CONCLUSION: The transoral Stensen´s duct approach represents a safe technique for lithiasis bigger than 3 mm in the distal portion of the Stensen´s duct, anterior to the Masseter Muscle line and when other minimal invasive techniques fail.
