Title: Complex Refractory Esophageal Stricture Due to Chronic Gasoline Ingestion: A Case Report.

Abstract: Esophageal stricture is a narrowing of the esophageal lumen which is often characterized by impaired swallowing or dysphagia. It can be induced by inflammation, fibrosis or neoplasia which damages the mucosa and/or submucosa of the esophagus. Corrosive substance ingestion is one of the major causes of esophageal stricture, particularly in children and young adults. For instance, accidental ingestion or attempted suicide with corrosive household products is not uncommon. Gasoline is a liquid mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons derived from the fractional distillation of petroleum, which is then combined with additives such as isooctane and aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene and benzene). Gasoline also contains several other additives including ethanol, methanol and formaldehyde, which make it a corrosive agent. Interestingly, to the best of our knowledge, the incidence of esophageal stricture caused by chronic gasoline ingestion has not been reported. In this paper, we report the case of a patient with dysphagia due to complex esophageal stricture due to chronic gasoline ingestion who underwent a series of esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) procedures and repeated esophageal dilation.
