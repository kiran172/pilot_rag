Title: Nucleotide ecto-enzyme metabolic pattern and spatial distribution in calcific aortic valve disease; its relation to pathological changes and clinical presentation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Extracellular nucleotide metabolism contributes to chronic inflammation, cell differentiation, and tissue mineralization by controlling nucleotide and adenosine concentrations and hence its purinergic effects. This study investigated location-specific changes of extracellular nucleotide metabolism in aortic valves of patients with calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Individual ecto-enzymes and adenosine receptors involved were analyzed together with correlation with CAVD severity and risk factors.
RESULTS: Nucleotide and adenosine degradation rates were adversely modified on the aortic surface of stenotic valve as compared to ventricular side, including decreased ATP removal (1.25 ± 0.35 vs. 2.24 ± 0.61 nmol/min/cm2) and adenosine production (1.32 ± 0.12 vs. 2.49 ± 0.28 nmol/min/cm2) as well as increased adenosine deamination (1.28 ± 0.31 vs. 0.67 ± 0.11 nmol/min/cm2). The rates of nucleotide to adenosine conversions were lower, while adenosine deamination was higher on the aortic sides of stenotic vs. non-stenotic valve. There were no differences in extracellular nucleotide metabolism between aortic and ventricular sides of non-stenotic valves. Furthermore, nucleotide degradation rates, measured on aortic side in CAVD (n = 62), negatively correlated with echocardiographic and biochemical parameters of disease severity (aortic jet velocity vs. ATP hydrolysis: r = - 0.30, p &lt; 0.05; vs. AMP hydrolysis: r = - 0.44, p &lt; 0.001; valvular phosphate concentration vs. ATP hydrolysis: r = - 0.26, p &lt; 0.05; vs. AMP hydrolysis: r = - 0.25, p = 0.05) while adenosine deamination showed positive correlation trend with valvular phosphate deposits (r = 0.23, p = 0.07). Nucleotide and adenosine conversion rates also correlated with CAVD risk factors, including hyperlipidemia (AMP hydrolysis vs. serum LDL cholesterol: r = - 0.28, p = 0.05; adenosine deamination vs. total cholesterol: r = 0.25, p = 0.05; LDL cholesterol: r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.05; triglycerides: r = 0.32, p &lt; 0.05), hypertension (adenosine deamination vs. systolic blood pressure: r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.05) and thrombosis (ATP hydrolysis vs. prothrombin time: r = - 0.35, p &lt; 0.01). Functional assays as well as histological and immunofluorescence, flow cytometry and RT-PCR studies identified all major ecto-enzymes engaged in nucleotide metabolism in aortic valves that included ecto-nucleotidases, alkaline phosphatase, and ecto-adenosine deaminase. We have shown that changes in nucleotide-converting ecto-enzymes were derived from their altered activities on valve cells and immune cell infiltrate. We have also demonstrated a presence of A1, A2a and A2b adenosine receptors with diminished expression of A2a and A2b in stenotic vs. non-stenotic valves. Finally, we revealed that augmenting adenosine effects by blocking adenosine deamination with deoxycoformycin decreased aortic valve thickness and reduced markers of calcification via adenosine-dependent pathways in a mouse model of CAVD.
CONCLUSIONS: This work highlights profound changes in extracellular nucleotide and adenosine metabolism in CAVD. Altered extracellular nucleotide hydrolysis and degradation of adenosine in stenotic valves may affect purinergic responses to support a pro-stenotic milieu and valve calcification. This emphasizes a potential mechanism and target for prevention and therapy. .
