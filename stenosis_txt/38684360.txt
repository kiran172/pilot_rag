Title: Bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis: the role of cardiac CT in diagnosis and guiding the management.

Abstract: A patient in his 60s with a bioprosthetic aortic and mitral valve replacement presented with dyspnoea, tiredness and dizziness 2 years postoperatively. Transthoracic echocardiography showed mitral valve stenosis and increased pulmonary artery pressure suggesting bioprosthetic valve failure. Cardiac CT confirmed the diagnosis of bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis. Treatment with anticoagulation resulted in a remarkable improvement of the valve area and gradient and complete resolution of the thrombus. Herein, we report a case of rare bioprosthetic mitral valve thrombosis.
