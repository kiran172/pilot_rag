Title: Superficial Femoral Artery in-Stent Restenosis Treated with Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon Angioplasty - Results of Three-Year Follow-Up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In-stent restenosis remains a common and important complication after endovascular treatment of superficial femoral artery peripheral artery disease. It occurs in 14 to 35% of cases in 1 year and there is still no efficient treatment for this condition. Paclitaxel-coated balloons have shown promising results.
OBJECTIVE: Investigate the 3 year results of superficial femoral artery in-stent restenosis treated with paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty, using the Lutonix™ 035 device.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective observational study with patients with symptomatic (Rutherford 2 to 5) superficial femoral artery in-stent restenosis, that were treated with paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty using the Lutonix™ 035 device, in a single center from January 2016 to December 2020. Duplex scan was used to follow the patients. Primary patency was obtained through Kaplan-Meier analysis. Mortality, and amputation rates were also evaluated.
RESULTS: 105 patients were included. Two patients had technical failure and required an additional stent, and were thus excluded. 103 patients were analyzed. Primary patency was 91.26, 80.47, and 67.71%, respectively, in the first, second, and third year after the procedure. There were no deaths 30 days after the procedure. There were no major amputations during the 3 year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Paclitaxel-coated balloon angioplasty with the Lutonix™ 035 device was a safe and effective treatment to superficial femoral artery in-stent restenoses. The results were maintained along the 3 year follow-up.
