Title: Surgical treatment for tracheal stent prolapse in a patient with blunt tracheal trauma.

Abstract: Blunt tracheal injury is a rare but life-threatening condition. Several indications for treatment have been reported. Conservative treatment (i.e., stenting) can be performed when the patient is clinically stable or has medical contraindications to surgical treatment. Although some studies have reported the use of tracheal stents as treatment for iatrogenic injury and blunt trauma, the efficacy of these stents is unknown. Herein, we report a case of emergency tracheoplasty for the management of tracheal stent prolapse in a patient with blunt tracheobronchial trauma. This report highlights the necessity of being cautious about the migration and prolapse of tracheal stents, which can more frequently occur in blunt trauma than in malignant stenosis or iatrogenic injury. Due to the limitations of non-surgical treatments, early surgical intervention may be lifesaving.
