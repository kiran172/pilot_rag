Title: Coronary disease in refractory cardiac arrest undergoing resuscitation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Abstract: AIMS: Because re-establishment of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) in patients with cardiac arrest is frequently not achieved by conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation (C-CPR), selected patients may undergo resuscitation with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (E-CPR). We compared angiographic features and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) between patients undergoing E-CPR and those with ROSC after C-CPR.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-nine consecutive E-CPR patients undergoing immediate coronary angiography admitted between August 2013 and August 2022 were matched to 49 patients with ROSC after C-CPR. Multivessel disease (69.4% vs. 34.7%; P = 0.001), ≥ 50% unprotected left main (ULM) stenosis (18.4% vs. 4.1%; P = 0.025), and ≥1 chronic total occlusion (CTO) (28.6% vs. 10.2%; P = 0.021) were more often documented in E-CPR group. There was no significant differences in the incidence, features, and distribution of acute culprit lesion which was present in >90%. Synergy between Percutaneous Coronary Intervention with Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) (27.6 vs. 13.4; P = 0.002) and GENSINI (86.2 vs. 46.0; P = 0.001) scores were increased in E-CPR group. Optimal cut-off predicting E-CPR was 19.75 for SYNTAX (sensitivity 74%, specificity 87%) and 60.50 (sensitivity 69%, specificity 75%) for GENSINI score. More lesions were treated (1.3 vs. 1.1 lesions/patient; P = 0.002) and stents implanted (2.0 vs. 1.3/patient; P < 0.001) in E-CPR group. Final TIMI three flow was comparable (88.6% vs. 95.7%; P = 0.196) but residual SYNTAX (13.6 vs. 3.1; P < 0.001) and GENSINI (36.7 vs. 10.9; P < 0.001) scores remained increased in E-CPR group.
CONCLUSION: Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients have more multivessel disease, ULM stenosis, and CTO but similar incidence, features, and distribution of acute culprit lesion. Despite more complex PCI, revascularization is less complete.
