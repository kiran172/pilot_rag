Title: Rates and Independent Correlates of 10-Year Major Adverse Events and Mortality in Patients Undergoing Left Main Coronary Arterial Revascularization.

Abstract: Patients who underwent myocardial revascularization for significant left main coronary artery disease (LMCA) are at high risks of ischemic events and death during follow-up. We sought to determine the independent correlates for very long-term outcomes after LMCA revascularization, which would be clinical value for risk stratification in such high-risk patients. The 10-year rates of clinical outcomes and independent correlates of adverse events were evaluated in 2,240 patients with LMCA disease in the MAIN-COMPARE registry, including 1,102 patients who underwent stenting and 1,138 who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting. The primary outcome was the composite of all-cause death, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or stroke. Secondary outcomes were all-cause mortality and target-vessel revascularization (TVR). The 10-year rates of the primary composite outcome, all-cause mortality, and TVR were 24.7%, 22.2%, and 13.6%, respectively. Age >65 years, diabetes, previous heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, chronic renal failure, atrial fibrillation, ejection fraction <40%, and distal LMCA bifurcation disease were independent correlates of the primary outcome in the overall population. Several clinical and anatomic parameters were also identified as independent correlates of all-cause death and TVR. Interaction analysis showed no heterogeneities of the effects of variables depending on revascularization type. These clinical descriptors can assist clinicians in identifying high-risk patients within the broad range of risk for patients who underwent LMCA revascularization.
