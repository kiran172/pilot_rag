Title: Electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses in deaf children with cochlear nerve canal stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Deaf children with cochlear nerve canal stenosis (CNCs) are always considered poor candidates for cochlear implantation.
OBJECTIVES: To investigate the function of the peripheral auditory pathway in deaf children with CNCs, as revealed by the electrically evoked auditory brainstem response (EABR), and postoperative cochlear implants (CIs) outcomes.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen children with CNCs and 13 children with no inner ear malformations (IEMs) who received CIs were recruited. The EABR evoked by electrical stimulation from the CI electrode was recorded. Postoperative CI outcomes were assessed using Categories of Auditory Performance (CAP) and Speech Intelligibility Rate (SIR).
RESULTS: Compared with children with no IEMs, children with CNCs showed lower EABR extraction rates, higher thresholds, a longer wave V (eV) latency and lower CAP and SIR scores. The auditory and speech performance was positively correlated with the diameter of the cochlear nerve canal and the number of channels showing wave III (eIII) and eV in children with CNCs.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: The physiological function of the peripheral auditory pathway in children with CNCs is poorer than that in children with no IEMs. Postoperative auditory and speech abilities may depend on the severity of cochlear nerve malformation and auditory conduction function.
