Title: Overview of Epiphora Referred to Oculoplastic Surgery Clinic in Adults.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to evaluate etiological and demographic characteristics of the adult patients referred to the oculoplastic surgery clinic of the tertiary care center with the complaint of epiphora.
METHODS: The medical records of the patients who applied to the oculoplastic surgery clinic with a complaint of epiphora between January 2014 and July 2021 were reviewed retrospectively. Etiology of epiphora, age, gender, duration of symptom, and follow-up period were evaluated. According to the etiological factors, nasolacrimal system disorders such as punctal stenosis, canalicular stenosis, canaliculitis, and acquired nasolacrimal system obstruction, respectively; the causes of epiphora were grouped as eyelid abnormalities such as entropion and ectropion, and hypersecretory tear secretion due to causes such as dry eye, allergy, and inflammation. The patients with epiphora over the age of 18 with at least 6 months of follow-up were included in the study. Patients with congenital or tumor-related nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) and epiphora due to trauma-related eyelid or canaliculi injury were not included.
RESULTS: A total of 595 medical fields were evaluated. Epiphora was present in 747 eyes of 595 patients. Of the patients, 221 (37%) were male and 376 (63%) were female. According to etiological evaluation of frequency, 372 (62.5%, 432 eyes) patients with NLDO, 63 (10.5%, 123 eyes) patients with punctal stenosis, 44 (7.3%) patients with ectropion, 38 (6.3%) patients with entropion, 37 (6.2%, 69 eyes) patients hypersecretory causes (dry eye, allergy, inflammation, etc.), 24 (4%) patients had primary canaliculitis, and 17 (2.8%) patients had epiphora due to canalicular occlusion.
CONCLUSION: Epiphora is an important complaint that may occur due to different etiologies. A detailed examination of the anterior segment, lacrimal system and eyelids, and taking a history are the most important steps in the management of the patient.
