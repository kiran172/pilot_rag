Title: [Posterior Surgical Techniques for Cervical Spine].

Abstract: Currently, various posterior surgical techniques are available for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. These techniques include laminoplasty and laminectomy with or without fusion, and are often used in patients with multilevel cervical stenosis. They were developed with the intent to reduce the risk of complications such as injury to the spinal cord and nerve roots, C5 palsy, postlaminectomy membrane, and postoperative kyphosis. Posterior decompression for cervical spondylotic myelopathy is effective in improving neurological function in patients with appropriate surgical indications.
