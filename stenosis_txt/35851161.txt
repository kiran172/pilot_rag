Title: Propranolol treatment of infantile subglottic hemangioma: a report of two cases and a literature review.

Abstract: Infantile hemangioma is one of the most common benign tumors of infancy. The natural evolution includes rapid growth followed by gradual involution. Airway hemangiomas are not that common, but they can lead to dyspnoea, as well as to life-threatening complications.Two children aged 3 months were admitted to the Pediatric Department with difficulties in breathing and with biphasic stridor. They had previously been hospitalized because of the same symptoms and misdiagnosed as having an upper respiratory tract infection. The previous treatment included intravenous or inhaled corticosteroids, without any significant improvement. Laryngoscopy was performed for both of the children. There was a mass in the subglottic area with the appearance of a hemangioma causing significant airway stenosis. We started treatment with propranolol at a dose of 1 mg/kg/day twice daily. The dose was gradually increased up to 3 mg/kg/day, under close monitoring. In the first 7 to 10 days after initiation of treatment, we observed a significant improvement of the respiratory distress. The second laryngoscopy showed an almost complete involution of the mass in the subglottis. The focus of this article will be primarily on the clinical presentation and the therapeutic response of subglottic hemangioma, along with a literature review on the subject.
