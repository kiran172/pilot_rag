Title: Efficacy and safety of unilateral biportal endoscopy compared with microscopic decompression in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Systematic evaluation of the efficacy and safety of unilateral biportal endoscopic decompression in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature search and compared the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and retrospective studies of unilateral biportal endoscopy (UBE) and microscopic decompression (MD) in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis from several databases.
RESULTS: Seven studies were included. The results of meta-analysis showed that the operation time of UBE was shorter than that of MD. [SMD = -0.443, 95% CI (-0.717, -0.169), P  = .002]. Compared with MD, the patients' back pain was slighter on the 1st day, 1-2 months and 6 months after UBE. During the long-term follow-up, there was no significant difference in back pain between MD and UBE [SMD = -0.519, 95% CI (-0.934, -0.104), P  = .014]. There was no significant difference in lower limb visual analogue score (VAS) score between UBE decompression and MD [SMD = -0.105, 95% CI (-0.356, 0.146), P  = .412]. The results of meta-analysis showed that the C-reactive protein (CRP) level of UBE was lower than that of MD [weighted mean difference = -1.437, 95% CI (-2.347, -0.527), P  = .002]. There was no significant difference in other clinical effects between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSION: The operation time of UBE was shorter than that of MD, and it was superior to micro decompression in early back VAS score, lower limb VAS score and early postoperative CRP level. There was no statistical difference between UBE and MD in other outcomes.
