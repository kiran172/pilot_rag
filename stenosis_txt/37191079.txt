Title: Evolving Endotracheal Tube Preferences and Practices: Intensivist Knowledge Gaps and Sex Disparities.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The complex management of intubation-related laryngeal injury makes prevention vital. The purpose of this study is to assess endotracheal tube (ETT) practices and preferences among intensivists at our institution.
METHODS: Chart review of intubated patients and intensivist survey were simultaneously performed in January 2016 and August 2022. A height-to-ETT size ratio (H:ETT) was calculated for each patient in the 2022 cohort. Intubated patients were followed until tracheostomy, extubation, or death occurred. Surveys assessed intensivist preferences for ETT size and management of intubated patients.
RESULTS: 300 ICU patients were included. The mean ETT size for males decreased from 7.73 ± 0.30 in 2016 to 7.57 ± 0.25 in 2022 (p < 0.001). The average H:ETT of men was higher than females (p = 0.004), indicating that females in this population were intubated with larger ETTs relative to their height compared to males. Whereas the majority (66.7%) of intensivists endorse 7.0 ETTs as the standard for women, the majority (70%) of women at our institution are intubated with a 7.5 ETT or larger. Of intubated patients in the ICU, 23 (19.5%) were intubated for 11 days or longer.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to men, women are intubated with larger-than-preferred ETTs relative to height. Additionally, patients in our study were intubated for longer than preferred based on intensivist surveys, putting this population at higher risk for acute laryngeal injury (AlgI)-related laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS). Further studies should seek to identify similar trends and barriers to reducing ALgI-related LTS.
