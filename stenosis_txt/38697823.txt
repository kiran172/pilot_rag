Title: Carcinoid syndrome with right-sided valve involvement - a case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The survival of patients with neuroendocrine tumors has substantially improved with modern treatment options. Although the associated carcinoid syndrome can be diagnosed early and controlled effectively, cardiologists still encounter patients with cardiac manifestations, particularly among individuals with persistently high levels of vasoactive mediators. Treatment options have been limited to surgical valve replacement in fully manifested disease. Since surgery is not always feasible, transcatheter valve implantation is becoming an interesting alternative.
CASE: A case of a 50-year-old woman with carcinoid syndrome and right-sided valvular heart disease is presented. Moderate pulmonary valve stenosis and severe tricuspid valve regurgitation were diagnosed during the evaluation and treatment of neuroendocrine tumor. The possibility of rare valve involvement and the need for interdisciplinary cooperation in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients with neuroendocrine tumors producing vasoactive substances must be emphasized.
CONCLUSION: The patient had a typically presenting carcinoid syndrome with a rare cardiac manifestation. Although monitoring and treatment were carried out in accordance with recommendations and appropriate to the clinical condition, rapid progression of the metastatic disease ultimately precluded invasive cardiac intervention.
