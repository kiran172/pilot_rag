Title: Comparison of Solitaire and Neuroform Stenting for Coiling of Intracranial Bifurcation Aneurysms.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the technical performance and outcomes of Solitaire and Neuroform stents for treatment of intracranial bifurcation aneurysms (IBAs).
METHODS: IBAs treated by stent-assisted coiling using a Solitaire or Neuroform stent between October 2010 and December 2019 were retrospectively evaluated. Patient demographics, aneurysm information, treatment technique, periprocedural and device-related complications, parent artery angle change, along with initial and follow-up angiographic results were analyzed.
RESULTS: One hundred twenty-one patients with 121 IBAs treated with Solitaire (n = 101) or Neuroform (n = 20) stent-assisted coiling were included. Aneurysm size, thrombotic and hemorrhagic complication rate, initial occlusion rate and in-stent stenosis between the two cohorts were not significantly different. Aneurysm location was significantly different between the two groups (p = 0.032). Jailing technique rate for coiling was significantly higher in the Solitaire than the Neuroform group (70.3% vs. 35.0%, p < 0.01). Follow-up DSA demonstrated a significantly lower recurrence rate for the Solitaire cohort (2.9% vs. 22.2%, p = 0.016). Parent artery angle changes, immediately post-operative and on follow-up were significantly greater in the Solitaire stent group (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: For intracranial bifurcation aneurysms, Solitaire stent-assisted coiling achieved a significantly lower recurrence rate and induced more favorable parent artery angular remodeling than Neuroform stenting.
