Title: Perfusion and oxygenation in allografts with transplant renal artery stenosis: Evaluation with functional magnetic resonance imaging.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) has been shown to reduce kidney perfusion leading to post-operative hypertension. We aimed to measure the perfusion and oxygenation changes in TRAS with arterial spin labeling (ASL) and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging, respectively.
METHODS: In this single-center prospective study, a total of seven patients with TRAS and seven age- and sex-matched normal kidney transplant recipients underwent both ASL and BOLD imaging. Moreover, measurements of ASL and BOLD were also performed in five patients after successful angioplasty for TRAS.
RESULTS: Allograft cortical perfusion as measured by ASL in the TRAS group was significantly decreased as compared with normal control group (129.9 ± 46.6 ml/100 g vs. 202.4 ± 47.7 ml/100 g, P = .01). Interestingly, allograft oxygenation as indicated by R2* derived from BOLD in both the cortex (16.42 ± 1.90 Hz vs. 18.25 ± 4.34 Hz, P = .33) and the medulla (30.34 ± 2.35 Hz vs. 30.43 ± 6.85 Hz, P = .97) showed no statistical difference between the TRAS and normal control group. In addition, both cortical and medullary oxygenation remained unchanged despite significantly improved cortical perfusion in those undergone successful angioplasty.
CONCLUSION: Cortical and medullary oxygenation were preserved in the presence of reduced allograft perfusion in clinically significant TRAS. Prospective larger studies are needed to conclusively establish perfusion and oxygenation changes in TRAS.
