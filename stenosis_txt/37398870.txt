Title: An Update on Anti-thrombotic Therapy Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Expert Cardiologist Opinion from a UK and Ireland Delphi Group.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is an effective and established treatment for symptomatic aortic stenosis. However, there is a lack of consensus concerning the need for peri- and post-procedural anti-thrombotic medication. Contemporary guidelines recommend that anti-thrombotic therapy is balanced against a patient's bleeding risk following TAVI, but do not fully consider the evolving evidence base. The purpose of the Delphi panel recommendations presented here is to provide a consensus elicited from a panel of experts who regularly prescribe anti-thrombotic therapy post-TAVI. The goal was to address evidence gaps across four key topics: anti-thrombotic therapy (anti-platelet and/or anti-coagulant) in TAVI patients in sinus rhythm; anti-thrombotic therapy in TAVI patients with AF; direct oral anti-coagulants versus vitamin K antagonists; and the need for UK/Ireland specific guidance. This consensus statement aims to inform clinical decision-making by providing a concise, evidence-based summary of best practice for prescribing anti-thrombotic therapies following TAVI and highlights areas where further research is needed.
