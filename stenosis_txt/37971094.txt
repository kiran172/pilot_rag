Title: Percutaneous treatment of mechanical mitral valve thrombosis.

Abstract: A 75-year-old female was found to have mechanical mitral valve thrombosis complicated by severe mitral stenosis, pulmonary edema, and right heart failure. She was at prohibitive risk for surgical intervention. She did not tolerate thrombolysis due to bleeding. We performed percutaneous intervention with cerebral protection with subsequent restoration of mechanical mitral valve function, resolution of the mitral valve stenosis, and no neurologic complications.
