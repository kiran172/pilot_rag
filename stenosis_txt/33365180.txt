Title: Spinal fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe ankylosing spondylitis (AS) affects the entire spine, increasing the risk of vertebral fractures. There are several fusion procedures used (e.g., anterior, posterior, or combined 360Â° procedures) to stabilize these fractures.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 45-year-old male with a 33-year diagnosis of AS presented with a progressive quadriparesis of 6 months' duration. Previously, he had surgery on both hips. The medical report documented degenerative spondylolisthesis at the C5-C6 level along with syndesmophytes a herniated disc and stenosis. Following a circumferential decompression/fusion without complications, the patient's symptoms resolved.
CONCLUSION: For patients presenting with cervical fractures and AS, circumferential surgical decompression/ fusion may result in good outcomes.
