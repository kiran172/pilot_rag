Title: Unilateral peripheral slow flow phenomenon without significant stenosis in lower extremity artery: can primary peripheral slow flow be a new phenomenon?

Abstract: Peripheral artery disease affects nearly a quarter billion of the world's population, and it is one of the most important causes of decreased quality of life. Primary peripheral slow flow without significant stenosis in peripheral arteries has not been previously reported in the literature. In this case report, we present a slow flow phenomenon that extended from the right external iliac artery to the distal peripheral bed observed during peripheral angiography in a patient who exhibited pain and claudication in the right lower extremity after walking 50 m. Medical treatment provided symptomatic improvement in coronary slow flow and led to a decrease in claudication. Future randomised controlled studies conducted on patients with suspected peripheral slow flow phenomenon would increase our knowledge on both the aetiology and treatment of this condition.
