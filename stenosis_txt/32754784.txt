Title: Minimally Invasive Retrosternal Esophageal Bypass Using a Mid-Colon Esophagocoloplasty for Corrosive-Induced Esophageal Stricture.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Colonic bypass for corrosive-induced esophageal stricture is traditionally performed using an open approach. The laparoscopic mid-colon retrosternal esophageal bypass has not been previously reported. The present study is aimed to report the feasibility of laparoscopic mid-colon esophagocoloplasty and to compare the short- and medium-term outcomes with the open approach.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent surgery for corrosive esophageal stricture between August 2016 and August 2019 were retrospectively analyzed. Laparoscopic procedure was preferred in patients with stricture starting at or below the level of cricopharynx and without prior laparotomy. The perioperative and medium-term outcomes of patients who underwent open and laparoscopic mid-colon bypass were compared.
RESULTS: Of the 15 patients, seven patients underwent laparoscopic mid-colon bypass, and eight patients underwent the open procedure. The duration of surgery was less in the laparoscopic group, but the difference was not significant (440 vs. 510 min, P = 0.93). Intraoperative blood loss (median) and postoperative analgesic requirement (median days) were significantly lower in laparoscopic group (200 mL vs. 350 mL, P = 0.03 & 3 vs. 5, P = 0.02). There was no significant difference in the postoperative complications, ICU and hospital stay between the two groups. At a median (range) follow-up of 14 (7-42) months, all patients in the minimally invasive colon bypass group were euphagic to regular Indian diet. Two patients in the open group developed anastomotic stricture requiring endoscopic dilatation.
CONCLUSION: Minimally invasive mid-colon esophageal bypass is a feasible procedure for selected patients with corrosive esophageal stricture with favorable short-term and comparable medium-term outcomes.
