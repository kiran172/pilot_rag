Title: Treatment of Sub-Acute Intracranial Stent Occlusion with Rescue Stenting After Failed Aspiration and Stent Retriever Thrombectomy.

Abstract: We report a case of middle age man presented a subacute balloon-mounted stent occlusion placed for M1 segment occlusion stroke due to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis after thrombectomy failure and treated with a second balloon-mounted stent within the first one. Successful recanalization and complete clinical recovery were achieved. The coronary balloon-mounted stent is s a useful tool as a rescue treatment in case of intracranial stent occlusion.
