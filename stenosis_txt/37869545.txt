Title: Factors affecting successful immediate indirect decompression in oblique lateral interbody fusion in lumbar spinal stenosis patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) offers indirect decompression of stenotic lesions of the spinal canal and foramen through immediate disc height restoration. Only a few studies have reported the effect of cage position and associated intraoperatively modifiable factors for successful immediate indirect decompression following OLIF surgery. This study aimed to investigate the intraoperatively modifiable factors for successful radiological outcomes of OLIF.
METHODS: This study included 46 patients with 80 surgical levels who underwent OLIF without direct posterior decompression. Preoperative and postoperative radiological parameters were evaluated and intraoperatively modifiable radiologic parameters for successful immediate radiologic decompression on magnetic resonance image (MRI) were determined. Radiologic parameters were preoperative and postoperative radiological parameters including anterior disc height (ADH), posterior disc height (PDH) lumbar lordotic angle (LLA), segmental lordotic angle (SLA), foraminal height (FH), cage position, cross-sectional area (CSA) of the thecal sac, cross-sectional foraminal area (CSF), facet distance (FD).
RESULTS: All radiologic outcomes significantly improved. Comparing preoperative and postoperative values, mean CSA increased from 99.63±40.21 mm2 to 125.02±45.90 mm2 (p&lt;.0001), and mean left CSF increased from 44.54±12.90 mm2 to 69.91±10.80 mm2 (p&lt;.0001). FD also increased from 1.40±0.44 to 1.92±0.71 mm (p&lt;.0001). FH increased from 16.31±3.3 to 18.84±3.47 mm (p&lt;.0001). ADH and PDH also significantly increased (p&lt;.0001). Immediate postoperative CSF and FH improvement rate (%) were significantly correlated with posterior disc height restoration rate (%) (p=.0443, and p=.0234, respectively). In addition, the patients with a cage positioned in the middle of the vertebral body experienced a greater FH improvement rate (%) compared to the patients with a cage positioned anteriorly. Finally, Visual analogue scale (VAS) for leg pain was improved immediately.
CONCLUSIONS: OLIF provided satisfactory immediate indirect decompression in central and foraminal spinal stenosis. Moreover, intraoperative surgical technique for successful radiologic CSF and FH improvement included restoration of the PDH and placement of the cage in the middle.
