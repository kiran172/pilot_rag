Title: Perioperative and functionnal outcomes of robot-assisted laparoscopic versus open ureterovesical reimplantation for benign lower ureteral pathologies: a single-center comparative study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The robot-assisted laparoscopic (RALUVR) and open (OUVR) approaches have both been described for ureterovesical reimplantation to treat benign lower ureteral pathologies. Thus, we aimed to compare the perioperative and functional outcomes of RALUVR vs. OUVR.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective comparative study including all consecutive patients treated with RALUVR or OUVR for benign lower ureteral pathologies between January 2013 and December 2022 at our center. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the predictors of complication ≥ Clavien-Dindo (CD) III within 90 days, prolonged length of stay (LOS), and 90-day overall success. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analyses were used to assess vesicoureteral reflux-free (VU-RFS) and stenosis-free (SFS) survivals.
RESULTS: Overall, 44 patients underwent RALUVR (n = 19; 43%) and OUVR (n = 25; 57%). In univariable logistic regression analyses, the use of RALUVR vs. OUVR was not significantly associated with postoperative complications ≥ CDIII (OR = 0.98; 95% CI=[0.17-5.09]; p = 0.98), and 90-day overall success (OR = 1.43; 95% CI=[0.24-11.28]; p = 0.7). Despite a shorter median LOS after RALUVR vs. OUVR (4 vs. 10 days, respectively; p < 0.001), multivariable logistic regression analysis showed no impact of the surgical approach on prolonged LOS (OR = 0.51, 95% CI=[0.03-13.86]; p = 0.65). No significant difference was observed in 2-year VU-RFS (72.9% vs. 100%, respectively; p = 0.2) and 2-year SFS between the RALUVR and OUVR groups (85.7% vs. 87.7%, respectively; p = 0.8). In Cox regression analysis, the use of RALUVR vs. OUVR was not significantly associated with VU-RFS (HR = 4.26; 95% CI=[0.38-47.84]; p = 0.24) or SFS (HR = 1.32; 95% CI=[0.22-8.01]; p = 0.76).
CONCLUSION: We observed that RALUVR provides similar perioperative and functional outcomes as compared to OUVR, except for potentially shorter LOS.
