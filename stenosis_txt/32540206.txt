Title: Diagnostic value of comprehensive on-site and off-site coronary CT angiography for identifying hemodynamically obstructive coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic value of comprehensive on-site coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) using stenosis and plaque measures and subtended myocardial mass (V<sub>sub</sub>) for fractional flow reserve (FFR) defined hemodynamically obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Additionally, the incremental diagnostic value of off-site CT-derived FFR (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) was assessed.
METHODS: Prospectively enrolled patients underwent CCTA followed by invasive FFR interrogation of all major coronary arteries. Vessels with ≥30% stenosis were included for analysis. On-site CCTA assessment included qualitative and quantitative stenosis (visual grading and minimal lumen area, MLA) and plaque measures (characteristics and volumes), and V<sub>sub</sub>. Diagnostic value of comprehensive on-site CCTA assessment was tested by comparing area under the curves (AUC). In vessels with available FFR<sub>CT</sub>, the incremental value of off-site FFR<sub>CT</sub> was tested.
RESULTS: In 236 vessels (132 patients), MLA, positive remodeling, non-calcified plaque volume, and V<sub>sub</sub> were independent on-site CCTA predictors for hemodynamically obstructive CAD (p &lt; 0.05 for all). V<sub>sub</sub>/MLA2 outperformed all these on-site CCTA parameters (AUC = 0.85) and V<sub>sub</sub> was incremental to all other CCTA predictors (p = 0.02). In subgroup analysis (n = 194 vessels), diagnostic performance of FFR<sub>CT</sub> and V<sub>sub</sub>/MLA2 was similar (AUC 0.89 and 0.85 respectively, p = 0.25). Furthermore, diagnostic performance significantly albeit minimally increased when FFR<sub>CT</sub> was added to on-site CCTA assessment (ΔAUC = 0.03, p = 0.02).
CONCLUSIONS: In comprehensive on-site CCTA assessment, V<sub>sub</sub>/MLA2 demonstrated greatest diagnostic value for hemodynamically obstructive CAD and V<sub>sub</sub> was incremental to all evaluated CCTA indices. Additionally, adding FFR<sub>CT</sub> only minimally increased diagnostic performance, demonstrating that on-site CCTA assessment is a reasonable alternative to FFR<sub>CT</sub>.
