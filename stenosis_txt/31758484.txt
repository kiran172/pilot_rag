Title: Ectopic pancreatitis in the antral stomach causing gastric outlet obstruction: a case of successful resection.

Abstract: Ectopic pancreas is a congenital developmental anomaly that may be caused by embryologic errors. The pathogenetic details of ectopic pancreas remain unclear, but it has gradually been determined to originate at the gene level. DNA errors during embryological development cause ectopic pancreas. Ectopic pancreas is generally asymptomatic and harmless throughout the patient's entire life; in very rare cases, however, it can be symptomatic and harmful, causing pain, fever, bleeding, and other adverse effects. We herein report an unusual case involving a 52-year-old Japanese woman who presented with nausea and vomiting due to inflammation of an ectopic pancreas in the gastric antrum. Ectopic pancreatitis caused severe pyloric stenosis, and she was unable to ingest food or water even after admission to the internal medicine ward. Ectopic pancreatitis is a very rare clinical condition, but clinicians should be cautious of this uncommon disease in patients who develop gastric outlet obstruction without cancer or ulcers. The present case report is clinically significant because surgical treatment (distal partial gastrectomy) relieved the patient's serious distress rapidly and successfully after unsuccessful conservative treatments for acute ectopic pancreatitis. Antrectomy (distal partial gastrectomy) might be useful for ectopic pancreas, especially in case of gastric outlet obstruction due to the ectopic pancreatitis.
