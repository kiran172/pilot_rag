Title: Impact of Frailty and Mitral Valve Surgery on Outcomes of Severe Mitral Stenosis Due to Mitral Annular Calcification.

Abstract: We sought to evaluate the outcomes of patients with severe mitral stenosis (MS) resulting from mitral annular calcification and assessed the prognostic impact of co-morbidities and frailty in guiding management. Among 6,915 patients with calcific MS who underwent echocardiography between January 2011 and March 2020, a total of 283 patients with severe calcific MS were retrospectively enrolled. We calculated the Charlson co-morbidity index (CCI). Frailty was scored from 0 to 3 points, with 1 point each assigned for reduced hemoglobin, reduced albumin, and inactivity. The primary end point was all-cause death. The mean age was 72 ± 11 years. The mean mitral valve (MV) area was 1.1 ± 0.4 cm2, and the mean transmitral gradient was 12 ± 4 mm Hg. Although 33% of the patients underwent MV intervention, 67% were conservatively managed. During a median follow-up of 360 days, 35% died. Patients who underwent MV intervention had an improved prognosis compared with those who were treated conservatively, even after propensity score matching. On multivariate Cox regression analysis, higher CCI (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 1.38, p = 0.011) and frailty score (HR 1.58, 95% CI 1.12 to 2.23, p = 0.01) were predictors of all-cause mortality, and MV intervention (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.83, p = 0.011) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker use (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.79, p = 0.009) were associated with an improved prognosis. In conclusion, patients with severe calcific MS were often frail with multiple co-morbidities and were often managed conservatively. Higher CCI and worse frailty were associated with worse prognosis, regardless of the treatment strategy. MV intervention for select patients was associated with improved prognosis.
