Title: The risk of acute coronary events in microvascular disease.

Abstract: The microvascular disease represents a widespread clinical entity in the general population, especially among women. The dysfunction of the microcirculation is often responsible for myocardial ischaemia and angina in the absence of significant stenosis of the epicardial district, while in other cases it can represent a contributing cause of angina even in the presence of coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies or heart failure. The cardiovascular risk factors of people with microvascular disease are similar to those who develop epicardial atherosclerotic disease. However, the prognostic significance of microvascular disease remains a matter of debate. An element to be clarified, in fact, is whether subjects with dysfunction of the microcirculation and coronary tree without significant stenoses present an increased risk of myocardial infarction and sudden death. In recent years, several studies seem to confirm an association between microvascular disease and progression of coronary epicardial atherosclerosis. The prognosis of microvascular disease would therefore not be benign as was previously believed, but associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events including revascularization, heart attack, and cardiac death.
