Title: Postpartum Spinal Epidural Lipomatosis With Epidural Venous Engorgement.

Abstract: Spinal epidural lipomatosis (SEL) refers to a condition characterized by the abnormal growth of fatty tissue within the vertebral canal, situated outside the spinal canal itself. This expansion of fat can result in symptoms such as back pain and radiculopathy. The majority of cases remain without noticeable symptoms. However, when SEL does cause symptoms, it is frequently linked to using external steroids. The contributing factors to SEL include obesity and Cushing's syndrome. The presentation of SEL can mimic other spinal disorders such as epidural hematoma, spinal stenosis, and degenerative joint disease. Patients might present with gradually progressing and long-standing complaints of back pain, muscle weakness, numbness, loss of bladder or bowel control, lack of coordination, abnormal reflexes, and, in rare instances, paralysis. We are reporting a case involving a 34-year-old female with obesity, who experienced sudden weakness in her left lower extremity shortly after a recent uncomplicated vaginal delivery using epidural analgesia. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her thoracic (T) and lumbar spine revealed spinal cord compression secondary to extensive posterior epidural lipomatosis associated with epidural venous engorgement. The patient underwent an immediate laminectomy procedure at the T3, T5, T7, and T9 levels to alleviate the compression. Postoperatively, she underwent a course of physiotherapy and gradually regained her normal muscle strength. She wasÂ discharged in stable condition on the sixth day after the surgery.
