Title: Lacrimal Ductal Fistula After Lateral Canthoplasty.

Abstract: We report a rare case of lacrimal ductal fistula in a patient who underwent esthetic lateral canthoplasty. A 37-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with tearing in right eye after cosmetic lateral canthoplasty of both eyes. The patient was treated with silicone tube intubation at a local medical center, but the symptoms were not resolved. Lacrimal sac irrigation tests and paranasal computed tomography (CT) were performed to analyze the possibility of lacrimal pathway obstruction. However, there was no evidence of acquired lacrimal duct stenosis. The teardrop leaked out through a small orifice in the right lateral canthal area and it increased in size over time. We identified lacrimal ductal fistula and performed lacrimal fistulectomy. The tearing at right lateral canthus area was resolved. There were no more recurrences nor any other complications 2 years after surgery.
