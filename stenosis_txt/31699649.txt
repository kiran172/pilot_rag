Title: Primary Retrograde Tibio-Pedal Approach for Endovascular Intervention of Femoropopliteal Disease with Chronic Total Occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the feasibility, safety, and the acute outcome of primary retrograde tibio pedal approach (TPA) in the treatment of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) with femoropopliteal (FP) chronic total occlusion (CTO).
BACKGROUND: With maturing in endovascular technology and further development in new devices, endovascular therapy has become a comparable and preferred treatment for patients with PAD. The retrograde TPA has not been studied to treat FP CTO extensively.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of 98 consecutive patients who underwent peripheral angiogram and intervention of 123 FP CTO lesions from June 1st, 2016 to June 30th, 2018 in a single center. Peripheral angiography and percutaneous balloon angioplasty was done primarily via retrograde TPA. Demographic data, procedural success rate, peri-procedural major adverse complications, and 30-day outcomes were recorded.
RESULTS: Out of 123 procedures, the dorsalis pedis artery/distal anterior tibial artery was the most common TPA site (59%) followed by the posterior tibial artery in 27% patients and peroneal artery in 14% patients. In 40 (33%) FP CTO lesions, additional transradial accesses were needed for controlled antegrade and retrograde tracking (CART) technique. Overall procedural success was achieved in 122 FP CTO (99%) lesions. No patients had significant access site bleeding, hematoma, worsening kidney dysfunction or acute limb ischemia within 30-day following this procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: The primary retrograde TPA for FP CTO lesions is safe and feasible. With a combination of tibio pedal and transradial approach, our procedural success rate is very high for FP CTO intervention.
