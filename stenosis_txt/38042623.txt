Title: Clinical Application of Dark-blood Imaging in Head and Neck CT Angiography: Effect on Image Quality and Plaque Visibility.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to explore the potential of a newly developed dark-blood imaging technique to improve image quality and plaque visibility in head and neck computed tomography (CT) angiography.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients who underwent triphasic head and neck CT angiography scans from August 2021 to March 2023 were retrospectively enrolled (mean age 67.23 ± 10.81 [SD] years, range 43-85 years, 64.7% male). The CT protocol consists of pre-contrast, arterial and delayed phases. Dark-blood images were postprocessed with the contrast-enhancement boost (CE-boost) technique. The quantitative assessment involved evaluating the CT value, image noise, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of calcified plaque and non-calcified plaque. The plaque CNR relative to the vessel lumen (CNR<sub>plaque-lumen</sub>), vessel wall (CNR<sub>plaque-wall</sub>), and adjacent muscle (CNR<sub>plaque-muscle</sub>) was respectively calculated. Two experienced radiologists independently evaluated the CT images (5, best; 1, worst) by four characteristics including calcified plaque visibility, non-calcified plaque visibility, diagnostic confidence, and overall image quality. Inter-rater variability was also evaluated. The artery stenosis rate and plaque burden on dark-blood images were measured and compared with arterial phases. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used for consistency analysis. The diagnostic accuracy of dark-blood images for the stenosis rate was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: A total of 43 patients with 54 calcified plaques and 34 non-calcified plaques were assessed in this study. When compared with pre-contrast and delayed phase, dark-blood images yielded significantly higher CNR<sub>plaque-lumen</sub> and CNR<sub>plaque-muscle</sub> of calcified (219.79 ± 159.20 and 181.23 ± 112.12, respectively) and non-calcified (30.30 ± 29.11 and 6.28 ± 4.75, respectively) plaques (all p &lt; 0.001). Calcified plaque SNR of dark-blood showed equal or slightly lower than other phases (p &gt; 0.05 or p = 0.02). A major increase was observed in the non-calcified plaque SNR of dark-blood compared to the arterial phase (5.56 ± 3.71 vs. 4.23 ± 3.56, p = 0.02), although there were no apparent differences compared to pre-contrast and delayed phases (p &gt; 0.05). In subjective analyzes, the calcified plaque visibility (4.99 ± 0.07), non-calcified plaque visibility (4.62 ± 0.48), overall image quality (4.81 ± 0.34), and diagnostic confidence (4.74 ± 0.36) in dark-blood images dominated the highest scores (p &lt; 0.001). The subjective scores of radiologists exhibited good consistency (all kappa value&gt;0.7). The dark-blood image and the arterial phase image exhibited good consistency in identifying the stenosis rate (p &lt; 0.001). In the evaluation of plaque burden, the interobserver agreement for dark-blood images was higher compared to arterial phase images (ICC = 0.870 vs. 0.729).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to conventional triphasic head and neck CT angiography, the CE-boost derived dark-blood imaging demonstrated a significant improvement in image quality and visibility for both calcified and non-calcified plaque assessment.
