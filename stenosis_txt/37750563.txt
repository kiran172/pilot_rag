Title: Pickering Syndrome: An Overlooked Renovascular Cause of Recurrent Heart Failure.

Abstract: ABSTRACTRecurring and rapidly developing (flash) pulmonary edema is the hallmark of Pickering syndrome, affecting patients with hypertension and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (either bilateral or unilateral) in a solitary functioning kidney, and impaired renal function. We herein report on a series of consecutive patients with recurrent hospital admissions for pulmonary edema, impaired renal function (chronic kidney disease class 4-5), and atherosclerotic bilateral renal artery stenosis, in whom Pickering syndrome had been long neglected. We also describe a streamlined diagnostic strategy entailing little or no need for contrast medium, thus carrying no risks of further worsening of renal function. This allowed us to make the correct diagnosis and opened the way to revascularization by percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with stent, which provided swift recovery of kidney function with resolution of pulmonary congestion and long-term pulmonary edema- and dialysis-free survival in all cases. In summary, these findings support the following key messages: (1) considering the diagnosis of Pickering syndrome, followed by searching atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis, is an essential step toward a life-saving revascularization that avoids dialysis and an otherwise poor outcome; and (2) a simplified strategy entailing little or no need for contrast medium, carrying no associated risks of deteriorating renal function, permits the diagnosis of Pickering syndrome.
