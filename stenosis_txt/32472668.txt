Title: Limb-shaking transient ischemic attack with facial muscles involuntary twitch successfully treated with internal carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Limb-shaking transient ischemic attack (LS-TIA) is a clinical disease with severe carotid stenosis, which is characterized by unilateral rhythmic dance or tremor like involuntary movements of arms and/or legs, but facial muscles are usually unaffected.
METHODS: Today, we report a 42-year-old man with transient ischemic attack who suffered from right limb shaking and right facial muscle twitching due to the obvious stenosis of left internal carotid artery (ICA). Written informed consent was obtained from participants according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and a local ethic committee approved the study. ICA angioplasty and stent implantation were performed as treatment attempts. A brain protection device was navigated through the lesion and placed at the distal end of the stenosis.
RESULT: The patient successfully completed the recanalization through stent placement, and the involuntary shaking of limbs and face was improved. During the 3-month follow-up, the patient's symptoms disappeared completely and did not attack again.
CONCLUSION: This case report highlights the importance of accurate diagnosis and treatment, because treatment-related carotid artery occlusion can not only eliminate the attack, but also reduce the risk of future stroke.
