Title: Osteochondroma Arising From the Inferior Articular Process of the Lumbar Spine in a Geriatric Patient: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Spinal osteochondromas are rare, and approximately less than 5% occur as spinal lesions. We report the case of a solitary osteochondroma of the spine and review and update the literature on spinal osteochondroma, including surgical treatment and subsequent results.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 73-year-old female patient complained of a 10-year history of back pain and a 4-year history of right-side lower extremity radiating pain with paresthesia. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a bony mass arising from the inferior articular process (IAP) of L3, presenting with features of compressive spinal stenosis at the L3-L4 level. The treatment strategy included the complete marginal excision of the lesion through the posterior approach, as well as complete decompression of the spinal canal and nerve roots. The patient's symptoms resolved after surgery, and histopathological examination identified the lesion as an osteochondroma.
REVIEW RESULTS: This review study included 168 solitary osteochondroma cases. The most commonly involved spinal level was cervical (51.8%), and the most frequent spinal anatomic column involved was the posterior column (70.8%). Radiculopathy accounted for 30.3% of all cases, myelopathy accounted for 31.0%, and 7.7% exhibited both symptoms simultaneously. The recurrence rate was 6.0%.
CONCLUSION: Computed tomography and MRI can effectively diagnose spinal osteochondroma, and surgical treatment can effectively improve clinical outcomes. In almost all symptomatic cases, the best treatment is marginal excision of the tumor. Complete resection of the cartilaginous cap of the tumor is especially important to prevent recurrence.
