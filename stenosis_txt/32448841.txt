Title: A Resected Case of Follicular Cholangitis That Was Positive on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron Emission Tomography.

Abstract: We experienced a case of follicular cholangitis that was positive on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (18F-FDG-PET). A 70-year-old man was admitted for jaundice. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography showed stenosis of the middle to upper choledocus. 18F-FDG-PET depicted a localized hot spot at the stenotic lesion (maximum standardized uptake value = 8.2). Although no malignant findings were found in the cytology or on a bile duct biopsy, malignancy could not be excluded, so surgical treatment was performed. Follicular cholangitis is a new, rare disease that causes severe biliary stricture. Only 11 cases of follicular cholangitis have been reported, including the present case.
