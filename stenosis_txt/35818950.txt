Title: [Implantation materials in reconstructive surgery of the larynx and trachea].

Abstract: The article presents a literature review, that analyzes the use of implantation materials in reconstructive plastic surgery of the larynx and trachea in patients with local and extended laryngeal-tracheal stenosis, including lumen obliteration. 48 literature sources were studied. The positive and negative aspects of biological and synthetic implant materials use have been determined. The choice of an implantation material that meets all the demands for the complete restoration of the respiratory tract determines the relevance of the problem raised.
