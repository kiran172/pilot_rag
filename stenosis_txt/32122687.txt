Title: Reproductive and obstetric outcomes after abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) for patients with early-stage cervical cancers in Fudan, China.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report the reproductive and obstetric outcomes of patients undergoing abdominal radical trachelectomy (ART) for the treatment of early-stage cervical cancers in Fudan, China.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a prospectively collected database of 360 patients with stage IA1-IB1 cervical cancers who underwent ART between 2004 and 2018.
RESULTS: Overall, 211 women (58.6%) did not plan to get pregnant immediately after ART, and 89.6% of them were due to childbearing before surgery or unmarried. Among 149 women who attempted to conceive, 26 (17.4%) of them achieved 30 pregnancies. Eighty-six patients (57.7%) had infertility problems, 44 attempted to conceive with assisted reproductive technologies, and 12 (27.3%) succeeded. Post-operative cervical stenosis (26, 27.4%) and fallopian tube obstruction (22, 23.2%) were the most common reasons for infertility after surgery. Among the patients who conceived, there were 3 first-trimester miscarriages, 6 second-trimester miscarriages, and 2 elective terminations. A total of 19 pregnancies reached the third trimester, and 84.2% of them ended after 36Â weeks. Twelve of 20 cases in patients with cerclage placed had full-term birth, while 3 of 5 patients without cerclage placed suffered from second-trimester miscarriage or preterm birth.
CONCLUSIONS: Immediately after ART, many patients were reluctant to conceive, while others suffered from cervical stenosis or fallopian tube obstruction, which had led to low pregnancy rate. Pregnant patients might experience miscarriage or preterm labor which could be prevented by cervical cerclage. Assisted reproductive technology should be encouraged to improve obstetric outcomes.
