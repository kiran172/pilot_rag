Title: Update in the treatment of intracranial atherosclerotic disease.

Abstract: This review highlights the recent evolution of the imaging, medical management, surgical options and endovascular therapies for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD). Recent imaging developments including optical coherence tomography and other modalities to assess the intracranial arteries for symptomatic ICAD are reviewed, not only to diagnose ICAD but to determine if ICAD plaques have any high-risk features for treatment. Potential future developments in the treatment of ICAD are discussed, including the development of trackable drug-coated balloons for the cerebral circulation to treat primary or restenotic arteries, new iterations of self-expanding intracranial stents with easier delivery systems, and the re-examination of indirect surgical bypass techniques for revascularisation. In addition to these important technological developments, however, is the evolving evidence regarding the best treatment window for these techniques and additional factors in medical management which can improve patient outcomes in this devastating pathology.
