Title: Missed bronchial web in a 4-year-old boy with foreign body aspiration: A case report.

Abstract: Congenital bronchial webs are extremely rare and usually remain undiagnosed due to nonspecific symptoms. Herein, we reported a 4-year-old case of the bronchial web who was initially undiagnosed upon bronchoscopy following foreign body aspiration and afterward misdiagnosed as childhood asthma through his consistent cough and exertional dyspnea for several months.
