Title: The Femoral Vein as a Long-Term Aorto-Iliac Graft for Aortic Infection and Aortitis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Reconstruction of the aorto-iliac segment with femoral vein (FV) as substitute for infected synthetic grafts or mycotic aneurysms constitutes the most sustainably convenient alternative. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term outcome of up to 16 years of follow-up, analysing the morphologic adaption of the FV with special emphasis on the distal and proximal anastomoses.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 22 patients with 109 computed tomography angiograms (CTAs) treated between August 2001 and January 2020 in case of aortic infection/aortitis. Morphologic changes like anastomotic dilatation/stenosis as well as changes of FV wall thickness were retrospectively analysed in pre- and postoperative CTAs.
RESULTS: Elective procedure was done in 17/22 (77%) cases, and 5/22 (23%) patients required emergent surgery. The median follow-up was 91.5 months (P<sub>25</sub>;P<sub>75</sub> = 21;117). Cross-sectional diameter of proximal (20.38 ± 3.77 vs 22.04 ± 3.97 mm, p = 0.007) and distal anastomoses (13.05 ± 4.23 vs 14.61 ± 5.19 mm, p = 0.05) increased significantly, as well as the proximal and distal anastomotic areas (3.36 ± 1.29 vs 4.32 ± 1.63 mm2, p = 0.04 and 0.99 ± 0.48 vs 1.25 ± 0.72 mm2, p = 0.023, respectively). Venous wall thickness was significantly reduced at the anastomotic site (1.74 ± 0.46 vs 1.24 ± 0.31 mm, p = 0.001). The upper thigh diameter did not differ before and after harvesting of the FV (161.6 ± 29.1 vs. 178.2 ± 23.3 mm, p = 0.326, respectively).
CONCLUSION: This long-term CTA follow-up study showed that the FV wall becomes thinner at the anastomotic site, and the anastomoses dilate with time without rupture. The FV is a durable conductor after replacement of the aorto-iliac segment due to aortic infection. Further CTA studies from more centres are warranted to evaluate the risk of vein rupture.
