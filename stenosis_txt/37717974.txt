Title: Comparison of the effects of alpha lipoic acid and dexpanthenol in an experimental tracheal reconstruction animal model.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the positive effects of intraperitoneal administration of alpha-lipolic acid (ALA) and dexpanthenol (DXP) on wound healing after tracheal surgery in rats.
METHODS: The study was carried out at Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey, from January 2014-2019. A total of 30 healthy and adult Sprague-Dawley type female rats were included in the study. For the experiment, rats were randomly divided into 3 groups: ALA group (n=10), DXP group (n=10), and control group (n=10). After trachea surgery, 100 mg/kg/day ALA was given to group ALA and 100 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal DXP to group DXP for 15 days, and the rats were sacrificed on the 21st day. The excised tracheal sections were evaluated and graded for inflammatory cell infiltration, angiogenesis, fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and epithelial regeneration to evaluate wound healing.
RESULTS: Inflammation was found to be less in both the ALA and DXP groups. With the Mann-Whitney test, it was determined that inflammation was less in the ALA group than in the DXP group (C-D [p=0.097] and C-A [p=0.024]). On the other hand, no statistically significant difference was found in epithelial regeneration (p=0.574; &gt;0.05), angiogenesis (p=0.174; &gt;0.05), fibroblast proliferation, and collagen deposition (p=0.102; &gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Alpha-lipolic acid injected intravenously after tracheal reconstruction in patients can prevent restenosis by reducing inflammation without adversely affecting wound healing.
