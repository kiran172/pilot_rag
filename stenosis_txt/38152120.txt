Title: A case report of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in a patient with Sjögren's syndrome and aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The co-existence of Sjögren's syndrome and aortic stenosis (AS) is infrequent, and there lack cases of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for these patients with detailed management decision-making.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of a female patient who had AS and Sjögren's syndrome with leukopaenia and thrombocytopaenia. To overcome co-existing hyper-coagulation and high thrombogenesis risk, difficult lifetime valve management, and high infection risk, we performed TAVR with 3D printing and formulated antithrombotic and antibiotic schemes.
CONCLUSION: This case provided a successful experience of TAVR in patients with Sjögren's syndrome. Long-term follow-up will be conducted, and optimization of the therapeutic regimen requires further exploration.
