Title: Clinical Outcomes, Predictors, and Surgical Management of Primary Pulmonary Vein Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Surgical outcomes for primary pulmonary vein stenosis (PPVS) remain unfavorable, and risk factors are still poorly understood. This study evaluated outcomes and risk factors after PPVS repair.
METHODS: This retrospective study included 40 patients with PPVS who underwent surgical repair in Fuwai Hospital from 2010 to 2020. Adverse outcomes included overall death, pulmonary vein (PV) restenosis, and reintervention. A univariate and multivariate risk analysis was performed to determine risk factors.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up duration was 37.5 ± 31.5 months. Sutureless technique was performed in 7 patients (17.5%), endovenectomy in 9 (22.5%), and patch venoplasty in 24 (60%). Bilateral PV involvement was documented in 12 patients (30%). Overall death, PV reintervention, and restenosis occurred in 15%, 12.5%, and 25% of patients, respectively. Freedom from overall death, PV reintervention, and restenosis at 5 years was 85% ± 6.3%, 88.9% ± 5.2%, and 65.1% ± 13.2%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that bilateral PV involvement was an independent risk factor for death or PV reintervention (hazard ratio, 10.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.9-56; P = .006) and that involvement of the left inferior PV was an independent risk factor for postoperative restenosis of the left inferior PV (hazard ratio, 13.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-76.8; P = .004).
CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment for PPVS remains a challenging issue with imperfect prognosis. Therefore, it is right and appropriate to take close surveillance on mild or moderate stenosis on a single PV. Bilateral and left inferior PV involvement are independent risk factors for adverse outcomes.
