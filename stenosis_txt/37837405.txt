Title: Horizontal middle partial laryngectomy with cricothyroidopexy: an effective treatment for stage T1b glottic carcinoma.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The current treatment options for T1b glottic carcinoma often lead to poor treatment outcomes or voice quality.
OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the therapeutic efficacy of horizontal middle partial laryngectomy with cricothyroidopexy (HMPL-CTP) for stage T1b glottic carcinoma.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 73 patients with T1b glottic carcinoma. The patients were categorized into three groups: Group A (n = 22) underwent transoral laser microsurgery (TLMS), Group B (n = 21) received frontolateral vertical partial laryngectomy (FVPL), and Group C (n = 30) underwent HMPL-CTP. The study analyzed the 5-year overall survival rate (OS), recurrence rate, phonatory status, and incidence of laryngeal stenosis.
RESULTS: Voice quality scores varied significantly in the three groups, while the 5-year OS were similar. The local recurrence rate is higher in Group A than in the other two groups. The laryngeal stenosis rate in Group B is higher than in Groups A and C. Adhesions in the anterior commissure were observed in 18 cases in Group A and nine cases in Group C.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: HMPL-CTP demonstrates efficacy as a treatment for stage T1b glottic carcinoma, offering favorable preservation of laryngeal function and minimal complications.
