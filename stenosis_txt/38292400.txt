Title: Cardiac tamponade and basilar artery aneurysm following leptospirosis: A case report.

Abstract: Complications involving the heart are rare in leptospirosis, and cardiac tamponade is still rarer. We report the case of a 42-year-old hypertensive woman who presented with complaints of cough for 2 months and breathlessness for 1 month. One month later, she developed shortness of breath and loss of consciousness. The patient had a history of hemiparesis. Serum anti-Leptospira immunoglobulin M ELISA was positive. Ultrasound showed pericardial tamponade and hemorrhagic collection. Two-dimensional echocardiography showed minimal effusion posterior to the left ventricle and no effusion present to the right ventricle. High-resolution computerized tomography revealed patchy areas of ground glass opacities in bilateral upper and bilateral lower lobes, prominent bronchovascular markings bilaterally, and minimal pericardial thickening. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed small chronic infarcts in bilateral corona radiata and basal ganglia. A magnetic resonance angiogram of the brain showed a basilar top aneurysm, which was an incidental finding. No signs of rupture of the aneurysm were seen. Digital subtraction angiography showed 50%-70% stenosis at the junction of the V3-V4 segments of the vertebral artery. The right lower limb immobilization, along with ecosprin, ivabradine, amlodipine, and fluconazole, was started, to which the patient responded well.
