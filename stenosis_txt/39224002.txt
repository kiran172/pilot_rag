Title: First-in-human: Leaflet laceration with balloon mediated annihilation to prevent coronary obstruction with radiofrequency needle (LLAMACORN) for valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Coronary obstruction (CO) is a potential pitfall for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), especially in valve in valve procedures into degenerated surgical or transcatheter prostheses. Bioprosthetic leaflet modification techniques that incorporate electrosurgery are evolving as the preferred strategy to mitigate the risk of CO in high CO risk settings. The UNICORN method is proposed as a more predictable leaflet modification strategy than the earlier described BASILICA approach, but its proponents have hitherto mandated the use of a balloon-expandable valve (BEV) prosthesis. Many patients have small prostheses and therein face a significant risk of patient prosthesis mismatch with BEV in this setting. This risk may be curtailed if a self-expanding valve (SEV) prosthesis could be used. Herein described is a modified approach to allow for the utilization of SEV systems in this setting.
