Title: Gender Disparities after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Newer Generation Transcatheter Heart Valves: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Previous studies have demonstrated gender disparities in mortality and vascular complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) with early generation transcatheter heart valves (THVs). It is unclear, however, whether gender-related differences persist with the newer generation THVs. We aim to assess gender disparities after TAVR with newer generation THVs. The MEDLINE and Embase databases were thoroughly searched from inception to April 2023 to identify studies that reported gender-specific outcomes after TAVR with newer generation THVs (Sapien 3, Corevalve Evolut R, and Evolut Pro). The outcomes of interest included 30-day mortality, 1-year mortality, and vascular complications. In total, 5 studies (4 databases) with a total of 47,933 patients (21,073 females and 26,860 males) were included. Ninety-six percent received TAVR via the transfemoral approach. The females had higher 30-day mortality rates (odds ratio (OR) = 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31-1.79, p-value (p) &lt; 0.001) and vascular complications (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.23-1.65, p &lt; 0.001). However, one-year mortality was similar between the two groups (OR = 0.78, 95% CI 0.61-1.00, p = 0.28). The female gender continues to be associated with higher 30-day mortality rates and vascular complications after TAVR with newer generation transcatheter heart valves, while there was no difference in 1-year mortality between the genders. More data is needed to explore the causes and whether we can improve TAVR outcomes in females.
