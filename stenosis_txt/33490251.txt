Title: The Relationship between the Mean Platelet Volume and Carotid Atherosclerosis and Prognosis in Patients with Acute Cerebral Infarction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between mean platelet volume (MPV) level and carotid atherosclerosis and prognosis in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Methods. A retrospectively included 160 patients with acute cerebral infarction classified by TOAST classification as aortic atherosclerosis as the observation group. To analyze the relationship between MPV and carotid atherosclerosis, and use receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to analyze the role of MPV in predicting the prognosis of acute cerebral infarction in the observation group, grouping patients with different MPV by cut-off value, and analyze the differences in factors between the two groups of patients.
RESULTS: MPV has a positive correlation with carotid atherosclerosis in patients with acute cerebral infarction. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that increased MPV was an independent predictor of poor functional outcome in patients with acute cerebral infarction (Odds Ratio (OR): 6.152, 95% CI: 2.385-13.625, P &lt; 0.01). ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for MPV to predict poor prognosis was 0.868 (95% CI: 0.787-949, P &lt; 0.01). The cutoff value, sensitivity, and specificity were 12.65, 76.2%, and 87.6%. Compared with patients with MPV &lt; 12.65 at admission, patients with higher MPV levels (MPV â‰¥ 12.65) at admission have larger infarct size, more severe carotid artery stenosis, poor short-term prognosis, and higher mortality.
CONCLUSION: MPV level is closely related to the degree of carotid atherosclerosis in patients with acute cerebral infarction, and it is also an independent predictor of poor prognosis in patients with acute cerebral infarction at 3 months.
