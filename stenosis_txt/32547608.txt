Title: Relationship between high sensitivity C-reactive protein and angiographic severity of coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. Cytokines play a potential role in atherosclerosis pathogenesis and progression. We investigated the association between high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and severity of CAD.
METHODS: CAD patients were stratified according to hsCRP cut-off value into high levels hsCRP group (≥ 8.4 mg/L) and low levels hsCRP group (< 8.4 mg/L). Severity of CAD was assessed according to artery stenosis degree and the number of vessel involved. Statistical analysis was performed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 23.0).
RESULTS: The mean age was 60.3 ± 11.0 years. The level of hsCRP was increased and ranged from 0.2 to 1020.0 mg/L. Biochemical risk factors and severity of CAD didn't show significant differences between the two groups. In multivariate linear analysis, cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and serum amyloid A (SAA) were predictors of hsCRP. As shown in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis performed in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and compared to myonecrosis biomarkers, hsCRP (area under the curve (AUC): 0.905; 95%CI: 0.844-0.966; P &lt; 0.001) could be a powerful predictor marker in evaluating the infarct size after myocardial infarction but not better than cTnI.
CONCLUSIONS: HsCRP levels were not associated with the severity of CAD but could be useful in the evaluation of myocardial necrosis in patients with STEMI.
