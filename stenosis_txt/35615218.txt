Title: Retrograde Pulmonary Vein Recanalization Using Transcatheter Electrosurgery.

Abstract: Transcatheter electrosurgery is a wire-based technique used to traverse or cut tissue within blood-filled spaces using alternating current delivered by guidewires or catheters. The use of transcatheter electrosurgical techniques in the pediatric population has been limited. We are reporting the first case of retrograde pulmonary vein recanalization usingÂ transcatheter electrosurgery. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
