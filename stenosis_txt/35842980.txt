Title: An organic selenium and VEGF-conjugated bioinspired coating promotes vascular healing.

Abstract: The introduction of drug-eluting stents (DESs) have yield a significant reduction in the incidence of re-stenosis, however, challenges remain including incomplete healing of the endothelium, inflammatory response and thrombogenesis at the site of vascular wall injury. Here, we developed a novel stent with polyphenol-polyamine surface combining the biological functions of nitric oxide gas and VEGF, selectively promoting the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells while suppressing smooth muscle cells. Compared with bare PLLA stents and traditional DESs, the functionalized stents enhanced vascular healing through remarkable inhibiting intimal hyperplasia and occurrence of thrombosis, accelerating the in-situ endothelium repair. Moreover, it showed a down-regulation of injury vascular inflammation response and reduction of the vessel wall injury in New Zealand Rabbits after 1- and 3-month implantation.
