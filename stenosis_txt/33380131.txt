Title: [ERCP in patients after choledochodenoanastomosis].

Abstract: UNLABELLED: The aim of this retrospective study is to evaluate our experience with diagnostic and therapeutic endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreaticography (ERCP) in patients after choledochoduodenoanastomosis.
METHODS: The study took 20 years (November 1994 - December 2014). Three patients after choledochoduodenoanastomosis who had symptoms of biliary obstruction were retrospectively evaluated. In all cases, a standard therapeutic videolateroscope was used to perform ERCP.
PATIENTS AND RESULTS: We achieved ERCP in these 3 patients with choledochoduodenoanastomosis 100% cannulation success rate - 3 out of 3 patients. This was 100% success rate of diagnostic ERCP. In all of these patients, ERCP was found - both stenosis of the natural mouth of the Vater papilla, stenosis of choledochoduodenoanastomosis, and suprastenotic distal choledocholithiasis. In all patients with the above-described ERCP pathology, endoscopic treatment was initiated immediately after diagnostic ERCP, consisting of standard endoscopic papillotomy of the stenotic Vater papilla, balloon dilatation of choledochoduodenoanastomosis stenosis, and endoscopic extraction of suprastenotic distal choledocholithiasis. In total, therapeutic ERCP was completely successful in all 3 patients out of 3 (100%) who had initially started endoscopic treatment. There were no complications in our group of 3 patients.
CONCLUSION: In ERCP in patients after choledochoduodenoanastomosis, we achieved 100% success of both diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP in all of our 3 patients.
