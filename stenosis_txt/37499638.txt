Title: Tortuosity and Proximal-Specific Hemodynamics Associated with Plaque Location in the Carotid Bulb Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic plaque locations in the carotid bulb increasingly have been found to be associated with patterns of ischemic lesions and plaque progression. However, the occurrence of carotid bulb plaque is a complex process. We aimed to investigate plaque characteristics and geometric and hemodynamic parameters among patients with body and apical plaques of the carotid bulb and to identify the mechanism of bulb plaque formation and location.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with single carotid bulb stenosis (50-99%) were enrolled retrospectively. Patients were divided into body and apical plaque groups based on plaque location. Plaque location and characteristics were identified and measured on high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging. Geometric parameters were derived from time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to quantify wall shear stress (WSS) and four associated WSS-based metrics on the plaque side, on the non-plaque side, and in different parts of the lesion. Plaque characteristics and geometric and hemodynamic parameters were compared, and their associations with the plaque location were determined.
RESULTS: Seventy patients were recruited (41 body plaques and 29 apical plaques). WSSplaque values were lower than WSSnon-plaque values for all plaques (median [interquartile range], 12.59 [9.83-22.14] vs. 17.27 [11.63-27.63] Pa, p = 0.001). In a multivariate binary logistic regression, the tortuosity of the stenosed region, the magnitudes of the mean relative residence time, and the minimum transverse WSS in the proximal part of the lesion were the key factors independently associated with plaque location (p = 0.022, 0.013, and 0.012, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Plaque formation was associated with the local flow pattern, and the tortuosity and proximal-specific hemodynamics were significantly associated with plaque location in the carotid bulb.
