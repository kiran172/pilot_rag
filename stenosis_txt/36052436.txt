Title: Transcatheter Closure of a Paravalvular Leak After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement With 3-Dimensional Printing Guidance: A Case Report.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Our goal was to report the transcatheter closure of a paravalvular leak after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) using 3-dimensional (3D) printing.
CASE REPORT: A 66-year-old man who had undergone transapical and TAVR 2 years ago due to aortic regurgitation, presented with palpitations and shortness of breath owing to exacerbation of paravalvular regurgitation. Echocardiography suggested that the stented aortic valve was fixed securely in place and the valve leaflets moved normally after TAVR, but there was severe paravalvular regurgitation (3 bundles, volume 11.0 mL). Due to the high surgical risk, we closed the transcatheter paravalvular leak using preprocedural guidance with 3D printing and intraprocedural guidance with digital subtraction angiography. Postoperative echocardiography showed that the paravalvular leak was significantly reduced. 3D construction showed that the occluders and the stent valve were well placed.
CONCLUSION: Transcatheter closure of a paravalvular leak of the aortic valve may be feasible with appropriate pre- and intraoperative 3D printing guidance.
CLINICAL IMPACT: 3D printing technology may help surgeons to make accurate preoperative strategy before occlusion procedures.
