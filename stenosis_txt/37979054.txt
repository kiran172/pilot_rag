Title: MFG-E8 Alleviates Cognitive Impairments Induced by Chronic Cerebral Hypoperfusion by Phagocytosing Myelin Debris and Promoting Remyelination.

Abstract: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion is one of the pathophysiological mechanisms contributing to cognitive decline by causing white matter injury. Microglia phagocytosing myelin debris in a timely manner can promote remyelination and contribute to the repair of white matter. However, milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor-factor 8 (MFG-E8), a microglial phagocytosis-related protein, has not been well studied in hypoperfusion-related cognitive dysfunction. We found that the expression of MFG-E8 was significantly decreased in the brain of mice after bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS). MFG-E8 knockout mice demonstrated more severe BCAS-induced cognitive impairments in the behavioral tests. In addition, we discovered that the deletion of MFG-E8 aggravated white matter damage and the destruction of myelin microstructure through fluorescent staining and electron microscopy. Meanwhile, MFG-E8 overexpression by AAV improved white matter injury and increased the number of mature oligodendrocytes after BCAS. Moreover, in vitro and in vivo experiments showed that MFG-E8 could enhance the phagocytic function of microglia via the α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>3</sub>/α<sub>V</sub>β<sub>5</sub>/Rac1 pathway and IGF-1 production to promote the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells into mature oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, we found that MFG-E8 was mainly derived from astrocytes, not microglia. Our findings suggest that MFG-E8 is a potential therapeutic target for cognitive impairments following cerebral hypoperfusion.
