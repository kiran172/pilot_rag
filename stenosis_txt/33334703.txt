Title: Systemic steroids have a role in treating esophageal strictures in pediatric eosinophilic esophagitis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The role of systemic steroids in the treatment of esophageal strictures in children with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is poorly defined.
AIMS: To describe a cohort of children with EoE-associated esophageal strictures responding to systemic steroids.
METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of children with EoE and moderate (<9 mm) to severe (<6 mm) strictures, who responded clinically and endoscopically to systemic steroids.
RESULTS: Twenty children (median age 10.6 ± 4.2 years; 17 males) from nine centers in six countries were included in the analysis; 16 had moderate and four, severe strictures; 18 had dysphagia or bolus impaction; median diagnostic delay was 8 months (IQR 3.5-35). Eighteen patients received oral systemic steroids (mean dose 1.4 mg/kg/day) for a median of 4 weeks, while two initially received IV steroids. All patients showed clinical improvement and 15/20 became asymptomatic. Stricture resolution at endoscopy was found in 19/20, while histological resolution of EoE (<15 eos/hpf) in 13/20. Only minor side effects were reported: hyperphagia (10/20); weight gain (5/20); hyperactivity (2/20) and acne (1/20). Esophageal dilation was required in 3/20 patients during a median follow-up of 48.5 months (IQR 26.7-73.2).
CONCLUSION: Children with EoE and esophageal strictures, may benefit from the use of a short course of systemic steroids, avoiding mechanical dilation.
