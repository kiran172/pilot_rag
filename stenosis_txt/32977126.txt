Title: Palliative combined cutting and high-pressure balloon valvuloplasty in six dogs with severe, symptomatic subaortic stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVES: Severe subaortic stenosis (SAS) is a congenital heart defect in dogs that often results in clinical signs and reduced survival. The objective of this study was to describe characteristics of dogs with severe, symptomatic SAS who underwent combined cutting and high-pressure balloon valvuloplasty (CB/HPBV).
ANIMALS, MATERIALS, AND METHODS: Retrospective description of the clinical characteristics, CB/HPBV procedural deviations from reported methodology and outcomes in a series of six client-owned dogs with severe, symptomatic SAS.
RESULTS: Breeds included two each of Newfoundland, Golden retriever, and German shepherd. Median age was 10.1 months (range: 5-72.3 months), and median weight was 25.5 kg (range: 21.8-36.4 kg). Before CB/HPBV, clinical signs were present in all dogs; four were managed for congestive heart failure (CHF). Three dogs had concurrent congenital heart disease. Median Doppler-estimated left ventricular outflow tract pressure gradient was pre-operatively 149.7 mmHg (range: 89.9-254.7 mmHg) and post-operatively 134.1 mmHg (range: 83.9-181.2 mmHg). Median aortoseptal angle was steep at 136° (range: 109-143°). Clinical improvement was documented in all dogs, based on temporary discontinuation of diuretics and/or owner-perceived reduction in clinical signs. At the time of writing, three dogs had died suddenly, one was euthanized because of recurrence of clinical signs, and one died in CHF. Median survival time was 26.4 months after procedure (range: 6.3-45.8 months). One dog remained alive at 44 months after procedure.
CONCLUSIONS: Palliative CB/HPBV is a potential therapeutic option for dogs with severe, symptomatic SAS complicated by concurrent congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, or CHF.
