Title: Improved regional myocardial blood flow and flow reserve after coronary revascularization as assessed by serial 15O-water positron emission tomography/computed tomography.

Abstract: AIMS: Myocardial perfusion imaging without and with quantitative myocardial blood flow (MBF) and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) plays an important role in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). We aimed to quantify the effects of coronary revascularization on regional stress MBF and MFR and to determine whether the presence of subendocardial infarction was associated with these changes.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Forty-seven patients with stable CAD were prospectively enrolled. They underwent 15O-water positron emission tomography at baseline and 6 months after optimal medical therapy alone (n = 16), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (n = 18), or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) (n = 13). Stenosis of ≥50% diameter was detected in 98/141 vessels (70%). The regional MFR was significantly increased from baseline to follow-up [1.84 (interquartile range, IQR 1.28-2.17) vs. 2.12 (IQR 1.69-2.63), P < 0.001] in vessel territories following PCI or CABG due to an increase in the stress MBF [1.33 (IQR 0.97-1.67) mL/g/min vs. 1.64 (IQR 1.38-2.17) mL/g/min, P < 0.001], whereas there was no significant change in the regional stress MBF or MFR in vessel territories without revascularization. A multilevel mixed-effects models adjusted for baseline characteristics, subendocardial infarction assessed by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging, and intra-patient correlation showed that the degree of angiographic improvement after coronary revascularization was significantly associated with increased regional stress MBF and MFR (P < 0.05 for all).
CONCLUSION: Coronary revascularization improved the regional stress MBF and MFR in patients with stable CAD. The magnitude of these changes was associated with the extent of revascularization independent of subendocardial infarction.
