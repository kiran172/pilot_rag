Title: Fasciocutaneous foreskin twin flaps in hypospadias repair: Reconstructing a functional penis with freestyle design.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Hypospadias is the most common congenital urological deformity in males; however, there is still no perfect solution or surgical method for one-stage operations to fix proximal hypospadias with ventral penile curvature (VPC). We developed a fasciocutaneous foreskin twin flap technique that can provide freestyle flap designs in hypospadias repair.
METHODS: A retrospective study including 26 patients was performed between January 2017 and June 2020. The surgical procedures included VPC correction, skin flap design, transfer and reconstruction. The urethra and shaft were reconstructed by twin flaps in one stage. All patients were followed up until 12 months.
RESULTS: All VPC cases were corrected after the operation. The fistula rate was 11.5% (3/26). No meatal stenosis, urethral diverticulum, or stricture was observed. A total of 92.3% (24/26) of patients were satisfied with their penis appearance.
CONCLUSIONS: The fasciocutaneous foreskin twin flaps provide freestyle designs in hypospadias repair, which can achieve a one-stage operation for proximal hypospadias with low fistula rates.
