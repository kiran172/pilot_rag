Title: Prognostic impact of muscle ultrasound-guided diagnosis of sarcopenia in older adults with severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Muscle ultrasound is increasingly popular thanks to its advantages over other techniques. However, its usefulness in the diagnosis of sarcopenia in older adults with aortic stenosis (AS) has not been studied to date.
OBJECTIVES: to analyze the prevalence of sarcopenia using muscle ultrasound and its impact on the health outcomes in older patients with AS.
METHODS: The single-center FRESAS (FRailty-Evaluation-in-Severe-Aortic-Stenosis) registry was used to study patients over 75 years with severe AS susceptible to valve replacement. Sarcopenia was suspected in those individuals with diminished grip strength, and the diagnosis was confirmed in the presence of reduced ultrasound quadriceps muscle thickness, following the recommendations of the EWGSOP2 (European-Working-Group-on-Sarcopenia-in-Older-People). The primary composite endpoint was urgent hospital admission and mortality of cardiac cause 6 months after the diagnosis.
RESULTS: Of the 150 patients studied, 55.3% were females, and only 17.3% were frail; the mean age was 83.4 years. Sarcopenia was diagnosed in 42 patients (28%). The overall survival rate at 6 months was 92%. The primary endpoint was recorded in 23.2% of the cases and was more frequent in the sarcopenic patients (33.3%) than in the non-sarcopenic individuals (17.6%) (p = 0.01). The regression analysis found that sarcopenia was associated with an increased risk of the primary endpoint (HR: 2.25; 95% CI 1.19-4.45; p = 0.02), adjusting for potential confounding factors.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of serious cardiac complications in older patients with sarcopenia and severe AS is significant. The present study describes a noninvasive, ultrasound-guided diagnostic technique that may prove efficient in its predictive capacity.
