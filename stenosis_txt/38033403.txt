Title: Clinical valve thrombosis and arterial embolism in a cancer patient after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: The number of cancer patients with severe aortic stenosis and atrial fibrillation (AF) is increasing in the aging population. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established treatment option for severe aortic stenosis with high surgical risk, including individuals with cancer. Antithrombotic therapy should be considered for post-TAVR or AF patients. However, antithrombotic management in cancer patients remains challenging due to the increased risk of both thromboembolism and bleeding. We present a case of clinical valve thrombosis and arterial embolism after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in an elderly patient with a history of metastatic pancreatic cancer and permanent atrial fibrillation under treatment of single antiplatelet therapy. Warfarin treatment after successful surgical thrombectomy to the occluded arteries improved clinical valve thrombosis, although the long-term outcome remains unclear. This case demonstrates that novel management algorithms for thromboembolism and bleeding in elderly cancer patients with AF and valvular heart disease are urgently needed.
