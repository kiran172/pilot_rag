Title: Declined plasma microfibrillar-associated protein 4 levels in acute coronary syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Microfibrillar-associated protein (MFAP4), initially identified as an extracellular matrix protein, has been demonstrated in multiple human disorders, but it is yet to be discovered following acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in clinical practice. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the relationship between circulating MFAP4 levels and coronary stenosis in ACS.
METHODS: We performed the study in 148 ACS subjects, including 75 ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), 27 non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (non-STEMI) and 46 unstable angina (UA). Clinical variables were collected and Gensini and Syntax stenosis scoring systems were applied to assess the severity of coronary stenosis. Kaplan-Meier and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the relationship between MFAP4 and the severity of coronary stenosis or ACS outcomes. Spearman analysis was used to describe the correlation between MFAP4 and clinical parameters.
RESULTS: Circulating MFAP4 levels were significantly decreased in the STEMI group (0.008 ng/ml) compared with the non-STEMI group (0.014 ng/ml) and UA group (0.019 ng/ml) (p < 0.001). After adjusting for confounding factors, we found that MFAP4 was an independent risk factor for STEMI (odds ratio = 0.395, 95% CI 0.174-0.895, p = 0.026). MFAP4 level was negatively correlated with Gensini score and Syntax score (r = - 0.311 and - 0.211, p < 0.001 and 0.01, respectively). Based on the MFAP4 level of 0.117 ng/ml, ACS patients were divided into two groups: the low-MFAP4 group (< 0.117 ng/ml, n = 60) and the high-MFAP4 group (≥ 0.117 ng/ml, n = 88). After the median follow-up of 165 days, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that the MACE-free rate was significantly lower in ACS patients with lower MFAP4 levels (p = 0.009).
CONCLUSIONS: MFAP4 has a potential as a biomarker for the degree of coronary stenosis in ACS. Confirmation of observations in larger cohorts and longer follow-up periods is warranted.
