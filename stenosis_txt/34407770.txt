Title: The therapeutic effects of excimer laser coronary atherectomy therapy for in-stent restenosis chronic total occlusions.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of excimer laser coronary atherectomy (ELCA) in patients with in-stent restenosis chronic total occlusions (ISR CTOs).
BACKGROUND: ISR CTOs are a challenge in percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Although they can be treated by ELCA, limited data are available on the effects of ELCA treatment in these patients.
METHODS: Fifty-nine consecutive patients underwent PCI for ISR CTOs at Beijing Hospital between December 2017 and September 2020. According to whether or not ELCA was performed, they were divided into two groups. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analyses were performed routinely, including measurement of the minimal lumen diameter and calculation of the percentage diameter stenosis. The procedural success rate, the frequency of peri-procedural complications, and the incidence rates of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) over nine months were assessed. The primary endpoint in the study was the percentage diameter stenosis.
RESULTS: Procedure success was achieved in most patients in both groups (75.9%). Patients in the ELCA group exhibited a lower percentage diameter stenosis (24.5 ± 9.09 vs. 35.1 ± 18.6, p = 0.048) and a larger minimal lumen diameter (2.36 ± 0.29 mm vs. 1.78 ± 0.64 mm, p < 0.001) than those in the control group and the 9-month incidence rates of MACEs did not differ (9.5% vs 15.8%, p = 0.699).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that ELCA may be a safe and effective technique in the treatment of ISR CTOs, and the use of ELCA can achieve good immediate angiographic results, as measured by QCA, without increasing peri-procedural complications or the incidence rates of 9-month MACEs.
