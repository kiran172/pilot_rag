Title: Diagnostic efficacy of tract-specific diffusion tensor imaging in cervical spondylotic myelopathy with electrophysiological examination validation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of tract-specific diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) metrics in identifying the responsible segments for neurological dysfunction in cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).
METHODS: The study encompassed nineteen participants diagnosed with CSM, including 10 males and 9 females. Additionally, a control group consisting of ten healthy caregivers (5 males and 5 females) were recruited with no symptoms and no compressions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All participants underwent a comprehensive physical examination, MRI assessment, and DTI examination conducted by a senior chief physician. Several parameters were collected from the MR images, including the aspect ratio (defined as the anteroposterior diameter / the transverse diameter of the corresponding segment's spinal cord), transverse ratio (defined as the transverse diameter of the corresponding segment's spinal cord / the transverse diameter of the spinal cord at C2/3), and T2 high signal of the spinal cord. Furthermore, quantitative DTI metrics, such as axial diffusivity (AD), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD), and fractional anisotropy (FA), were calculated using automatic region-of-interest (ROI) analysis for both whole spinal cord column and dorsal column. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the aspect ratio, transverse ratio, and DTI parameters. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were calculated. Intraoperative spinal cord electrophysiological examination was performed as the objective measure of spinal cord function during surgery.
RESULTS: As determined by electrophysiological examination, neurological dysfunction was found in 2 patients due to C3/4 compression, in 10 patients due to C4/5 compression, in 6 patients due to C5/6 compression, and in 1 patient due to C6/7 compression. The modified Japanese Orthopedic Association scale (mJOA) was 12.71 ± 1.55 in the CSM group, with 4.87 ± 0.72 for sensory nerve function and 5.05 ± 1.35 for motor nerve function. For the control group, none of the volunteers had neurological dysfunction. T2 high signal was found at the most stenotic segment in 13 patients of the CSM group. Considering all the cervical segments, the aspect ratio (AUC = 0.823, P = 0.001, Sensitivity = 68.42%, Specificity = 82.47%) was more capable of determining the responsible segment than transverse ratio (AUC = 0.661, P = 0.027, Sensitivity = 68.42%, Specificity = 67.01%). AD, MD, and RD were significantly higher while FA was significantly lower in the responsible segment than in the irresponsible segment (P < 0.05). The AUC of DTI-Dorsal column parameters (AD, MD, RD, FA) was larger than the corresponding parameters of the DTI (Whole spinal cord). AD of DTI-Dorsal Column possessed the greatest efficacy (AUC = 0.823, sensitivity = 84.21%, specificity = 77.32%) to determine the responsible segment, larger than AD of DTI-Whole spinal cord (AUC = 0.822, P = 0.001, Sensitivity = 89.47%, Specificity = 77.32%), aspect ratio (AUC = 0.823, P = 0.001, Sensitivity = 68.42%, Specificity = 82.47%) and transverse ratio (AUC = 0.661, P = 0.027, Sensitivity = 68.42%, Specificity = 67.01%). Subgroup analysis revealed that the diagnostic efficacy of DTI and MRI parameters was influenced by cervical spine segment.
CONCLUSIONS: When considering all cervical segments, AD from the DTI-Dorsal Column exhibited the most significant potential in identifying responsible segments. This potential was found to be superior to that of DTI-Whole spinal cord, aspect ratio, the most stenotic segment, T2 high signals, transverse ratio, motor nerve dysfunction, and sensory nerve dysfunction. The diagnostic effectiveness of both DTI and MRI parameters was notably influenced by the specific cervical spine segment.
