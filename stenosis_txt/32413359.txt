Title: A Novel Computed Tomography Scan Tool for Patient Selection in Minithoracotomy Aortic Replacement.

Abstract: Right anterior minithoracotomy is gaining larger acceptance for isolated aortic valve replacement. In some patients, however, surgical exposure during the intervention may be challenging even for experienced surgeons or centers. In our opinion, proper preoperative selection of the patients by computed tomography scan seems mandatory. We routinely perform right anterior minithoracotomy, and over time, we have found that the angle between the right border of the sternum and the left side of the aorta, at the level of the pulmonary artery, helps with patient selection.
