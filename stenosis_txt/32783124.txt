Title: Totally Mechanical Collard Technique for Cervical Esophagogastric Anastomosis Reduces Stricture Formation Compared with Circular Stapled Anastomosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal technique for cervical esophagogastric anastomosis in esophagectomy has not yet been established. Using circular stapled (CS) technique effectively reduces the incidence of anastomotic leakage and shortens the operating time; however, anastomotic stricture has been reported to be more common. The present study was performed to compare the clinical outcomes of the recently developed totally mechanical Collard (TMC) and CS anastomosis.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed consecutive esophageal cancer cases who are undergoing transthoracic extended esophagectomy with gastric conduit reconstruction using cervical CS or TMC anastomosis from December 2013 to December 2016. Propensity score matching and multivariate regression were used to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics.
RESULTS: Among 313 patients, 93 underwent CS anastomosis and 220 underwent TMC anastomosis. Stricture formation occurred in 59 patients (18.8%), significantly more often with the CS than TMC anastomosis (30.1% vs. 14.1%, p = 0.001). No significant differences were observed in the refractory stricture rate (9.7% vs. 5.0%, p = 0.134) or the anastomotic leakage rate (11.8% vs. 10.9%, p = 0.845) between the two groups. The propensity score matching cohort study including 86 pairs of patients confirmed a significantly lower stricture formation rate with the TMC than CS technique (27.9% vs. 14.0%, p = 0.038). In the multivariable analysis, anastomotic leakage, the CS technique, and a body mass index of ≥25 mg/m2 were independently associated with a risk of stricture formation.
CONCLUSION: TMC technique contributed to a reduced rate of stricture formation compared with CS technique in cervical esophagogastric anastomosis.
