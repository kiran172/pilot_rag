Title: Upregulation of long non-coding RNA myocardial infarction-associated transcription is correlated with coronary artery stenosis and elevated inflammation in patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease.

Abstract: Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease (CAD) is a chronic disease caused by multiple risk factors. Aberrant expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been regarded as an independent risk factor of CAD. This study evaluated lncRNA myocardial infarction-associated transcription (MIAT) expression in CAD patients and its clinical significance. Totally, 155 CAD patients and 76 non-CAD controls were enrolled. MIAT expression was detected using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The clinical diagnostic significance of MIAT was evaluated by plotting the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The levels of inflammatory cytokines were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. microRNA (miR)-29b-3p expression and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPPA) level were detected. MIAT expression in CAD patients (4.23 [1.22-6.50]) was higher than that in non-CAD controls (1.64 [0.05-2.93]) (p < 0.01) and had an independent correlation with CAD. The area under ROC curve of predicting CAD was calculated as 0.790, the specificity as 71.40%, and the sensitivity as 70.00%. MIAT expression was positively correlated with the C-reactive protein level (r = 0.769, p < 0.0001) and pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and IL-8 levels, while negatively correlated with the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. MIAT was positively correlated with Gensini score and had an independent correlation with it. LncRNA MIAT sponged miR-29b-3p and miR-29b-3p targeted PAPPA. In conclusion, lncRNA MIAT was upregulated in the peripheral blood of CAD patients and elicited clinical diagnostic significance. MIAT participated in the development of CAD via miR-29b-3p/PAPPA axis. This study provides insights into a potential target for the diagnosis and treatment of CAD.
