Title: Pulmonary Venous Flow After Lung Transplantation: Turbulence and High Velocities.

Abstract: Lung transplantation is the definitive treatment for end-stage lung disease. The pulmonary venous anastomosis has the potential for significant obstructive complications that can lead to considerable morbidity and mortality. The use of intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography, including color-flow and spectral Doppler, is instrumental in evaluating the pulmonary veins after lung transplantation. In this E-challenge, a case of intraoperative pulmonary venous obstruction after bilateral lung transplantation is described, the echocardiographic principles required to evaluate the pulmonary veins and screen for complications are reviewed, and when intervention may be required is discussed.
