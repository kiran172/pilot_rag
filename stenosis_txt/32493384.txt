Title: Global longitudinal strain is associated with better outcomes in transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Parameters that mark the timing of left ventricular (LV) reverse remodeling following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are incompletely defined. This study aims to identify the dynamics of LV strain derived from speckle tracking echocardiography in a cohort of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent TAVR and its correlation with postprocedural outcomes.
METHODS: We selected 150 consecutive patients (82 ± 4 years old, STS score 6.4 ± 6.2) who underwent transfemoral TAVR between 07/2016 and 12/2017 at our tertiary care center. All patients were evaluated at baseline, 1 week after TAVR, and 3 months following TAVR.
RESULTS: The global longitudinal strain (GLS) 1 week following TAVR was comparable to that at baseline (- 15,9 ± 4.3 vs - 16.8 ± 4.1; p = NS) but significantly improved at 3 months following TAVR (- 15.9 ± 4.3% vs. -19.5 ± 3.5%; p < 0.001). No significant changes in global circumferential strain (GCS) and global radial strain (GRS) were detectable. The ejection fraction was significantly improved 1 week after the TAVR procedure. The baseline GLS correlated directly with the complication rate (R = 0.36, p = 0.005). The linear regression analysis showed that the main predictors of the improvement in the GLS at 3 months in our cohort were baseline GRS and GCS.
CONCLUSION: GLS improves at 3 months after TAVR, while LV ejection fraction does not show a substantial change, signaling an early recovery of LV longitudinal function after the intervention. Additionally, GLS has a direct correlation with the postprocedural outcomes. GLS improvement might emerge as a valuable parameter for a tailored follow-up in TAVR patients.
