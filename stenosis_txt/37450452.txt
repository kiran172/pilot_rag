Title: Long-Term Observational Study of the Isolated Ostial Diagonal Stenosis in Patients with Chronic Coronary Syndrome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Isolated ostial diagonal stenoses are very rare lesions in which percutaneous intervention could cause signiﬁcant vessel compromise, and the long-term results have been reported in a few studies. This study sought the characteristics and long-term follow-up of the patients with isolated osteal diagonal stenosis regarding percutaneous coronary intervention and presence of angina.
METHODS: The study was an observational retrospective study conducted between January 2014 and December 2020. A total of 9769 patients who underwent coronary angiography were analyzed, and 87 patients had isolated diagonal stenosis. The patients were evaluated according to treatment modality and angina severity in long-term pattern.
RESULTS: Median follow-up time was 36 months. A total of 54 (83.1%) patients were followed up with only medical treatment, and 11 (16.9%) patients underwent revascularization in addition to medical treatment. The degree of stenosis of the diagonal artery was signiﬁcantly higher in the percutaneous coronary intervention group than medical group (P = 0.002) and the patients with wider reference diameter of diagonal artery complaint of more angina (P = 0.007). Class I angina was signiﬁcantly higher in percutaneous coronary intervention group than medical and the patients with no angina were signiﬁcantly higher in medical group than percutaneous coronary intervention group.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous coronary intervention was mainly performed for diagonal arteries with a higher degree of stenosis; however, the patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention had angina more than 50% rates. Furthermore, the patients with ongoing angina had a larger diameter of the diagonal artery regardless of the type of treatment.
