Title: Risk factors for fistula recurrence after urethrocutaneous fistulectomy in children with hypospadias.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the risk factors of fistula recurrence after primary urethrocutaneous fistulectomy in children with hypospadias.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 63 children who underwent fistulectomy for urethrocutaneous fistula (UCFs) that occurred after urethroplasty for hypospadias, between February 2009 and December 2018. The patients were divided into 2 groups: successful group 1 and failed group 2. For data analysis, we included the demographics of the patients, the details of the previous urethroplasty (the type of hypospadias and the location of the meatus after complete chordectomy), the presence of meatal stenosis or urethral stricture after urethroplasty, and the size of the UCFs. The Student t-test and the chi-square test were performed to analyze the data using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software.
RESULTS: The overall success rate of primary urethrocutaneous fistulectomy was 81.0% (51/63 children). The most common location of a secondary fistula was the penoscrotal area 5 (41.6%). There were no statistically significant differences in age (p=0.501), weight (p=0.063), body mass index (p=0.924), history of low birth weight (p=0.454), and history of prematurity (p=0.381). The type of hypospadias (p=0.007) and urethral defect length (p=0.021) were identified as independent risk factors for failed urethrocutaneous fistulectomy. There were no statistically significant differences in meatal stenosis (p=0.431), postoperative stricture (p=0.587), fistula location (p=0.173), multiplicity (p=0.588), and fistula size (p=0.530).
CONCLUSION: The type of hypospadias and the length of the urethral defect are the significant risk factors for secondary fistula recurrence after primary urethrocutaneous fistulectomy.
