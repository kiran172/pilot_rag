Title: Safety and efficacy of everolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold for cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CART).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is still the main drawback of heart transplantation (HTx) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is a palliative measure because of the high incidence of failure.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of bioresorbable scaffolds (BRSs) as potential novel therapeutic tool for the treatment of coronary stenoses in CAV.
METHODS: This is a multicenter, single-arm, prospective, open-label study (CART, NCT02377648), that included patients affected by advanced CAV treated with PCI and second-generation ABSORB BRS (Abbott Vascular). The primary endpoint was the incidence of 12-month angiographic in-segment scaffold restenosis (ISSR). Secondary endpoints were the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) at 12- and 36-month follow-up and the incidence of ISSR at 36 months. A paired intracoronary imaging analysis at baseline and follow-up was also performed.
RESULTS: Between 2015 and 2017 35 HTx patients were enrolled and treated for 44 coronary lesions with 51 BRSs. The primary endpoint occurred in 13.5% of the lesions (5/37), with a cumulative ISSR rate up to 3 years of 16.2% (6/37). Angiographic lumen loss was 0.40 ± 0.62 mm at 12 months and 0.53 ± 0.57 mm at 36 months. Overall survival rate was 91.4% and 74.3%, and MACEs incidence 14.2% and 31.4% at 12 and 36 months, respectively. At the paired intracoronary imaging analysis, a significant increase of the vessel external elastic membrane area in the treated segment and some progression of CAV proximally to the BRS were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: BRS-based PCI for the treatment of CAV is feasible and safe, with an ISSR incidence similar to what reported in retrospective studies with drug-eluting stents.
