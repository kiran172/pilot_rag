Title: Diagnostic utility of 3D MRI sequences in the assessment of central, recess and foraminal stenoses of the spine: a systematic review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To perform a systematic literature review on the diagnostic utility of 3D MRI sequences in the assessment of central canal, recess and foraminal stenosis in the spine.
METHODS: The databases PubMed, MEDLINE (via OVID) and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, were searched for studies that investigated the diagnostic use of 3D MRI to evaluate stenoses in various parts of the spine in humans. Three reviewers examined the literature and conducted systematic review according to PRISMA 2020 guidelines.
RESULTS: Thirty studies were retrieved from 2 595 publications for this systematic review. The overall diagnostic performance of 3D MRI outperformed the conventional 2D MRI with reported sensitivities ranging from 79 to 100% and specificities ranging from 86 to 100% regarding the evaluation of central, recess and foraminal stenoses. In general, high level of agreement (both intra- and interrater) regarding visibility and pathology on 3D sequences was reported. Studies show that well-optimized 3D sequences allow the use of higher spatial resolution, similar scan time and increased SNR and CNR when compared to corresponding 2D sequences. However, the benefit of 3D sequences is in the additional information provided by them and in the possibility to save total protocol scan times.
CONCLUSION: The literature on the spine 3D MRI assessment of stenoses is heterogeneous with varying MRI protocols and diagnostic results. However, the 3D sequences offer similar or superior detection of stenoses with high reliability. Especially, the advantage of 3D MRI seems to be the better evaluation of recess stenoses.
