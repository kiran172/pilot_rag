Title: Clinical Practice Report of Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound in Renal Artery Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of renal artery contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with modified inspection section and summarize subsequent changes in imaging assessment of renal artery disease.
METHODS: A total of 1015 patients underwent renal artery CEUS were included in the study. Among them, 79 patients (156 renal arteries) suspected with renal artery stenosis (RAS) underwent digital subtraction angiography (DSA) subsequently. DSA was used as the gold standard to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CEUS in detecting RAS (≥30%) and severe stenosis (≥70%), as well as the diagnostic accuracy of classification of stenosis degree. Besides, 127 of the 1015 patients underwent other imaging examinations such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) after CEUS and annual proportion of these imaging examinations was assessed.
RESULTS: The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CEUS for detecting RAS (≥30%) was 96.4%, 88.6%, 94.2%, 95.6% and 90.7%, respectively and the kappa value was .857 (P < .01). CEUS had a good performance in distinguishing severe stenosis (≥70%) with a sensitivity of 91.1%, specificity of 95.5%, accuracy of 92.9%, PPV of 96.5%, NPV of 88.7% and the kappa value was 0.857(P < .01). There was no significant difference between CEUS and DSA in detecting stenosis (P = 1.0) and severe stenosis (P = .227). The diagnostic accuracy of CEUS in grading RAS was 85.3% and the kappa value was 0.753 (P < .01). Besides, the annual proportion of other imaging examinations decreased for 4 consecutive years.
CONCLUSIONS: CEUS is a non-invasive, safe and valuable technique for the assessment of renal artery disease and worthy of promotion.
