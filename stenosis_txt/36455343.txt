Title: Abnormally elevated EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 enhances osteogenesis in aortic valve interstitial cells by inhibiting SOCS3 expression.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The osteogenic transition of aortic valve interstitial cells (AVICs) plays a critical role for the progression of calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD). Enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) is an important methyltransferase for histone H3 Lys27 (H3K27) that has been found to be involved in osteogenesis. Here, we investigated the effect and mechanism of EZH2 in CAVD progression.
METHODS: High throughout mRNA sequencing, qRT-PCR and immunoblot were performed to screen differentially expressed genes in non-CAVD and CAVD aortic valves. To investigate the role of EZH2 and SOCS3 in osteogenesis, AVICs were treated with siRNA, adenovirus and specific inhibitors, then osteogenic markers and mineralized deposits were examined. In vivo, the morphology and function of aortic valves were investigated by HE stain and echocardiography in ApoE-/- mice fed a long-term western diet (WD).
RESULTS: We discovered that EZH2 was upregulated and SOCS3 was downregulated in calcified aortic valves. In AVICs, inhibition or silencing of EZH2 attenuated the osteogenic responses. On the other hand, demethylases inhibitor (GSK-J4) enhanced osteogenic transition of AVICs. Moreover, SOCS3 knockdown enhanced the expression of osteogenic markers, while SOCS3 overexpression suppressed osteogenesis and calcification. The chromatin immunoprecipitation and restored experiments indicated that EZH2 directly targeted SOCS3 to promote osteogenic responses of AVICs. In vivo, treatment with EZH2 inhibitor through intraperitoneal injection attenuated aortic valve thickening, calcification and dysfunction induced by WD.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we found that EZH2-mediated H3K27me3 enhanced osteogenesis and microcalcification of AVICs via inhibiting SOCS3 expression, which provides potential targets for future therapeutic interventions of CAVD.
