Title: Watershed cerebral infarction in a patient with a persistent primitive trigeminal artery and contralateral internal carotid artery stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Patients with a persistent primitive trigeminal artery frequently have a poorly developed vertebrobasilar arterial system. However, they are not at higher risk of stroke and most are asymptomatic. Left cerebral watershed infarction was identified in a 75-year-old man who presented with aphasia and disorientation on magnetic resonance image (MRI). Additional imaging studies also demonstrated a right persistent primitive trigeminal artery, aplastic basilar artery, and 47% left internal carotid artery stenosis. Antiplatelet medication was administered and he was discharged 2 weeks after admission on aspirin. At the 4-month follow-up, cerebral blood flow in the left watershed territory was still decreased; however, no recurrent stroke had occurred. Although the indication for surgical or endovascular intervention for internal carotid artery stenosis is primarily determined by the degree of stenosis, cerebral blood flow evaluation is recommended in patients with internal carotid artery stenosis and a persistent primitive trigeminal artery.
