Title: Lumen-apposing metal stent for malignant gastrointestinal stricture.

Abstract: We present a case of gastro-jejunal anastomotic stenosis due to the progression of malignant disease, successfully treated endoscopically by placing a lumen-apposing metal stent. This case illustrating the successful use of a lumen-apposing metal stent in a complex clinical scenario. This approach can significantly improve patient outcomes, especially in those who are poor surgical candidates or have advanced disease.
