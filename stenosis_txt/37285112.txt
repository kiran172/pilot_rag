Title: A case of recurring perioperative circulatory arrest: mind the autonomic nervous system.

Abstract: We report the case of an elderly woman who developed recurring episodes of unexplained cardiocirculatory arrest. The index event appeared during surgery to fix a fracture of the ankle and consisted of bradypnea, hypotension and asystole, coherent with a Bezold-Jarisch-like cardioprotective reflex. Classical signs of acute myocardial infarction were absent. Yet, occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA) was observed and successfully revascularized, whereupon circulatory arrests vanished. We discuss several differential diagnoses. Unexplainable circulatory failure, with sinus bradycardia and arterial hypotension, despite lack of ECG signs of ischemia or significant troponin levels, suggest the action of cardioprotective reflexes of the autonomic nervous system. Coronary artery disease is a common source. Attention to cardioprotective reflexes should be taken in the case of unexplained cardiac arrest without overt reasons. We recommend performing coronary angiography to exclude significant coronary stenosis.
