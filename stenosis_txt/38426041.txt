Title: Prognostic factors of MINOCA and their possible mechanisms.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Despite not showing substantial stenosis of coronary arteries, Myocardial Infarction with Non-Obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA) presents with myocardial ischemia injury, thus having a grave prognosis and a high risk of long-term complications. This necessitates increased clinical attention and exploration of its root causes to prevent a similar crisis.
METHODS: Research on MINOCA is limited, especially in terms of its clinical attributes, long-term outlook, risk stratification, and prognosis-linked cardiometabolic risk factors. This review aims to fill these gaps, providing an extensive overview of clinical trials and studies on MINOCA to separate the issue from the presence of non-obstructive coronary arteries in cardiac patients.
RESULTS: It has been found that MINOCA patients still face a high risk of long-term adverse events. Due to social and physiological factors, the hospital mortality rate is higher among women, and they are also more susceptible to MINOCA. Cardiac metabolic risk factors, including disorder of glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as changes in serum CysC levels, have significant impacts on the occurrence and prognosis of MINOCA.
CONCLUSIONS: Further research is still needed to fully understand the complex biological mechanisms underlying the prognostic factors of MINOCA. A profound understanding of these factors could reveal potential targets for improving prognosis, thereby indicating new strategies for managing this cardiovascular condition.
