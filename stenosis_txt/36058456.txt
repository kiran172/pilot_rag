Title: Hybrid Revascularization for Extensive Iliofemoral Occlusive Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Total occlusion of the iliac-femoral tract can cause a variety of life-limiting symptoms ranging from mild claudication to chronic limb-threatening ischemia. Efforts should be made to revascularize the symptomatic ischemic limb. Currently there are different options in the vascular surgeon's armamentarium to achieve this. The aim of the study was to verify the feasibility and outcomes of inflow hybrid revascularizations combining femoral endarterectomy and recanalization of iliac atherosclerotic occlusion.
METHODS: A retrospective review was conducted of all hybrid revascularizations involving femoral endarterectomy and endovascular treatment of iliac occlusion. The operations were performed in Helsinki University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2018. First, information about patients' baseline characteristics, indications and details of surgery and technical/hemodynamic success, and complications and mortality were obtained from the vascular registry and patients records. Secondarily, a prospective assessment of mid-term patency was performed through follow-up in November 2019. Immediate technical success, 30-day mortality, complications, and patency were considered major outcomes. Hemodynamic improvement, amputation rate, and overall mortality were also assessed.
RESULTS: One hundred sixty three iliofemoral occlusions were performed on 147 patients during the period studied. Six patients (3.6%) had infrarenal aortic occlusion, 86 (52.7%) had common iliac, and 128 (78.5%) had external iliac artery occlusion. Technical success rate was 88.3% (n = 144 occlusions recanalized). Primary technical success was somewhat lower in lesions ≥ 90 mm (87.1%) compared to lesions shorter than 90 mm (95.7%; χ2P = 0.06). Iliac stent was deployed in 141 (94.6%) cases, 51 (34.3%) of which were covered stents. Significant residual stenosis remained in 1.2% of cases. Median operative time was 4 hr 34 min (interquartile range 2 hr 43 min) and median estimated blood loss was 743 mL (interquartile range 500 mL). Five patients (3.0%) developed a deep groin infection and 12 (8.1%) suffered any major cardiovascular event or stroke perioperatively. Primary patency at 30 day, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years was 98.7%, 98.1%, 96.6%, and 93.7%, respectively. Hemodynamic success was documented in 107 patients (73%). By the end of the follow-up, 7 iliofemoral tracts (11.1%) reoccluded, 2 limbs (1.2%) required amputation, and 50 patients (3.0%) died.
CONCLUSIONS: Good immediate success rate and mid-term patency can be achieved by hybrid revascularization of iliofemoral occlusions. Careful patient selection is mandatory because this population often suffers from universal atherosclerosis. The involvement of the aorta represents a significant determinant of worse long-term patency, although it did not preclude technical success.
