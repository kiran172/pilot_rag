Title: Use of Interactive Visualization and 3D Printing in the Repair of Complex Congenital Heart Disease Presenting in Adult Life.

Abstract: We report a case of a 25-year-old male with a heterotaxy-like constellation of congenital heart defects consisting of complete atrioventricular septal defect, transposition of the great arteries, subpulmonary stenosis, L-looped ventricles, hypoplastic right ventricle, and a distant aorta arising from the right ventricle. This case demonstrates how 3D printing and interactive 3D visualization may facilitate a unique surgical repair.
