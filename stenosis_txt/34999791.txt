Title: Late surgical conversion of failed Multilayer Flow Modulator stenting in thoraco-abdominal aneurysms.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report the outcomes of open or hybrid repair of failed thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm endovascular treatment with Multilayer Flow Modulator (MFM) stents.
METHODS: All patients who underwent open or hybrid repair of a failed MFM aortic treatment were retrospectively analysed. Perioperative and postoperative data, as well as midterm survival, were assessed.
RESULTS: Between 2013 and 2020, 39 patients received an open or hybrid conversion after endovascular treatment. Five of them [13%; 4 males; median age 68 years (interquartile range 66-76)] were previously treated with aortic MFM stents (Cardiatis, Isnes, Belgium). Among these, the median interval between index repair and conversion was 84 months (interquartile range 75-84). The median aneurysm diameter was 9.6 cm (interquartile range 8-10). Renovisceral vessels steno-occlusion was highly prevalent: 2 renal arteries were occluded; 3 coeliac trunks, 2 renal arteries and 1 superior mesenteric artery had a >70% ostial stenosis. Open standard thoraco-abdominal aneurysm conversion was performed in 3 fit patients, while a hybrid approach with visceral debranching and tube endografting was performed in 2 high-risk patients. Two patients (2 open repairs) died intraoperatively, and 1 (hybrid repair) postoperatively. The 2 successfully treated patients are alive at 4- and 34-month follow-up, respectively, with patent visceral branches.
CONCLUSIONS: Open or hybrid thoraco-abdominal aortic aneurysm treatment after failed endovascular aortic repair with MFM stents might be the only surgical option to address sac enlargements and ruptures or branch-related failures. However, both procedures had a poor prognosis due to both the impaired preoperative patient's status and the surgical complexity in the presented series.
