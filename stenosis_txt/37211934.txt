Title: [Causes of asymptomatic side limb pain after minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible causes and preventive measures for asymptomatic pain in the limbs after minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion(MIS-TLIF).
METHODS: Clinical data from 50 patients with lumbar degenerative disease who underwent MIS-TLIF between January 2019 and September 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The group included 29 males and 21 females aged from 33 to 72 years old, with an average age of (65.3±7.13) years. Twenty-two patients underwent unilateral decompression, and 28 underwent bilateral decompression. The side(ipsilateral or contralateral) and site(low back, hip, or leg) of the pain were recorded before surgery, 3 days after surgery, and 3 months after surgery. The pain degree was evaluated using the visual analogue scale(VAS) at each time point. The patients were further grouped based on whether contralateral pain occurred postoperatively (8 cases in the contralateral pain group and 42 in the no contralateral pain group), and the causes and preventive measures of pain were analyzed.
RESULTS: All surgeries were successful, and the patients were followed up for at least 3 months. Preoperative pain on the symptomatic side improved significantly, with the VAS score decreasing from (7.00±1.79) points preoperatively to (3.38±1.32) points at 3 days postoperatively and (3.98±1.17) points at 3 months postoperatively. Postoperative asymptomatic side pain (contralateral pain) occurred in 8 patients within 3 days after surgery, accounting for 16% (8/50) of the group. The sites of contralateral pain included the lumbar area (1 case), hip(6 cases), and leg (1 case). The contralateral pain was significantly relieved 3 months after surgery.
CONCLUSION: More cases of contralateral limb pain occur after unilateral decompression MIS-TLIF, and the reason may include contralateral foramen stenosis, compression of medial branches, and other factors. To reduce this complication, the following procedures are recommended: restoring intervertebral height, inserting a transverse cage, and withdrawing screws minimally.
