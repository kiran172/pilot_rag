Title: [Repeated Heart Failure after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation Using Self-expandable Bioprosthetic Valve:Report of a Case].

Abstract: The patient was an 81-year-old man. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation( TAVI) was performed for severe aortic stenosis using Evolut R. The patient moved to intensive care unit without an adverse event after the operation. But repeated acute heart failure occurred several times during hospital stay. Mitral regurgitation (MR) was worsened from mild at baseline to moderate or more by transthoracic echocardiography. Various factors that worsened MR after TAVI have been reported, and treatment strategy for severe aortic stenosis patients with MR should be carefully developed.
