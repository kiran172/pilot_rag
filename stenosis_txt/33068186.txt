Title: Diagnostic accuracy of non-contrast quiescent-interval slice-selective (QISS) MRA combined with MRI-based vascular calcification visualization for the assessment of arterial stenosis in patients with lower extremity peripheral artery disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The proton density-weighted, in-phase stack-of-stars (PDIP-SOS) MRI technique provides calcification visualization in peripheral artery disease (PAD). This study sought to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of a combined non-contrast quiescent-interval slice-selective (QISS) MRA and PDIP-SOS MRI protocol for the detection of PAD, in comparison with CTA and digital subtraction angiography (DSA).
METHODS: Twenty-six prospectively enrolled PAD patients (70 ± 8 years) underwent lower extremity CTA and 1.5-T or 3-T PDIP-SOS/QISS MRI prior to DSA. Two readers rated image quality and graded stenosis (≥ 50%) on QISS MRA without/with calcification visualization. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated against DSA. Calcification was quantified and compared between MRI and non-contrast CT (NCCT) using paired t test, Pearson's correlation, and Bland-Altman analysis.
RESULTS: Image quality ratings were significantly higher for CTA compared to those for MRA (4.0 [3.0-4.0] and 3.0 [3.0-4.0]; p = 0.0369). The sensitivity and specificity of QISS MRA, QISS MRA with PDIP-SOS, and CTA for ≥ 50% stenosis detection were 85.4%, 92.2%, and 90.2%, and 90.3%, 93.2%, and 94.2%, respectively, while AUCs were 0.879, 0.928, and 0.923, respectively. A significant increase in AUC was observed when PDIP-SOS was added to the MRA protocol (p = 0.0266). Quantification of calcification showed significant differences between PDIP-SOS and NCCT (80.6 ± 31.2 mm3 vs. 88.0 ± 29.8 mm3; p = 0.0002) with high correlation (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.0001) and moderate mean of differences (- 7.4 mm3).
CONCLUSION: QISS MRA combined with PDIP-SOS MRI provides improved, CTA equivalent, accuracy for the detection of PAD, although its image quality remains inferior to CTA.
KEY POINTS: • Agreement in stenosis detection rate using non-contrast quiescent-interval slice-selective MRA compared to DSA improved when calcification visualization was provided to the readers. • An increase was observed in both sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ≥ 50% stenosis when MRI-based calcification assessment was added to the protocol, resulting in a diagnostic accuracy more comparable to CTA. • Quantification of calcification showed statistical difference between MRI and non-contrast CT; however, a high correlation was observed between the techniques.
