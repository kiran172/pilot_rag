Title: Costs and outcomes of mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry monitoring post-transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Aim: To estimate the costs and outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) recipients based on the use of mobile cardiac outpatient telemetry (MCOT) monitoring. Materials &amp; methods: A retrospective database study was conducted to estimate costs, contribution margins (CMs), pacemaker insertions and other outcomes for patients undergoing TAVR procedures with MCOT monitoring post-procedure versus non-MCOT monitoring. Results: A total of 4164 patients were identified (283 MCOT monitoring and 3881 non-MCOT monitoring). The rate of pacemaker insertion following hospital discharge was higher in the MCOT cohort (6.6 MCOT vs 2.1% non-MCOT; p = 0.007). MCOT use was associated with lower costs and improved CMs of the index TAVR admission (costs: US$40,569 MCOT vs $43,289 non-MCOT; p = 0.003; CMs: US$7087 MCOT vs $5177 non-MCOT; p = 0.047) with no difference through the subsequent 60-day period following discharge. Conclusion: MCOT for ambulatory cardiac monitoring post-TAVR discharge is associated with higher rates of pacemaker insertion, at no overall greater costs.
