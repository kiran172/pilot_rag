Title: Mitral valve-in-valve implantation during pregnancy.

Abstract: A 32-year-old, 11-week pregnant African woman with known rheumatic heart disease presented to the emergency department with worsening shortness of breath on exertion. She had undergone a double bioprosthetic valve replacement and left atrial appendage resection 8 years prior for severe mitral stenosis, moderate mitral regurgitation and moderate aortic regurgitation. A transo-oesophageal echocardiography at this presentation confirmed a morphologically calcified and stenosed mitral bioprosthesis, with moderate stenosis of her aortic bioprosthesis. Her multidisciplinary team, including cardiologists, cardiothoracic surgeons and obstetricians, came to a consensus decision to proceed with a transseptal transcatheter valve implantation within the mitral valve prosthesis (valve-in-valve implantation). Transthoracic echocardiography performed 2â€‰months post procedure showed satisfactory mitral valve gradients and at 30 weeks' gestation, she successfully delivered her fifth child. 2 years later, the valve in valve complex is still functioning well.
