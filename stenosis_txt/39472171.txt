Title: Feasibility, safety and efficacy of endoscopic submucosal dissection for recurrent superficial rectal neoplastic lesions after transanal microsurgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility, safety and efficacy of endoscopic submucosal dissection for recurrent rectal neoplastic lesions after transanal microsurgery of superficial rectal neoplasms.
METHODS: Multicenter retrospective study.
MAIN OUTCOMES: recurrence at first endoscopic follow-up, En bloc, R0 and curative resections.
RESULTS: 39 patients were included. 71 % percent of lesions were located in the lower rectum, 57 % reached the pectineal line. 67 % were laterally spreading tumor granular type, 33 % were protruding lesions. Median size was 41 mm (IQR 30 - 60). Median operation time was 70 min (IQR 35 - 97). 92 % were successfully resected en bloc. R0 and curative resection rates were 77 % and 71 %, respectively. Perirectal fat was visualized in 10 patients, none of them required surgery. One significant hematochezia (3 %), two stenosis (6 %) and one untreatable anal incontinence (3 %) occurred. Median hospital stay after endoscopic submucosal dissection was 2 days (IQR 1-2). Median period for the first endoscopy follow-up was 6 months (IQR 4-8). A single post endoscopic submucosal dissection recurrence adenoma was found during follow-up (3 %), occurring after a non-en bloc resection.
CONCLUSION: Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a good option for safely achieving high rates of complete en bloc resection in cases of recurrent superficial rectal tumor after transanal microsurgery.
