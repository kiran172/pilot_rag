Title: Transcriptome Profiling of Hippocampus After Cerebral Hypoperfusion in Mice.

Abstract: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is considered to be one of the major mechanism in the pathogenesis of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI). Increased inflammatory cells, particularly microglia, often parallel hypoperfusion-induced gray matter damage such as hippocampal lesions, but the exact mechanism remains largely unknown. To understand the pathological mechanisms, we analyzed hippocampus-specific transcriptome profiles after cerebral hypoperfusion. The mouse hypoperfusion model was induced by employing the 0.16/0.18 mm bilateral common carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) procedure. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was assessed after 3-week hypoperfusion. Pathological changes were evaluated via hematoxylin staining and immunofluorescence staining. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed using RNA samples of sham- or BCAS-operated mice, followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation. We found that the 0.16/0.18 mm BCAS induced decreased CBF, hippocampal neuronal loss, and microglial activation. Furthermore, GSEA between sham and BCAS mice showed activation of interferon-beta signaling along with inflammatory immune responses. In addition, integrative analysis with published single-cell RNA-seq revealed that up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in a distinct cell type of "microglia," and down-regulated DEGs were enriched in "CA1 pyramidal," not in "interneurons" or "S1 pyramidal." This database of transcriptomic profiles of BCAS-hypoperfusion will be useful for future studies to explore potential targets for vascular cognitive dysfunction.
