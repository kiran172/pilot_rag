Title: The resolute Onyx in TIA management (ROTIA).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: First-line treatment for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is medical management; however, interventional approaches are increasingly considered for refractory disease. The Resolute Onyx in TIA management (ROTIA) study is a post-market evaluation of the Resolute Onyx (R-Onyx) drug-eluting stent in the treatment of recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) due to refractory ICAD (off-label use).
METHODS: This is a single-center, retrospective case series of consecutive patients who underwent angioplasty and stenting with R-Onyx for treatment of recurrent TIAs due to refractory ICAD from October 2019 to November 2022. Included patients were ages 22-80, had a baseline modified Rankin Scale of ≤2, and had recurrent TIAs attributed to intracranial artery stenosis >70% despite maximal medical therapy. Primary outcomes of interest were peri-procedural complications (TIA, stroke, intracranial hemorrhage, mortality) up to 72 h post-stenting and ischemic stroke up to 18 months post-stenting.
RESULTS: Twenty patients (mean age 66.84 ± 14; 25% female; 80% Hispanic) were included. A total of 21 stents were successfully deployed with no peri-procedural complications. There were no recurrent ischemic events at 30 days post-stenting. At 18 months post-stenting, there were no ischemic events and no patient exhibited in-stent restenosis.
CONCLUSION: ROTIA demonstrates the feasibility of using the Resolute Onyx drug-eluting stent for the management of TIAs due to refractory ICAD, with high technical success and low peri-procedural complications. Limitations include the retrospective and single-center nature of this study. Future prospective, multi-center, randomized trials with extended observation periods are needed.
