Title: Modified Puestow Procedure for Chronic Pancreatitis in a Child Due to Annular Pancreas and Duodenal Duplication: A Case Report.

Abstract: An 18-year-old woman with annular pancreas and duodenal duplication presented with recurrent acute pancreatitis and underwent a resection of duodenal duplication. However, the patient experienced recurrent abdominal pain after resection. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilatation of the peripheral pancreatic duct and stenosis and malformation of both the Wirsung's and Santorini's duct due to multiple stones. The modified puestow procedure was performed. The main pancreatic ducts in the body and tail were opened, and the intrapancreatic common bile duct was preserved. A Roux-en-Y pancreatico-jejunostomy was performed for reconstructing the pancreaticobiliary system after removing the ductal protein plug. The patient experienced no abdominal pain, no significant elevation of the serum amylase and lipase levels, and no stone formation during the 2 years of follow-up. This procedure is considered to be beneficial for pediatric patients with chronic pancreatitis due to annular pancreas and duodenal duplication.
