Title: Quantitative Assessment Using the Compartment Model for Detecting Regional Coronary Artery Disease by Dynamic Myocardial Perfusion Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using an original analysis tool in the compartment model for detecting regional significant coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: This study analyzed 41 patients (median age, 76 years) with suspected or known CAD who underwent both dynamic SPECT using 99 mTc-tetrofosmin and invasive coronary angiography. The quantitative analysis was performed using a single-tissue compartment model to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the myocardial flow reserve (MFR) for regional significant CAD, excluding infarcted territories. In the regional analysis, 114 vessels were assessed, of which 31 were diagnosed as significant coronary lesions (≥70% stenosis and/or fraction flow reserve ≤0.8). The MFR of regional significant CAD was significantly lower than that of non-significant CAD (1.11 [0.97-1.31] vs. 1.74 [1.30-2.27]; P&lt;0.001). In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the MFR displayed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.81. While analyzing each coronary artery territory, the diagnostic performance of the MFR value in the left anterior descending (LAD) artery territory was found to be significantly higher than that found in qualitative assessment (AUC: 0.84 vs. 0.61).
CONCLUSIONS: A quantitative analysis of dynamic SPECT data facilitated detecting regional CAD. For the LAD artery, the MFR displayed a higher diagnostic performance than the qualitative assessment of conventional myocardial perfusion SPECT.
