Title: Successful surgery of neuroendocrine carcinoma infiltrating right ventricle and pulmonary artery.

Abstract: We present the clinical case of a 60-year-old woman complained of dyspnea on exertion. Echocardiogram showed a giant mass in the right ventricle (RV) with obstruction to the outflow tract. Thorax computed tomography confirmed a mass of greater than 60 mm infiltrating RV and causing severe stenosis in the pulmonary artery, with severe pericardial effusion. Cardiac surgery was performed for tumor resection and pulmonary root replacement with a biological valved conduit. Histological analysis diagnosed a poorly differentiated large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma. The patient had no immediate postoperative complications and has completed radiotherapy at a 9-month follow-up.
