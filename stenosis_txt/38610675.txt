Title: Novel Cervical Endoscopic Unilateral Laminoforaminotomy for Bilateral Decompression in Cervical Spondylosis Myeloradiculopathy: A Technical Note and Clinical Results.

Abstract: Background: This study investigates the efficacy of the Cervical Endoscopic Unilateral Laminoforaminotomy for Bilateral Decompression (CE-ULFBD) technique in treating cervical myeloradiculopathy, primarily caused by degenerative spondylosis. Traditionally managed through multisegmental anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) or laminoplasty combined with foraminotomy, this condition has recently experienced a promising shift towards minimally invasive approaches, particularly endoscopic spinal decompression. While empirical evidence is still emerging, these techniques show potential for effective treatment. Method: The objective was to evaluate the outcomes of CE-ULFBD in achieving single or multilevel bilateral foraminal and central decompression, emphasizing the reduction of injury to posterior cervical muscles and the associated postoperative neck soreness common in conventional procedures. This paper delineates the surgical procedures involved in CE-ULFBD and presents the clinical outcomes of nine patients diagnosed with myeloradiculopathy due to severe cervical stenosis. Result: Assessments were conducted using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for neck and arm pain and the Modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association scale (mJOA) for the activity measurement of daily living. Results indicated a considerable decrease in pain levels according to the VAS, coupled with significant improvements in functional capacities as measured by the mJOA scale. Additionally, no major postoperative complications were noted during the follow-up period. Conclusion: The study concludes that CE-ULFBD is a safe and effective approach for the treatment of cervical myeloradiculopathy resulting from severe cervical stenosis, offering a viable and less invasive alternative to traditional decompressive surgeries.
