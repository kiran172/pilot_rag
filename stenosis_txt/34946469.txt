Title: Is the Severity of Cervical Foraminal Stenosis Related to the Severity and Sidedness of Symptoms?

Abstract: (1) Background: Cervical foraminal stenosis (CFS) is a common cause of axial neck and arm pain. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the severity of CFS and clinical symptoms in terms of severity and sidedness. (2) Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 75 consecutive patients with degenerative CFS. We graded 900 foramina from C3-4 to T1-2 using Park's grading system. We collected visual analogue scale (VAS) and neck disability index (NDI) values from the neck and both arms. We analyzed the relationships with CFS grades and total number. We defined four types of left/right dominance of CFS (none, left-dominant, right-dominant, and both) by comparing left and right sides using total counts and maximal grade of CFS, respectively. We compared arm pain sidedness (no arm pain, left-only, right only, and bilateral) among different left and right CFS dominance types. (3) Results: Mean neck and left and right arm VAS scores were 4.4 ± 2.5, 4.9 ± 1.6, and 4.6 ± 2.0, respectively. The mean total NDI was 16.0 ± 8.0. The CFS grade at C3-4 and total count were correlated with neck VAS. Arm VAS was also correlated with CFS grade and total counts. Total NDI score was not correlated with radiological parameters. The presence and sidedness of arm pain were significantly different between left and right CFS dominance groups divided by total count of grade 2 and 3 CFS. (4) Conclusions: The CFS grade and total count were correlated with neck and arm VAS. Arm pain occurred more frequently on the side with more grade 2 and 3 CFS.
