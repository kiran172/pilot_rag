Title: Intralesional steroids in refractory caustic esophageal stricture.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To analyze the efficacy of intralesional steroid treatment in refractory caustic esophageal stricture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: An analytical, retrospective study of patients receiving intralesional steroid treatment with triamcinolone acetonide as a result of refractory caustic esophageal stricture was carried out. Demographic variables, stricture characteristics, number of dilations, steroid injections, and dilation score (no. of dilations/follow-up period in months) pre- and post-treatment were collected. Stricture characteristics (diameter and length) and dilation score pre- and post-treatment were compared using the T-Test or Wilcoxon test.
RESULTS: N= 5. Median age: 5 years (17 months-7 years). Follow-up: 6.60 ± 2.70 years. Swallowed products included NaOH, KOH, and ClH. Zargar classification at follow-up initiation was IIb (n= 2), IIIa (n= 1), and two chronic strictures. 6.6 ± 9.23 esophageal dilations were carried out before steroid treatment initiation. The mean number of intralesional therapy sessions was 11.20 ± 6.14. Stricture length decreased by 3.60 ± 2.63 cm (t= 3.06; p= 0.019). No differences were found in terms of diameter increase: -1.60 ± 3.58 mm (t= -1.00; p= 0.187). The dilation score diminished from 1.47 ± 0.86 to 0.47 ± 0.18 dilations per month of follow-up (Z= -2.02; p= 0.043).
CONCLUSIONS: Even though there is limited evidence available in the pediatric population, intralesional triamcinolone treatment is seemingly useful in the treatment of refractory caustic esophageal stricture, since it reduces length and dilation score.
