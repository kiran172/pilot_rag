Title: Prenatal Diagnosis of Ductus Arteriosus Anomalies: A Single-Center Study.

Abstract: To evaluate the fetal ductus arteriosus anomalies diagnosed by fetal echocardiography. The perinatal outcomes and associated cardiac and genetic anomalies are also explored. The fetal echocardiography records of 2366 fetuses were evaluated retrospectively. Thirty-seven pregnancies prenatally diagnosed with ductus arteriosus anomalies and evaluated after delivery were enrolled in the study. Perinatal and obstetric outcomes were analyzed. The incidence of ductus arteriosus anomaly in our series was 1.5% (37/2366). The most frequent ductus arteriosus anomaly detected was right-sided ductus arteriosus followed by aneurysm, constriction and bilateral ductus arteriosus with an incidence of 51.3%, 27.1%, 18.9% and 2.7%, respectively. There were 19 fetuses with right-sided ductus arteriosus, of which 15 had tetralogy of Fallot. There were 2 chromosomal anomalies (22q11 microdeletion) in this group. Of the 7 fetuses with ductus arteriosus constriction, 3 (3/7, 42.9%) died in-utero. There were 2 (2/10, 20%) neonatal deaths due to hypoplastic left heart syndrome in the ductus arteriosus aneurysm group. Various types of ductus arteriosus anomalies can be diagnosed prenatally. Perinatal outcomes mostly dependent on the type of the ductus arteriosus anomaly and accompanying cardiac malformations.
