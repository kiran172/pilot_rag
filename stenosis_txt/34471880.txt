Title: A Rare Case of Transposition of Great Arteries Uncovered With Progressive Rheumatic Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: The authors describe a case of transposition of great arteries with a large atrial septal defect with fusion of tricuspid valve leaflets and severe aortic stenosis. The latter two were likely rheumatic in etiology. The patient's condition improved after atrial switch and aortic valve replacement surgery. (Level of Difficulty: Intermediate.).
