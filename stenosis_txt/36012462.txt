Title: Non-Fasting Hypertriglyceridemia Burden as a Residual Risk of the Progression of Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: The relationships between repeated non-fasting triglyceride (TG) measurements and carotid stenosis progression during follow-ups have never been investigated. In 111 consecutive carotid arteries of 88 patients with ≥50% atherosclerotic stenosis on at least one side, who had ≥3 blood samples taken during ≥one-year follow-ups, clinical variables were compared between carotid arteries with and without subsequent stenosis progression. To evaluate non-fasting TG burden, a new parameter area [TG ≥ 175] was calculated by integrating non-fasting TG values ≥ 175 mg/dL (i.e., TG values minus 175) with the measurement intervals (year). Carotid stenosis progression occurred in 22 arteries (19.8%) during the mean follow-up period of 1185 days. Younger age, symptomatic stenosis, higher mean values of TG during follow-ups, the area [TG ≥ 175], mean TG values ≥ 175 mg/dL and maximum TG values ≥175 mg/dL were significant factors related to the progression on univariate analyses. The cut-off value of the area [TG ≥ 175] to discriminate carotid stenosis progression was 6.35 year-mg/dL. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that symptomatic stenosis and the area [TG ≥ 175] ≥ 6.35 year-mg/dL were independently related to carotid stenosis progression. In conclusion, the area [TG ≥ 175] was an independent risk factor for carotid stenosis progression, and this study suggests the importance to continuously control non-fasting TG levels < 175 mg/dL during follow-ups to prevent carotid stenosis progression.
