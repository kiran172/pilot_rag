Title: Cutaneous necrosis of the arteriovenous fistula puncture site in chronic hemodialysis: A historical complication or an ever-present threat? A series of 26 cases.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Cutaneous necrosis (CN) at the puncture site of the arteriovenous fistula (AVF) in chronic hemodialysis (CHD) is a rare but potentially fatal complication. The objective of our work was to establish the associated complications, vascular prognosis, and patient survival of CHD patients presenting cutaneous necrosis.
METHODS: This retrospective study (January 2016 to March 2020) was conducted in the Department of Vascular Surgery and the Department of Nephrology at the University Hospital Center Mohammed VI of Oujda, Morocco. Included were all CHD patients admitted for treatment of cutaneous necrosis at the puncture site of a native AVF.
RESULTS: Data from 26 cases were collected. The mean age was 58.7 ± 16 years, 70.8% were female, and 25% had diabetic nephropathy; 42.3% of the AVFs were radiocephalic and 46.1% were brachiocephalic; 42.2% of patients presented active bleeding, of whom 91% required a blood transfusion; 80.8% of the AVFs were complicated by aneurysms. Fistulography showed stenosis in 42.3% of cases. Urgent surgical intervention was performed on all the patients. Fifty percent of patients required placement of a short-term hemodialysis catheter. Two patients had presented a recurrence. Death occurred in one case following a massive hemorrhagic shock.
CONCLUSION: Cutaneous necrosis is a relatively common complication and requires early screening and immediate surgical intervention.
