Title: Rescue Valve-in-Valve-in-Valve TAVR for Acute Transvalvular Aortic Regurgitation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a well-established treatment option for severe symptomatic aortic stenosis (Leon et al., 2016), and recently has also been utilised for bioprosthetic surgical aortic valve (sAVR) failure (valve-in-valve TAVR (ViV-TAVR)) (Yoon et al., 2017; Nalluri et al., 2018). Data supporting ViV-TAVR are limited to observational studies but suggest similar outcomes to re-do sAVR in high risk patients (Barbanti et al., n.d.). Whilst bioprosthetic SAVR failure is well documented, TAVR failure is less well described (Barbanti et al., n.d.). Here, we describe a case of TAVR failure in a previous sAVR resulting in the need for emergent valve-in-valve-in-valve TAVR (ViViV-TAVR).
