Title: Fascio-cutaneous-free flaps as primary reconstruction in salvage total laryngectomy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Salvage total laryngectomy (STL) is the most common treatment for recurrent laryngeal cancer after (chemo)-radiotherapy [(C)RT]. In this scenario, a higher rate of local wound complications, such as pharyngo-cutaneous fistula (PCF) and pharyngo-esophageal stenosis (PES), is generally expected. The aim of the present study is to evaluate outcomes using a standardized reconstructive protocol.
METHODS: Between 2009 and 2019, patients undergoing STL after (C)RT were collected at two referral hospitals with the objective of evaluating surgical outcomes using a standardized reconstructive policy based on the use of fascio-cutaneous free flaps as inlay patch grafts and a long-lasting salivary bypass stent.
RESULTS: Fifty-five patients (mean age, 66Â years; male-to-female ratio, 8:1) were included in the study. Previous treatments were RT in 22 (40%) patients, CRT in 21 (38.2%), and partial laryngeal surgery followed by adjuvant (C)RT in 12 (21.8%). Reconstruction was accomplished by radial forearm and anterolateral thigh free flaps in 16 (29.1%) and 39 (70.9%) patients, respectively. Flap success rate was 98.2%. Concerning postoperative complications, we encountered 3 PCFs (5.4%) and 1 PES (1.8%).
CONCLUSION: The standardized reconstructive protocol analyzed herein granted significantly lower rates of PCF and PES after STL compared with data available in the literature.
