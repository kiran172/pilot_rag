Title: Diagnostic performance of pressure-bounded coronary flow reserve.

Abstract: Fluid dynamics studies have proposed that coronary flow reserve can be calculated from coronary artery pressure instead of coronary blood flow. We sought to investigate the diagnostic performance of pressure-bounded coronary flow reserve (pb-CFR) compared with CFR measured by conventional thermodilution method (CFR<sub>thermo</sub>) in the clinical setting. Pressure guidewire was used to measure CFR<sub>thermo</sub> and fractional flow reserve (FFR) in left anterior descending coronary artery in 62 patients with stable coronary artery disease. Pb-CFR was calculated only with resting distal coronary artery pressure (Pd), resting aortic pressure (Pa) and FFR. Pb-CFR was moderately correlated with CFR<sub>thermo</sub> (r = 0.54, P &lt; 0.001). Pb-CFR showed a poor agreement with CFR<sub>thermo</sub>, presenting large values of mean difference and root mean square deviation (1.5 ± 1.4). Pb-CFR &lt; 2.0 predicted CFR<sub>thermo</sub> &lt; 2.0 with an accuracy of 79%, sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 78%, positive predictive value of 48%, negative predictive value of 95%. The discordance presenting CFR<sub>thermo</sub> &lt; 2.0 and pb-CFR ≥ 2.0 was associated with diffuse disease (P &lt; 0.001). The discordance presenting CFR<sub>thermo</sub> ≥ 2 and pb-CFR &lt; 2 was associated with a high FFR (P = 0.002). Pb-CFR showed moderate correlation and poor agreement with CFR<sub>thermo</sub>. Pb-CFR might be reliable in excluding epicardial coronary artery disease and microcirculatory disorders.
