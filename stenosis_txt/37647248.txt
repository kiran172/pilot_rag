Title: Effects of size and shape of the side holes of a double J stent on the ureter fluid flow after stenosis.

Abstract: The effect of side holes morphology changes in double J stent (DJS) on encrustation was analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). We analyzed DJS side holes with inner diameter of 1â€‰mm and outer diameters of 1 (type A), 1.2 (type B) and 1.4 (type C) mm, respectively. Concentric stenosis with three intraureteral degree (0%, 12%, and 88%) was analyzed. The flow rate, shear stress and wall shear stress (WSS) distribution were investigated. Urine flow through SH1 before the ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) differed based on the ureteral stenosis degree. The sum of flow rates through the SHs increased with diameter. In the stented ureter with 12% stenosis, the flow rate through SH1 approximately doubled than that without ureteral stenosis, and the flow rate through SH1 was maximal for the type 'C' stent in both 12% and 88% ureteral stenosis. The mean shear stress in the SHs increased with the degree of stenosis. The WSS around the SHs was higher for type 'C' than types A and B. From the flow rates and shear stresses in and around the SHs, the larger SH diameter of the DJS from the UPJ to mid-ureter is expected to induce encrustation reduction, especially in patients with urinary lithiasis.
