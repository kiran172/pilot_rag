Title: A Case of Wellens Syndrome in a Young Adult With Intermittent Chest Pain: Understanding the Unique Pattern and Clinical Correlation.

Abstract: Wellens syndrome is a unique electrocardiographic (ECG) pattern usually suggestive of critical stenosis of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Providers must recognize this pattern as it frequently occurs in symptom-free periods and represents a pre-infarction stage requiring early intervention. We present the case of a 39-year-old male with a past medical history of hypertension who was brought to the emergency department due to complaints of worsening recurrent intermittent squeezing left-sided chest pain of two months duration. Cardiac enzymes were within limits. ECG done at triage was significant for biphasic T waves in leads V2-V5 consistent with type A Wellens syndrome. The cardiology team consulted, with the patient subsequently having a percutaneous coronary intervention to the mid and proximal portion of the LAD.Â The patient was later discharged on the third day of admission on guideline-directed medical therapy, with plans to follow up closely with the cardiology clinic. This case highlights the significance of using the characteristics pattern of Wellens syndrome in providing critical diagnostic and prognostic value. This article aimed to promote awareness of Wellens syndrome, the clinical correlation, and the role of timely acute management.
