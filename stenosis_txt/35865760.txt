Title: Evaluation of pulmonary blood flow in bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunts: value of 4-D flow cardiac magnetic resonance in the evaluation of pulmonary artery confluence stenosis.

Abstract: Bilateral bidirectional Glenn shunts are associated with the risk of developing pulmonary artery bifurcation stenosis, resulting in variable pulmonary blood flow to either lung. This could negatively impact the subsequent stages of the single ventricle palliation pathway. This report highlights the value of 4D flow sequence from the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in demonstrating the pulmonary blood flow characteristics following a bilateral bidirectional Glenn procedure. Mapping the blood flow pattern and its quantification to each lung provide objective insights into the possible predisposing factors for the development of pulmonary bifurcation stenosis.
