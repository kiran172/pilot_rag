Title: Role of Point-of-Care Cerebral Ultrasonography in Determining the Etiology of Post-carotid Endarterectomy Deficit: A Case Report.

Abstract: Carotid revascularization surgery is notorious for its neurological morbimortality. We report the case of a 74-year-old hypertensive patient, who underwent left internal carotid artery endarterectomy for a 90% stenosis under general anesthesia, presenting in the immediate postoperative period with right hemiplegia without consciousness disorders. Evaluation by cerebral ultrasound at bedside led to suspicion of intracerebral hemorrhage, which was confirmed by cerebral CT scan. The patient was treated by neuroresuscitation measures in the absence of the possibility of surgical intervention. This hemorrhage may be explained by a reperfusion injury due to the loss of cerebral autoregulation of these vessels, the loss of controlling blood pressure, and the use of heparin in vascular surgery. This is a rare but fatal complication with a high mortality rate.
