Title: Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis Combined with Thoracic Spinal Stenosis Treated by Endoscopic Surgery: A Case Report.

Abstract: CASE: A 48-year-old man presented to our facility with debilitating motor and sensory symptoms due to advanced T10-11 thoracic spinal stenosis secondary to diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). The patient's condition was addressed with endoscopic spine surgery through a yet-to-be-reported interlaminar approach, and at the 12-month follow-up, his neurologic function was significantly improved.
CONCLUSION: Select patients with symptomatic thoracic spinal stenosis secondary to DISH can be effectively managed with endoscopic spine surgery through an interlaminar approach by clinicians with extensive endoscopic spine experience.
