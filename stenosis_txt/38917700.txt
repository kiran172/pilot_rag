Title: Successful management of unilateral nasal vestibular stenosis caused by trauma: A case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Nasal vestibular stenosis is a rare trauma-related nasal congestion.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 52-year-old man complained of right nasal obstruction for 2 weeks caused by hot metal fragments from a gas cylinder explosion 7 weeks before. The patient was diagnosed with right nasal vestibular stenosis due to nasal trauma based on physical examination and CT scan. The patient underwent right nasal vestibular stenosis repair for 2 h without complications. The patient was positioned with the head elevated 20° and received IVFD RD5 therapy at a rate of 1500 mL/day, ceftriaxone 2 × 1 g/day, metamizole 3 × 1 g/day, and ranitidine 2 × 50 mg/day. On the second day, there was no bleeding, pain, or nasal congestion, and an anterior rhinoscopy showed a silicone tube in place. The patient was discharged the same day and started on oral cefixime 2 × 200 mg/day, gentamicin ointment and nasal saline irrigation (NSI) 2 × 100 mL/day for both nostrils. Three months after surgery, the septal stitches and silicone tube were removed and no bleeding was found.
DISCUSSION: The management of vestibular stenosis caused by trauma has a higher success rate than other types of vestibular stenosis. Prompt management plays a crucial role in successfully treating unilateral vestibular stenosis caused by trauma.
CONCLUSION: Prompt management is highly effective in treating unilateral vestibular stenosis.
