Title: Cryptogenic multifocal ulcerative stenosing enteritis (CMUSE) diagnosed by retrograde motorized spiral enteroscopy.

Abstract: We present the case of a 59-years-old woman with a history of abdominal pain and iron-deficiency anemia. Upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy turned out negative and further investigation with wireless videocapsule showed an inflammatory stricture in the middle of the small bowel with retention of the videocapsule. Treatment with budesonide was initiated and allowed the spontaneous evacuation of the videocapsule. Retrograde motorized spiral enteroscopy was performed and confirmed an ulcerative stricture 60 cm proximal to the ileocaecal valve. Clinical, iconographic, endoscopic and histological results were compatible with a rare entity described as cryptogenic multifocal ulcerative stenosing enteritis (CMUSE). After the diagnosis budesonide was replaced by azathioprine 100 mg/d as an immunosuppressor. However, azathioprine induced mild pancreatitis and a second course of budesonide was started again. Clinical evolution was favorable.
