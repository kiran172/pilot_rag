Title: First Percutaneous Balloon Mitral Valvuloplasty in a Pregnant Patient in Tanzania.

Abstract: Percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty (PBMV) is a safe alternative to management of a pregnant woman with mitral stenosis. We report the first successful PBMV in a 27-year-old pregnant patient in Tanzania at 32 weeks gestation with NYHA functional class III symptoms. PBMV yielded excellent results.
