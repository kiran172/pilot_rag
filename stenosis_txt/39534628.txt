Title: Severe Rheumatic Mitral Stenosis During Pregnancy.

Abstract: A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, with previously unknown severe rheumatic mitral stenosis presented with progressive dyspnea at 26 weeks of gestation. Percutaneous commissurotomy was considered but was deferred after symptom improvement with beta-blockers and diuretics. Pregnancy complications ensued, requiring preterm delivery. Postpartum percutaneous commissurotomy was successful, highlighting the complexities in managing rheumatic heart disease during pregnancy.
