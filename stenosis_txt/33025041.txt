Title: Ultrasonographic and hemodynamic characteristics of patients with symptomatic carotid near-occlusion: results from a multicenter registry study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The ultrasonographic and hemodynamic features of patients with carotid near-occlusion (CNO) are still not well known. Our aim was to describe the ultrasonographic and hemodynamic characteristics of a cohort of patients with CNO.
METHODS: A prospective, observational, nationwide, and multicenter study was conducted from January/2010 to May/2016. Patients with digital subtraction angiography (DSA)-confirmed CNO were included. We collected information on clinical and demographic characteristics, carotid and transcranial ultrasonography and DSA findings, presence of full-collapse, collateral circulation, and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR).
RESULTS: One hundred thirty-five patients were analyzed. Ultrasonographic and DSA diagnosis of CNO were concordant in only 44%. This disagreement was related to the presence/absence of full-collapse: 45% of patients with CNO with full-collapse were classified as a complete carotid occlusion, and 40% with a CNO without full-collapse were interpreted as severe stenosis (p < 0.001). Mean velocities (mV) and pulsatility indexes (PIs) were significantly lower in the ipsilateral middle cerebral artery compared with the contralateral (43 cm/s vs 58 cm/s, p < 0.001; 0.80 vs 1.00, p < 0.001). Collateral circulation was identified in 92% of patients, with the anterior communicating artery (73%) being the most frequent. CVR was decreased or exhausted in 66% of cases and was more frequent in patients with a poor or absent collateral network compared with patients with â‰¥ 2 collateral arteries (82% vs 56%, p = 0.051).
CONCLUSION: The accuracy of carotid ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CNO seems to be limited, with significant discrepancies with DSA. Decreased ipsilateral mV, PI, and CVR suggest a hemodynamic compromise in patients with CNO.
