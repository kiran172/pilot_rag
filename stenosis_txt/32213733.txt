Title: A case of stricture-type ischemic colitis from excessive alcohol consumption, with follow-up to rule out colon cancer.

Abstract: A 69-year-old man was admitted to Hanawa Kousei Hospital with acute hepatitis attributed to alcohol consumption. His condition improved with conservative treatment. Computed tomography (CT) showed localized thickening of the colonic wall at the splenic flexure;carcinoembryonic antigen level was slightly elevated to 9.7 ng/mL. Colonoscopy (CS) showed an ulcerative lesion in the colonic splenic flexure. Ischemic colitis (IC) and type 4 colon cancer were suspected, but biopsy was not confirmatory. Malignancy could not be ruled out by contrast-enhanced CT;repeat CS showed circumferential stenosis of the colonic splenic flexure. Ischemic colitis was suspected based on changes between the first and second CS. Biopsy histopathology led us to diagnose stricture-type IC. Constipation, but not intestinal obstruction, occurred. Conservative treatment improved the stenosis. Excessive alcohol consumption may lead to IC;imaging studies may be useful to distinguish IC from colon cancer. Since most cases of ischemic colitis can be improved with conservative treatment, patients with stricture-type ischemic colitis may also be treated without surgery early on, with follow-up that includes careful, periodic imaging.
