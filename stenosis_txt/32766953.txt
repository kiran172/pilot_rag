Title: Safety of Early Administration of Apixaban on Clinical Outcomes in Patients with Acute Large Vessel Occlusion.

Abstract: Early administration of direct oral anticoagulants in patients with acute large vessel occlusion (LVO) and nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) is a concern, as endovascular therapy (EVT) became highly utilized. We conducted a historical and prospective multicenter registry at 38 centers in Japan from July 2016 to February 2018. Patients aged ≥ 20 years with NVAF and acute LVO or stenosis who received apixaban within 14 days from onset were included. We compared patients who received apixaban < 48 h (Early group) and ≥ 48 h (Late group) after onset in terms of the primary outcome (a composite of ischemic events, major bleeding events, and all-cause deaths). The secondary outcomes were each component of the primary outcome. Among the 686 patients, the median time from onset to administration was 2.5 days (range, 0-14; Early 263, Late 423). The Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)-ASPECTS) were significantly higher in the Early group than in the Late group. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) and EVT were more utilized in the Early group (rt-PA 46% vs. 35%, p = 0.003; EVT 62% vs. 46%, p < 0.0001). The cumulative incidence of primary outcome was similar between groups (ischemic events: Early 1.9% vs. Late 0.5% at 30 days; 3.5% vs. 0.7% at 90 days, major bleeding 3.4% vs. 2.9% at 30 days; 5.0% vs. 3.4% at 90 days). Early administration of apixaban (< 48 h), after onset of acute LVO in patients with NVAF, was generally safe compared with those who received it Late (≥ 48 h). http://www.clinicaltrials.gov .
