Title: Duration of stenting with Montgomery T-tubes in severe laryngotracheal stenosis: does it matter?

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Laryngotracheal stenosis management remains largely discretionary in surgical practice. Duration of stenting remains variable following open reconstruction procedures in absence of clearly established differences. The current study evaluates successful decannulation after short-term periods compared with longer periods.
METHOD: A comparative study over 18 months evaluated differences in successful decannulation between short- and long-term stent groups. Patients with grade II, III or IV laryngotracheal stenosis were placed on Montgomery T-tube for a short-term period (n = 15), and decannulation rates were compared with age-, sex- and diagnosis-matched patients (n = 15) from historical cases with long-term stent placement.
RESULTS: Thirty patients were included. There was no difference between the two groups at baseline. Nine patients (30 per cent) were successfully decannulated, and there was no difference in rates of decannulation between the two groups (p = 0.8). Granulations at the proximal end of tube (38.7 per cent), superior migration of tube (16.1 per cent) and dysphonia (12.9 per cent) were common complications.
CONCLUSION: Decannulation was not more successful after placing Montgomery T-tubes for longer periods of time when compared with removal within the first three months. Early removal after proper case selection and planning may be considered for a successful outcome in laryngotracheal stenosis.
