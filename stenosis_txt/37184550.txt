Title: [Atresia or severe stenosis of the external auditory canals with normal auricles in children].

Abstract: In the article we present the experience of observing 27 children with bilateral stenosis or atresia of the external auditory canals with normal or slightly hypoplastic auricles. Three children had bilateral stenosis of the external auditory canals due to abnormal or premature fusion of the skull bones. The remaining 24 children had external auditory canals atresia in the bone part or throughout. 9 of them had a syndrome of deletion of the long arm of chromosome 18, 1 child had a mosaic form of Edwards syndrome. The average age at the time of diagnosis was 4 years 3 months. Atresia of external auditory canals in normal auricle is often caused by abnormalities of 18 pairs of chromosomes, and severe stenosis of external auditory canals can be observed in children with craniostenosis and other anomalies of the skull bones.
