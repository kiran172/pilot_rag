Title: Effects of Early-Stage Blood Pressure Variability on the Functional Outcome in Acute Ischemic Stroke Patients With Symptomatic Intracranial Artery Stenosis or Occlusion Receiving Intravenous Thrombolysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies exploring the relationship between blood pressure (BP) fluctuations and outcome in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) are limited. We aimed to investigate the influence of blood pressure variability (BPV) during the first 24 h after IVT on early neurological deterioration (END) and 3-month outcome after IVT in terms of different stroke subtypes.
METHODS: Clinical data from consecutive AIS patients who received IVT were retrospectively analyzed. The hourly systolic BP of all patients were recorded during the first 24 h following IVT. We calculated three systolic BPV parameters, including coefficient of variability (CV), standard deviation of mean BP (SD) and successive variation (SV), within the first 6, 12, and 24 h after IVT. END was defined as neurological deterioration with an increase in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score ≥ 4 points within the first 72 h after admission. Follow-up was performed at 90 days after onset, and favorable and poor outcomes were defined as a modified Rankin Scale scores (mRS) of ≤1 or ≥2, respectively.
RESULTS: A total of 339 patients, which were divided into those with (intracranial artery stenosis or occlusion group, SIASO group) and without (non-SIASO group) SIASO, were included. Among them, 110 patients (32.4%) were with SIASO. Patients in SIASO group had higher NIHSS on admission and difference in term of mRS at 90 days compared with non-SIASO group (P &lt; 0.001). In SIASO group, patients in favorable outcome group were younger and had lower NIHSS on admission, lower SV-24 h (14.5 ± 4.3 vs. 11.8 ± 3.2, respectively) and lower SD-24 h (12.7 ± 3.8 vs. 10.9 ± 3.3, respectively), compared with patients with poor outcome (all P &lt; 0.05). In the multivariable logistic regression analysis, compared with the lowest SV (SV &lt; 25% quartile), SV<sub>50-75%</sub> [odds ratio (OR) = 4.449, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.231-16.075, P = 0.023] and SV<sub>&gt;75%</sub> (OR = 8.676, 95% CI = 1.892-39.775, P = 0.005) were significantly associated with poor outcome at 3 months in patients with SIASO, adjusted for age, NIHSS on admission and atrial fibrillation. No BPV parameters were associated with END in SIASO group. In non-SIASO group, there were no significant association between BPV patterns and END or 90-day outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: SV-24 h had a negative relationship with 3-month outcome in AIS patients with SIASO treated with IVT, indicating that BPV may affect the outcome of AIS.
