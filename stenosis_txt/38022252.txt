Title: Pseudoaneurysm and Renal Artery Stenosis Post-renal Transplant: A Rare Presentation.

Abstract: We report the case of a 51-year-old gentleman who underwent living renal transplantation in Pakistan for end-stage renal disease one and a half years ago. He presented to our hospital with renal artery stenosis and an extra-renal pseudoaneurysm at the anastomotic site of the transplanted kidney. This can cause graft dysfunction and hypertension due to impairment of arterial perfusion in the transplanted kidney. Treatment with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and covered stenting of the pseudoaneurysm and stenosis improved kidney function and hypertension.
