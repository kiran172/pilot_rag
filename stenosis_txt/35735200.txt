Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Angioplasty for Thoracic Great Vessel Stenosis Due to Takayasu Arteritis With 1-Year Follow-up.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Takayasu arteritis is a large-vessel vasculitis in women of childbearing age that affects large vessels including the aorta and its main branches. Inflammation of arteries can produce lesions that lead to occlusion, stenosis, or aneurysms which can lead to complications. If signs of organ dysfunction are present, vascular intervention may be necessary.
CASE REPORT: In this article, we present a case of Takayasu arteritis with high-grade stenosis of all the great vessels of the thoracic aorta treated with drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty and stenting requiring multiple follow-up interventions over a 1-year follow-up.
CONCLUSION: The DCB angioplasty is a potential endovascular treatment for thoracic great artery stenosis in Takayasu arteritis that could be further explored.
