Title: CLINICAL AND IMAGING OUTCOMES OF XLIF SURGERY FOR LUMBAR SPINAL STENOSIS.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To evaluate the treatment outcomes of lateral interbody bone graft surgery and posterior percutaneous screws for lumbar spinal stenosis Methods: This is a cross-sectional descriptive study. There were 27 patients with 30 segments of surgery diagnosed with lumbar spinal stenosis that were surgically treated with the XLIF method. Clinical outcomes measured included VAS scores for lower back pain and leg pain, ODI, and JOA scores. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar spine after surgery was used to evaluate indirect decompression. X-ray or CT scan to evaluate bone fusion after 6 months of surgery. Differences were determined by independent T-test.
RESULTS: There were 27 patients with 30 segments of surgery. They were 12 males and 15 females with an average age of 58.81±8.1. There was significant improvement in VAS for lower back pain from 7.11±1.31 to 3.67±1.3, VAS for leg pain from 6.81±2.19 to 1.59±1.89, ODI from 26.41±8.95 to 13.69±8.34, and JOA score from 7.63±2.87 to 13.5±1.73. A-P diameter increased 134%, lateral diameter increased 120%, lateral recess depth increased 166%, disc height increased 126%, foraminal height increased 124%, spinal canal area increased 30%. The p-values were all <0.001. The average hospital stay was 6.79±3.01 days. Complications included 1 pedicle screw malformation, 1 ALL avulsion fracture, 1 abdominal herniation, 1 venous damage, 1 failure.
CONCLUSION: XLIF surgery presents a favorable option for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis. This is a minimally invasive surgical method that reduces pain, reduces bleeding, and is effective in indirectly decompressing the spinal canal both clinal and imaging.
