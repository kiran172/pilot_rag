Title: Effectiveness and safety of high dose clopidogrel plus aspirin in ischemic stroke patients with the single CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele: a randomized trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Dual antiplatelet aggregation therapy leads to better outcomes in patients with carotid artery stenosis, intracranial artery stenosis, minor strokes, or transient ischaemic attacks. However, carriers of the CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele may not experience the desired effects. We attempted to increase the clopidogrel dose to determine whether it would improve the outcomes of stroke patients who carry a single loss-of-function allele.
METHODS: We recruited 131 patients with minor ischaemic stroke, within less than 7 days of stroke onset and a CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele, who had moderate-to-severe cerebral artery stenosis. Patients were divided into the high dose group (clopidogrel 150 mg per day + aspirin 100 mg per day over 21 days.) and a normal dose group (clopidogrel 75 mg per day + aspirin 100 mg per day over 21 days). The reported outcomes included any vascular or major bleeding events as the primary and safety endpoints, respectively.
RESULTS: One and six vascular events occurred in the high dose and normal dose groups during the 3-months follow-up period, respectively. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups when adjusted for history of diabetes (hazard ratio, 5482; 95% confidence interval, 0.660 to 45.543; P = 0.115). No major bleeding events occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with ischaemic stroke who had a single CYP2C19 loss-of-function allele and moderate to severe cerebral stenosis, fewer vascular events occurred within 3 months with high dose of clopidogrel and aspirin than with normal dose of clopidogrel and aspirin. However, the difference between the two groups was not significant.
