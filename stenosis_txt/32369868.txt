Title: Transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve-in-valve implantation with three-dimensional printing guidance: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Valve-in-valve implantation (ViV) has become a valid option for the treatment of bioprosthetic valve failure. We describe the first in-man transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or "turducken" in a patient with previous TAVR within surgical aortic valve replacement with preprocedural guidance utilizing three-dimensional (3D) printing and intraprocedural guidance with fusion imaging.
CASE SUMMARY: A 65-year-old male with a previous valve-in-valve with a transcatheter Melody valve presented with symptomatic severe valvular and paravalvular aortic incompetence. Using 3D printing for preprocedural guidance and computed tomography angiography-fluoroscopy fusion imaging for intraprocedural guidance we successfully placed a 29â€‰mm self-expanding valve with minimal residual gradients. The patient continued to be asymptomatic at 1- and 5-year follow-up.
DISCUSSION: We describe the first in man aortic valve-in-valve-in-valve using preprocedural guidance with 3D printing and intraprocedural guidance with fusion imaging. The valve has continued to demonstrate good function up to 5 years postprocedure suggesting that transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve-in-valve may be feasible with the proper pre- and intraprocedural guidance.
