Title: Antithrombotic Therapy After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: The development of transcatheter aortic valve implantation has represented one of the greatest advances in the cardiology field in recent years and has changed clinical practice for patients with aortic stenosis. Despite the continuous improvement in operators' experience and techniques, and the development of new generation devices, thromboembolic and bleeding complications after transcatheter aortic valve implantation remain frequent, and are a major concern due to their negative impact on prognosis in this vulnerable population. In addition, the optimal antithrombotic regimen in this scenario is not known, and current recommendations are mostly empirical and not evidence based. The present review aims to provide an overview of the current status of knowledge, including relevant on-going randomised trials, on antithrombotic treatment strategies after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
