Title: Aortic Valve Replacement in the Era of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Current Status in Korea.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the era of transcatheter aortic valve implantation, this study was conducted to investigate the current trend of aortic valve procedures in Korea and to evaluate the early and mid-term outcomes of isolated surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) using bioprosthetic valves in contemporary Korea.
METHODS: Contemporary outcomes of isolated bioprosthetic SAVR in Korea were analyzed using the datasets on a multicenter basis. Patients who underwent isolated SAVR using bioprostheses from June 2015 to May 2019 were included, and those with concomitant cardiac procedures, SAVR with mechanical valve, or SAVR for infective endocarditis were excluded. A total of 456 patients from 4 large-volume centers were enrolled in this study. Median follow-up duration was 43.4 months. Early postoperative outcomes, mid-term clinical outcomes, and echocardiographic outcomes were evaluated.
RESULTS: Mean age of the patients was 73.1 ± 7.3 years, and EuroSCORE II was 2.23 ± 2.09. The cardiopulmonary bypass time and aortic cross-clamp times were median 106 and 76 minutes, respectively. SAVR was performed with full median sternotomy (81.8%), right thoracotomy (14.7%), or partial sternotomy (3.5%). Operative mortality was 1.8%. The incidences of stroke and permanent pacemaker implantation were 1.1% and 1.1%, respectively. Paravalvular regurgitation ≥ mild was detected in 2.6% of the patients. Cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality at 5 years was 13.0%. Cumulative incidences of cardiovascular mortality and bioprosthetic valve dysfunction at 5 years were 7.6% and 6.8%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The most recent data for isolated SAVR using bioprostheses in Korea resulted in excellent early and mid-term outcomes in a multicenter study.
