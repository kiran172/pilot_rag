Title: Association between serum lipoprotein(a) and mildly reduced eGFR: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and aortic stenosis. However, the data on the relationship between Lp(a) and mildly reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) has been disputed. This study was conducted to assess the relationship between Lp(a) concentrations and mildly reduced eGFR in healthy subjects.This community-based, cross-sectional study enrolled 1,064 volunteers aged ≥ 40 years who lived in Yonghong Community, Zhonglou District, Changzhou, China, between December 2016 and December 2017. A mildly reduced eGFR was defined as eGFR between 60 and 90 mL/min/1.73m2. A standardized questionnaire and biochemical measurements were used to gather information about participants. The serum concentration of Lp(a) was determined using the latex-enhanced immunoturbidimetric test. Of the total study population, 34.8% (n = 370) were men, and the mean age was 66.8 ± 8.5 years. A significant association existed between Lp(a) levels and the risk of mildly reduced eGFR. Individuals with the highest tertile of Lp(a) had higher odds of mildly reduced eGFR after adjusting for various confounders (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 1.80, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-2.60, P = 0.0025) compared to those with the lowest tertile of Lp(a). Multivariable logistic regression of studies in which Lp(a) was presented as continuous variables showed consistent results (adjusted OR: 1.23 for 1-SD increment of Ln-Lp(a), 95% CI: 1.05-1.43). Subgroup analyses showed that study characteristics such as age, sex, obesity, diabetes, and hypertension status did not significantly affect the association (P for all interactions &gt; 0.05). These results suggest that higher serum Lp(a) level was an independent risk factor for mildly reduced eGFR.
