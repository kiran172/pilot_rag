Title: [Implantation of a fenestriated stent-graft in a patient with thoracic aortic aneurysm].

Abstract: The authors present endovascular treatment of a patient with stenosis of the left anterior descending artery, chronic DeBakey type III aortic dissection and thoracic aortic aneurysm. The first stage was percutaneous coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending artery. The second stage implied implantation of a fenestrated stent-graft. The follow-up CT angiography after 6 months revealed occlusion of the left subclavian artery that required stenting. Control CT angiography confirmed adequate stent-graft placement without endoleaks and stenosis of the artery. The choice of these reconstructions and stages of interventions are substantiated. The authors concluded effectiveness of treatment strategy, as well as the need for preventive subclavian artery stenting after implantation of a fenestrated graft.
