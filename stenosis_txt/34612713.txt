Title: Aortic valve replacement using Konno procedure for prior Yasui procedure.

Abstract: A 2-year-old girl underwent conversion to the Konno procedure by removing the Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis after the neonatal Yasui procedure for an interrupted aortic arch with left ventricular outflow tract stenosis. Her postoperative course was uneventful. However, left ventricular outflow tract restenosis occurred due to narrowed ventricular septal defect and moderate neoaortic regurgitation from the old pulmonary valve. The Konno procedure was performed by removing the Damus-Kaye-Stansel anastomosis for left ventricular outflow tract restenosis and neoaortic regurgitation and performing right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction and ventricular septal defect closure. Left ventricular outflow tract restenosis was not observed.
