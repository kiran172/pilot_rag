Title: Complete revascularization optimizes patient outcomes in multivessel coronary artery disease: Data from the e-Ultimaster registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to assess the effect of the coronary revascularization strategy during index admission on clinical outcomes among patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD).
BACKGROUND: The value of complete revascularization (CR) over incomplete revascularization (IR) in MVD patients is not fully established.
METHODS: Patients with MVD defined as ≥2 major epicardial vessels with ≥50% stenosis were selected from the observational all-comer e-Ultimaster registry. Patients were treated with a sirolimus-eluting thin-strut coronary stent. Completeness of revascularization was physician assessed at the index procedure or an eventually staged procedure during the index hospitalization. Outcomes measures at 1 year were target lesion failure (TLF) (composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction [MI], and clinically driven target lesion revascularization [TLR]), and patient-oriented composite endpoint (POCE) (all-cause mortality, MI, or revascularization). The inverse probability of treatment weights (IPTW) methodology was used to perform a matched analysis.
RESULTS: The registry recruited 37,198 patients of whom 15,441 (41.5%) had MVD. CR on hospital discharge was achieved in 7413 (48.0%) patients and IR in 8028 (52.0%) patients. Mean age was 64.6 ± 11.1 versus 65.7 ± 11.0 years (p < 0.01), male gender 77.9% and 77.3% (p = 0.41) and diabetes 31.3% versus 33.4% (p = 0.01) for CR and IR, respectively. Chronic stable angina patients more commonly underwent CR (47.6% vs. 36.8%, p < 0.01). After propensity weighted analysis, 90.5% of CR patients were angina-free at 1 year compared with 87.5% of IR patients (p < 0.01). TLF (3.3% vs. 4.4%; p < 0.01), POCE (6.8% vs. 10.8%; p < .01), and all-cause mortality (2.3% vs. 3.1%; p < .01) were all lower in CR patients.
CONCLUSIONS: A physician-directed use of a CR strategy utilizing sirolimus-eluting thin-strut stent results in optimized clinical outcomes and less angina in an all-comer population. Our findings suggest that a CR should be aimed for.
