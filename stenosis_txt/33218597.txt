Title: Robotic Ureteral Reconstruction.

Abstract: Robotically assisted laparoscopic techniques may be used for proximal and distal ureteral strictures. Distal strictures may be approached with ureteroneocystotomy, psoas hitch, and Boari flap. Ureteroureterostomy, buccal mucosa graft ureteroplasty, and appendiceal flap ureteroplasty are viable techniques for strictures anywhere along the ureter. Ileal ureteral substitution is reserved for more extensive disease, and autotransplantation is reserved for salvage situations.
