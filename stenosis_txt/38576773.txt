Title: Hybrid Stenting of Pulmonary Venous Baffle Stenosis: Subxiphoid Approach in Transposition of the Great Arteries.

Abstract: A 31-year-old woman with transposition of the great arteries status post-Senning operation presents with severe pulmonary venous baffle obstruction. Both standards of care (percutaneous stenting or open repair) were deemed suboptimal and/or high risk. A multidisciplinary, hybrid approach via subxiphoid incision, guided by 3-dimensional modeling, provided a lower risk and minimally invasive intervention.
