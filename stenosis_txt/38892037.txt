Title: Adenosine in Interventional Cardiology: Physiopathologic and Pharmacologic Effects in Coronary Artery Disease.

Abstract: This review article focuses on the role of adenosine in coronary artery disease (CAD) diagnosis and treatment. Adenosine, an endogenous purine nucleoside, plays crucial roles in cardiovascular physiology and pathology. Its release and effects, mediated by specific receptors, influence vasomotor function, blood pressure regulation, heart rate, and platelet activity. Adenosine therapeutic effects include treatment of the no-reflow phenomenon and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. The production of adenosine involves complex cellular pathways, with extracellular and intracellular synthesis mechanisms. Adenosine's rapid metabolism underscores its short half-life and physiological turnover. Furthermore, adenosine's involvement in side effects of antiplatelet therapy, particularly ticagrelor and cangrelor, highlights its clinical significance. Moreover, adenosine serves as a valuable tool in CAD diagnosis, aiding stress testing modalities and guiding intracoronary physiological assessments. Its use in assessing epicardial stenosis and microvascular dysfunction is pivotal for treatment decisions. Overall, understanding adenosine's mechanisms and clinical implications is essential for optimizing CAD management strategies, encompassing both therapeutic interventions and diagnostic approaches.
