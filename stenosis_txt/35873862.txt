Title: Serial changes of coronary flow reserve over one year after transcatheter aortic valve implantation in patients with severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Impaired coronary flow reserve (CFR) portends a poor prognosis in patients with aortic stenosis. The present study aims to investigate how CFR changes over one year after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in patients with severe aortic stenosis, and to explore factors related to the changes.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVI were registered. CFR in the left anterior descending artery was measured by transthoracic echocardiography on three occasions pre-TAVI, one-day post-TAVI, and one-year post-TAVI.
RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled, 46 of whom completed one-year follow-up. CFR was impaired in 35 (59.3%) patients pre-TAVI, but the impairment was only seen in 2 patients (4%) one-year post-TAVI. CFR value improved from 1.75 (1.50-2.10) cm/s pre-TAVI, to 2.00 (1.70-2.30) one-day post-TAVI, and further to 2.60 (2.30-3.10) one-year post-TAVI (P &lt; 0.001). The median difference in CFR between pre-TAVI and one-year post-TAVI was 0.90 (0.53-1.20). Patients with significant improvement of CFR (more than the median value of 0.9) had larger aortic valve area (1.55 [1.38-1.92] vs. 1.36 cm2 [1.26-1.69], P = 0.042) and greater improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (3.10 [-1.67-4.24] vs. -1.46 [-3.42-1.48] percentage points, P = 0.019) than those without.
CONCLUSIONS: CFR is impaired in a considerable proportion of patients with severe aortic stenosis, but improvement is seen immediately after TAVI, and one year later. Patients with significant improvement of CFR had larger aortic valve area and greater increase in left ventricular ejection fraction after TAVI.
