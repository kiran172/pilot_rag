Title: A case report of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum: an extraordinary finding of subsystemic right ventricle.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Massive tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is the most common feature of pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS), and mild or absent TR is observed in severe right ventricular (RV) dysplasia or RV-to-coronary fistulous connections, resulting in non-biventricular (BV) outcomes postnatally.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a case of fetal severe pulmonary stenosis with IVS diagnosed at 26 weeks of gestation. The severity of RV hypoplasia did not worsen or reach indications for intrauterine intervention, while the jet velocity of TR decreased significantly during pregnancy. The fetus was definitely diagnosed with PA/IVS with mild RV dysplasia after birth. Unusually, the fetus did not experience severe TR and myocardial sinusoids, the TR jet velocity was maintained at 2.0â€…m/s, and the coronary artery was almost normal. The incapable RV cannot pump blood into pulmonary circulation after RV decompression from valvular perforation and balloon dilation. It may be an extraordinary finding of subsystemic RV.
CONCLUSION: PA/IVS is a heterogeneous disease with various degrees of RV dysplasia. Mild or no baseline TR is a reliable indicator with non-BV outcomes for fetal PA/IVS, even with acceptable dysplasia RV structures.
