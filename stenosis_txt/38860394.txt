Title: Lipoprotein(a), Oxidized Phospholipids, and Progression to Symptomatic Heart Failure: The CASABLANCA Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Higher lipoprotein(a) and oxidized phospholipid concentrations are associated with increased risk for coronary artery disease and valvular heart disease. The role of lipoprotein(a) or oxidized phospholipid as a risk factor for incident heart failure (HF) or its complications remains uncertain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 1251 individuals referred for coronary angiography in the Catheter Sampled Blood Archive in Cardiovascular Diseases (CASABLANCA) study were stratified on the basis of universal definition of HF stage; those in stage A/B (N=714) were followed up for an average 3.7 years for incident stage C/D HF or the composite of HF/cardiovascular death. During follow-up, 105 (14.7%) study participants in stage A/B progressed to symptomatic HF and 57 (8.0%) had cardiovascular death. In models adjusted for multiple HF risk factors, including severe coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis, individuals with lipoprotein(a) ≥150 nmol/L were at higher risk for progression to symptomatic HF (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90 [95% CI, 1.15-3.13]; P=0.01) or the composite of HF/cardiovascular death (HR, 1.71 [95% CI, 1.10-2.67]; P=0.02). These results remained significant after further adjustment of the model to include prior myocardial infarction (HF: HR, 1.89, P=0.01; HF/cardiovascular death: HR, 1.68, P=0.02). Elevated oxidized phospholipid concentrations were similarly associated with risk, particularly when added to higher lipoprotein(a). In Kaplan-Meier analyses, individuals with stage A/B HF and elevated lipoprotein(a) had shorter time to progression to stage C/D HF or HF/cardiovascular death (both log-rank P&lt;0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals with stage A or B HF, higher lipoprotein(a) and oxidized phospholipid concentrations are independent risk factors for progression to symptomatic HF or cardiovascular death.
