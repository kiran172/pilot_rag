Title: Screening for irradiation vasculopathy by intima-media thickness sonography in head and neck cancer patients.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Post-irradiation vasculopathy is a severe form of atherosclerosis and affects the prognosis of head and neck cancer survivors. Sonographic intima-media thickness (IMT) precedes stenosis, plaque formation, and cerebrovascular events. Therefore, IMT may be a valuable screening marker for post-irradiation toxicity. However, the critical irradiation dose and the onset of IMT increase remain unclear.
METHODS: The cross-sectional study analysed the carotid artery IMT in 96 irradiated patients and 41 controls regarding irradiation dose, post-irradiation-interval, and cardiovascular risk factors. Distinct irradiation doses to the tumour side and the contralateral hemineck enabled detection of dose depended effects within one patient and control of risk factors.
RESULTS: Radiotherapy caused a dose-dependent increase in IMT. The toxicity did not have saturation effects for > 60 Gy. The IMT increase occurred in short-term following radiotherapy and the risk for a pathological value (> 0.9 mm) rose significantly. The correlation between IMT and radiotherapy was comparable to established cardiovascular risk factors.
CONCLUSION: Radiotherapists should consider the additional toxicity of high doses for non-metastatic head and neck cancer. If neck metastases require radiotherapy with boost, IMT measurement is suitable for early detection of carotid artery damage.
