Title: Neural Regenerative Potential of Stem Cells Derived from the Tooth Apical Papilla.

Abstract: The regenerative effects of stem cells derived from dental tissues have been previously investigated. This study assessed the potential of human tooth stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP) on nerve regeneration. The SCAP collected from nine individuals were characterized and polarized by exposure to interferon-γ (IFN-γ). IFN-γ increased kynurenine and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by SCAP, without affecting the cell viability. IFN-γ-primed SCAP exhibited a decrease of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA levels, followed by an upregulation of glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor mRNA. Ex vivo, the co-culture of SCAP with neurons isolated from the rat dorsal root ganglion induced neurite outgrowth, accompanied by increased BDNF secretion, irrespective of IFN-γ priming. In vivo, the local application of SCAP reduced the mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in Wistar rats that had been submitted to sciatic chronic constriction injury. The SCAP also reduced the pain scores, according to the evaluation of the Grimace scale, partially restoring the myelin damage and BDNF immunopositivity secondary to nerve lesion. Altogether, our results provide novel evidence about the regenerative effects of human SCAP, indicating their potential to handle nerve injury-related complications.
