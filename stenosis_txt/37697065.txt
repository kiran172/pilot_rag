Title: Association between the triglyceride-glucose index and calcified aortic stenosis in elderly patients: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: Insulin resistance (IR) is associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases, but there are few studies on the correlation between IR and calcified aortic stenosis (CAS). In this study, the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, which reflects IR, was used to investigate the correlation between IR and CAS. The study included 183 elderly patients who were diagnosed with CAS by transthoracic echocardiography. The patients were matched 1:1 according to age and sex, and elderly patients who were hospitalized during the same period and underwent transthoracic echocardiography without aortic stenosis were included as the control group. The relationship between the TyG index and CAS was analyzed by a multivariable logistic regression model, curve fitting and trend test. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the TyG index as a continuous variable was negatively associated with CAS (P < 0.001); trend tests and curve fitting further supported this association. Our study showed that the TyG index was negatively associated with CAS in elderly patients, which may be related to the impairment of insulin receptors and signaling pathways in IR.
