Title: Immediate, Short-Term, Intermediate, and Long-Term Clinical Outcomes of True Bifurcation Stenting.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Coronary artery bifurcation lesion is an epicardial stenosis that, when compared to non-bifurcation lesions, poses a greater risk of adverse events and can compromise prognosis. This study aims to investigate the clinical efficacy of different stenting techniques, particularly in terms of their immediate, short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes in patients with true bifurcation lesions.
METHODOLOGY: This retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in a tertiary cardiac hospital in Islamabad, from February 1, 2015, to February 28, 2021. A total of 172 patients who met the inclusion criteria and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention were selected using a consecutive sampling technique. Follow-up was maintained for three years to assess procedural outcomes.
RESULTS: Of the 172 participants, the majority were males (69%) and only 4% were above 75 years of age. A significant relation between major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and previous percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (p < 0.000) was observed. Procedural success was good in all patients using the drug-eluting stent. The MAC rate was 6.9% and the final kissing balloon inflation, stenting technique, and bifurcation involvement were significantly associated with MACE occurrence (p < 0.01), and mortality was reported in two patients (1.16%). MACEs were associated with mortality; previous PCI and hypertension increased the risk of mortality.
CONCLUSION: The two-stent strategy can be used with good long-term outcomes and low complication rates.
