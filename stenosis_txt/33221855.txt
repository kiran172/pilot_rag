Title: Prognostic importance of the transmitral pressure gradient in mitral annular calcification with associated mitral valve dysfunction.

Abstract: AIMS: The aim of this study was to define the natural history of patients with mitral annular calcification (MAC)-related mitral valve dysfunction and to assess the prognostic importance of mean transmitral pressure gradient (MG) and impact of concomitant mitral regurgitation (MR).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The institutional echocardiography database was examined from 2001 to 2019 for all patients with MAC and MG ≥3 mmHg. A total of 5754 patients were stratified by MG in low (3-5 mmHg, n = 3927), mid (5-10 mmHg, n = 1476), and high (≥10 mmHg, n = 351) gradient. The mean age was 78 ± 11 years, and 67% were female. MR was none/trace in 32%, mild in 42%, moderate in 23%, and severe in 3%. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and outcome models were adjusted for age, sex, and MAC-related risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease). Survival at 1, 5, and 10 years was 77%, 42%, and 18% in the low-gradient group; 73%, 38%, and 17% in the mid-gradient group; and 67%, 25%, and 11% in the high-gradient group, respectively (log-rank P < 0.001 between groups). MG was independently associated with mortality (adjusted HR 1.064 per 1 mmHg increase, 95% CI 1.049-1.080). MR severity was associated with mortality at low gradients (P < 0.001) but not at higher gradients (P = 0.166 and 0.372 in the mid- and high-gradient groups, respectively).
CONCLUSION: In MAC-related mitral valve dysfunction, mean transmitral gradient is associated with increased mortality after adjustment for age, sex, and MAC-related risk factors. Concomitant MR is associated with excess mortality in low-gradient ranges (3-5 mmHg) but gradually loses prognostic importance at higher gradients, indicating prognostic utility of transmitral gradient in MAC regardless of MR severity.
