Title: Traumatic cervical vertebral artery dissection: A case with cerebral infarct due to newly formed thrombus in the cerebral arteries.

Abstract: We report a 50-year-old man who developed fatal brainstem infarction fiveâ€‰days after traumatic cervical vertebral artery dissection (CVAD). Autopsy revealed multiple fresh infarcts in the territory of the vertebrobasilar system. No thrombus was found in the infarct lesions. The cervical vertebral artery (CVA) showed severe atherosclerotic stenosis extending to the proximal half of the left side, similar stenosis at the origin on the right side, fresh thrombotic occlusion extending to the proximal half of the right side, and multiple dissections in the distal foraminal segments on both sides. In the distal half of the basilar artery (BA) and the origin of the right posterior cerebral artery (PCA), the lumen was extensively filled with fresh thrombus. Although an intricate mixture of white and red thrombi filled the lumen at the origin of the right PCA, the white thrombus gradually appeared at the periphery whereas the red thrombus occupied the central and more proximal part of the BA. We confirm that cerebral infarction associated with CVAD is due not only to emboli originating from the dislodged thrombus at sites of arterial dissection, as reported previously, but also to newly formed thrombus in the cerebral arteries caused by impaired blood flow, as was seen in the present case.
