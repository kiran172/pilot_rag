Title: Factors affecting return to work following endoscopic lumbar foraminal stenosis surgery: A single-center series.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluates the factors affecting the return to work of endoscopic surgery for lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS), including symptoms, functional status, complications, and reoperation rates.
METHODS: The authors' retrospective cohort study included 100 consecutive patients (50 males and 50 females) diagnosed with LFS who underwent endoscopic surgery at Trotsky National Research Center of Surgery between January 2018 and December 2021.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in age and preoperative visual analog scale and Oswestry disability index scores between the male and female groups, time to return to work for different patient groups after undergoing endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy (ELF). However, patients with more severe stenosis and comorbidities may take longer to recover. Confounding factors were patient age, preoperative physical function, and job requirements.
CONCLUSION: This study confirms that study ELF can effectively improve symptoms associated with lumbar radiculopathy, as well as back pain, and improve patients' quality of life. Comorbidity, smoking status, and complications prolong the time to return to work following ELF surgery compared to healthy subjects.
