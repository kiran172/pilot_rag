Title: [Intervention principles for complications of arteriovenous graft].

Abstract: Stenosis, thrombosis, and infection are major complications of arteriovenous graft (AVG). Endovascular therapy is usually adopted for stenosis, while bypass, interposition, patch angioplasty and other surgical techniques can also be used for special sites. Interventions of AVG thrombosis include removal of thrombus and treatment of the underlying stenosis. The former includes catheter directed thrombolysis, endovascular intervention, surgical treatment, or hybrid treatment. Etiological detection before the application of empirical antibiotics is the first step of infection management. According to different infection ranges, partial graft excision and interposition, total graft excision and partial graft excision can be performed respectively. Active prevention, timely identification, and appropriate intervention of the complications can improve the long-term outcomes of AVG. Personalized interventional strategy should be employed based on the systemic evaluation.
