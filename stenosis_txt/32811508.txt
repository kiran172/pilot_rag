Title: Treatment for lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy using percutaneous endoscopy through interlaminar approach: a retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This paper is to describe percutaneous endoscopy in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy targeted and to investigate the efficacy and safety of percutaneous endoscopy in the treatment of this kind of lumbar spinal stenosis in elderly patients.
METHOD: A retrospective analysis of 40 elderly patients with lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy admitted between January 2016 and January 2018 was performed. According to different surgical methods, they were divided into two groups: the control group and the endoscopy group (interlaminar approach), 20 people per group. There were 9 males and 11 females in the control group; the age of patients was 65.65 ± 4.44 years, and the average disease duration was 4.55 ± 1.85 years. Besides, there were 10 males and 10 females in the endoscopy group; the age of patients was 67.30 ± 4.23 years, and the average disease duration was 4.95 ± 2.04 years. Collect and count surgical-related indicators, preoperative and postoperative radiologic findings, incision visual analog scale (VAS), lumbar and leg pain VAS, lumbar Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA), and Oswestry disability index (ODI) scores of all patients.
RESULT: A series of surgical indicators (including the operation time, the quantity of bleeding, and postoperative hospital stay) in the endoscopy group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < 0.05). The incision VAS score in the endoscopy group was also significantly lower than that in the control group at each time after surgery (p < 0.05). Besides, compared with the control group, in the endoscopy group, the leg pain VAS score and lumbar ODI score after surgery were significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Compared with the control group, in the endoscopy group, the lumbar JOA score was significantly higher (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSION: Percutaneous endoscopic technique is a small trauma, quick recovery, safe, and effective minimally invasive surgery for patients with lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to ligamentum flavum hypertrophy.
