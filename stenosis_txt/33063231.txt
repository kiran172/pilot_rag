Title: Bovine Pericardium of High Fibre Dispersion Has High Fatigue Life and Increased Collagen Content; Potentially an Untapped Source of Heart Valve Leaflet Tissue.

Abstract: Bioprosthetic heart valves (BHVs) are implanted in aortic valve stenosis patients to replace the native, dysfunctional valve. Yet, the long-term performance of the glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium (GLBP) leaflets is known to reduce device durability. The aim of this study was to investigate a type of commercial-grade GLBP which has been over-looked in the literature to date; that of high collagen fibre dispersion (HD). Under uniaxial cyclic loading conditions, it was observed that the fatigue behaviour of HD GLBP was substantially equivalent to GLBP in which the fibres are highly aligned along the loading direction. It was also found that HD GLBP had a statistically significant 9.5% higher collagen content when compared to GLBP with highly aligned collagen fibres. The variability in diseased BHV delivery sites results in unpredictable and complex loading patterns across leaflets in vivo. This study presents the possibility of a shift from the traditional choice of circumferentially aligned GLBP leaflets, to that of high fibre dispersion arrangements. Characterised by its high fatigue life and increased collagen content, in addition to multiple fibre orientations, GLBP of high fibre dispersion may provide better patient outcomes under the multi-directional loading to which BHV leaflets are subjected in vivo.
