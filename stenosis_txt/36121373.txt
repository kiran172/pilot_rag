Title: Early Diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease by Inflammatory Biomarkers of Atherosclerosis in Patients with Angina.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with chest pain is a challenge. Currently diagnosis of CAD is confirmed by coronary angiography, which is invasive and not easily available in developing countries. Therefore, it is imperative to establish noninvasive biomarker for early diagnosis of CAD in patients with angina and determine the diagnostic accuracy of inflammatory biomarkers of atherosclerosis in comparison to angiography and correlate with severity of CAD in patients with angina. Diagnostic accuracy study was carried out in tertiary care hospitals, Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Total of 58 patients aged 55.24 ± 11.61 years, with chest pain and troponin-I -ve, having coronary artery stenosis ≥50% were included as cases of CAD and 55 subjects having stenosis &lt;50% were included as controls. Nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were analyzed on immunoassay analyzers. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed significant (P &lt; 0.05) high area under curve (95% confidence interval) with sensitivity and specificity of NF-κB 0.76 (0.65-0.85), 73% and 65%; TNF-α 0.72 (0.61-0.81), 71% and 69%; IL-6 0.62 (0.52-0.71), 64% and 53% and hs-CRP 0.62 (0.52-0.71), and 53% and 56% in CAD patients compared to controls. There was significant positive correlation between NF-κB (r = 0.44), TNF-α (r = 0.37), IL-6 (r = 0.23), and hs-CRP (r = 0.23) with severity of CAD by Gensini score. The inflammatory biomarkers, especially NF-κB and TNF-α, have highest diagnostic accuracy and indicate severity of atherosclerosis in patients with angina. These markers may be used as noninvasive biomarkers to exclude healthy individuals before undergoing angiography.
