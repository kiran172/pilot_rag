Title: Mid-term outcomes of tricuspid annuloplasty using the Tri-Ad Adams tricuspid annuloplasty ring.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The Tri-Ad Adams tricuspid annuloplasty ring is a recent innovative prosthesis characterized by a semi-rigid central component and fully flexible extremities. The goal of this study was to assess the short-term and mid-term results following implantation of the Tri-Ad Adams ring.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients who underwent tricuspid annuloplasty using the Tri-Ad Adams ring between August 2016 and October 2021.
RESULTS: Our study enrolled a total of 248 participants. The median age was 64.0 (interquartile range: 56.0-71.5) years. The median EuroSCORE II was 4.3% (2.7-7.5%), with 37 patients (14.9%) having a history of cardiac operations. Tricuspid regurgitation of grade 2-3 was observed in 63.7% of cases, and the median tricuspid annular diameter was 3.3 (2.8-3.6) cm. Concurrent procedures included mitral valve replacement (n = 160, 64.5%), mitral valve repair (n = 75, 30.2%), aortic valve replacement (n = 72, 29.0%) and the maze procedure (n = 170, 68.5%). Immediate postoperative tricuspid regurgitation≥moderate was present in 1 patient (0.4%). Early death occurred in 14 patients (5.6%). Major complications included low cardiac output syndrome (n = 18, 0.3%), acute kidney injury (n = 14, 5.6%) and permanent pacemaker placement (n = 15, 6.0%). According to the Kaplan-Meier analysis, the 4-year rates of freedom from overall mortality and moderate-to-severe tricuspid regurgitation were 96.9% and 91.6%, respectively. There were no incidents of tricuspid valve reoperations, ring detachment or significant tricuspid stenosis (trans-tricuspid valve gradient ≥ 5 mmHg).
CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid annuloplasty utilizing the Tri-Ad Adams ring demonstrated favourable outcomes in both the early and midterm periods. Further studies are warranted to confirm the long-term results.
