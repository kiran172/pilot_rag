Title: A case report: new-onset nummular headache after stenting of the middle cerebral artery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Nummular headache (NH) is categorized as a primary headache in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, Third edition (ICHD-3) diagnostic criteria, but there are secondary etiologies as well. We present a case of secondary NH that associated with vascular lesion.
CASE PRESENTATION: We report on a 40-year-old man with a medical history of symptomatic intracranial arterial stenosis who developed a headache after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting because of Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis(ICAS). This new-onset headache was a pinprick headache confined to the parietal part of the head and 5Â cm in size. This headache most closely resembled the phenotype of a NH. And other causes of secondary headache were excluded. Thus, the diagnosis of NH was highly speculated. This patient represents a rare headache phenomenon after intracranial arterial stent placement.
CONCLUSION: This is the first report of NH after stent placement treatment in a patient with ICAS.
