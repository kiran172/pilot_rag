Title: A comparison study on patient-reported outcome between obese and non-obese patients with central lumbar spinal stenosis undergoing surgical decompression: 14,984 patients in the National Swedish Quality Registry for Spine Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Obesity has been associated with inferior outcomes after laminectomy due to central lumbar spinal stenosis (CLSS); we evaluated whether this occurs in surgery on national bases.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrieved pre- and 1-year postoperative data from the National Swedish Quality Registry for Spine Surgery regarding patients aged â‰¥ 50 with laminectomy due to CLSS in 2005-2018. 4,069 patients had normal weight, 7,044 were overweight, 3,377 had class I obesity, 577 class II obesity, and 94 class III obesity ("morbid obesity"). Patient-reported outcome included satisfaction after 1 year, leg pain (Numerical Rating Scale [NRS], rating 0-10), disability (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI], rating 0-100). Complications were also retrieved.
RESULTS: 1-year postoperatively, 69% of patient of normal weight, 67% who were overweight, and 62% with obesity (classes I-III aggregated) were satisfied (p < 0.001) and 62%, 60%, and 57% in obese groups I-III, respectively (p = 0.7). NRS leg pain improved in normal-weight patients by 3.5 (95% CI 3.4-3.6), overweight by 3.2 (CI 3.1-3.2), and obese by 2.6 (CI 2.5-2.7), and 2.8 (CI 2.7-2.9), 2.5 (CI 2.2-2.7), and 2.6 (CI 2.0-3.2) in obese classes I-III, respectively. ODI improved in normal weight by 19 (CI 19-20), overweight by 17 (CI 17-18), and obese by 14 (CI 13-15), and 16 (CI 15-17), 14 (CI 13-16), 14 (CI 11-18) in obese classes I-III, respectively. 8.1% of normal weight, 7.0% of overweight, and 8.1% of obese patients suffered complications (p = 0.04) and 8.1%, 7.0%, and 17% among obese classes I-III, respectively (p < 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Most obese patients are satisfied after laminectomy due to CLSS, even if satisfaction rate is inferior compared with normal-weight patients. The morbidly obese have more complications than patients with lower BMI.
