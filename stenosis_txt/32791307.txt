Title: Anticoagulation reduces iliocaval and iliofemoral stent thrombosis in patients with cancer stented for nonthrombotic venous obstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To identify factors associated with venous stent thrombosis in patients with cancer treated for nonthrombotic iliocaval or iliofemoral venous obstruction.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of relevant imaging and medical records from 30 consecutive patients with cancer treated at a single center who underwent venous stent placement for nonthrombotic iliocaval or iliofemoral venous obstruction between 2008 and 2018. Follow-up imaging was used to assess stent patency. Variables examined included patient demographics, cancer type, stent characteristics, anticoagulant, and antiplatelet medications and complications of treatment.
RESULTS: Overall primary stent patency was 83% (25/30). The median follow-up period was 44 days (range, 3-365 days). Ten percent of patients occluded owing to in-stent thrombosis and 7% owing to tumor compression of the stent without thrombosis. Therapeutic poststent anticoagulation with enoxaparin, warfarin, or a factor Xa inhibitor was initiated in 87% of the patients. Stent thrombosis occurred in one patient in the anticoagulation group (4%) at 50 days. Stent thrombosis occurred in two patients in the nonanticoagulation group (50%), one at 9 days and the other at 91 days. Anticoagulation was found to be protective against stent thrombosis in this population (hazard ratio, 0.015; P = .011). No statistically significant associations were found among the remaining variables. One patient in the anticoagulation group experienced major bleeding (1/26 [4%]).
CONCLUSIONS: Iliocaval and iliofemoral stent placement for nonthrombotic malignant venous obstruction is safe with favorable primary patency rates. Therapeutic anticoagulation is associated with less stent thrombosis in patients with cancer stented for nonthrombotic iliocaval and iliofemoral venous obstruction.
