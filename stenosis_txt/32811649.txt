Title: Outcomes of Patients with Severe Aortic Stenosis and Left Ventricular Obstruction Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Scarce data exist on clinical features and prognosis of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), concomitant with left ventricular obstruction (LVO). We aimed to evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, and outcomes in patients with severe AS and LVO undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Consecutive patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI between January 2013 to December 2017 at our institution were included. Significant LVO was defined as resting peak left ventricular (LV) systolic gradient ≥30 mm Hg on pre-TAVI echocardiography. We analyzed the primary composite outcome of all-cause mortality and rehospitalization for heart failure (HHF) at 1-year in patients with LVO and those without LVO in the overall and propensity-matched populations. Among 1,729 patients who underwent TAVI, significant LVO was observed in 31 (1.8%) patients. This group was more likely to be female, had smaller aortic annulus and LV cavity, and received a smaller size of the transcatheter heart valve. The most common phenotype of LV hypertrophy causing LVO was concentric LV hypertrophy (58%), and mid-LV obstruction was more common than LV outflow tract obstruction (77% vs 23%, respectively). After adjustment for baseline differences, the primary outcome was not significantly different between patients with LVO and those without LVO (15% vs 16%, respectively; hazard ratio: 0.83; 95% confidence interval: 0.19 to 3.72; p = 0.809). In conclusion, in patients undergoing TAVI, concomitant LVO was relatively uncommon and occurred more often at mid-LV. The presence of pre-TAVI LVO was not associated with worse outcomes defined as increase all-cause mortality or HHF at 1-year.
