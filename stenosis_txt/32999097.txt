Title: Transvalvular Gradients for Balloon-Expandable and Self-Expanding Valves.

Abstract: Self-expanding valves have been associated with superior hemodynamics versus balloon-expandable valves. Our aim was to compare invasive gradients between valve types for similarly sized valves. Patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) at the Malcom Randall Veterans Affairs Medical Center and the Bern University Hospital were considered for this analysis. From 1623 subjects who underwent TAVR, a total of 566 had available invasive hemodynamic data. After applying exclusion criteria, we included 499 for analysis. With immediate invasive hemodynamic assessment, balloon- expandable valves were associated with similar/marginally lower transvalvular gradients versus self-expanding valves. With postoperative echocardiography within 24 hours, self-expanding valves were associated with lower Doppler gradients versus balloon-expandable valves for all size categories.
