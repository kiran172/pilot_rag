Title: Prevalence of Branch Pulmonary Artery Reintervention Following the Arterial Switch Operation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The arterial switch operation (ASO) is the preferred surgical procedure used to correct dextro-transposition of the great arteries. A known complication of the ASO is branch pulmonary arteries (PAs) stenosis, which may require reintervention. Our goal is to determine the frequency of reintervention after the ASO and any factors associated with reintervention.
METHODS: This was a single center, retrospective study of infants who underwent the ASO from June 6, 2011 to February 21, 2021. The primary outcome was the prevalence of reintervention on the PAs following the ASO.
RESULTS: Sixty-eight infants were analyzed; 9 (13%) patients had 10 reinterventions. The mean age at time of the ASO was 6.52 ± 6.63 days; weight was 3.34 ± 0.57 kg. Those with a reintervention had a longer bypass time (P = .047). Mean age at reintervention was 0.80 ± 0.72 years; mean time from the ASO to reintervention was 0.799 ± 0.717 years. Six surgical procedures, two stent placements, and four balloon angioplasties were performed on a total of 13 branch PAs. There was no increased risk for reintervention on the right versus left PA. After reintervention, there was an improvement in the minimal PA diameter and echo gradient. There were no adverse events or mortality related to the reintervention. Mean follow-up was 6.17 ± 2.94 years.
CONCLUSION: The prevalence of branch PA reintervention following the ASO in our cohort was 13%. There is an association between longer cardiopulmonary bypass time and reintervention. After reintervention, there was an increase in PA diameter and a decrease in echo gradient.
