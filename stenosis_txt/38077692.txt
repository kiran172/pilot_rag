Title: Technical feasibility of combined uniportal unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression and interlaminar lumbar discectomy surgery for cauda equina syndrome due to lower lumbar disc herniation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Traditionally, open wide laminectomy and discectomy have been advocated for the treatment of cauda equina syndrome caused by lumbar disc herniation. We aimed to evaluate the technical feasibility of uniportal interlaminar endoscopy in treating cauda equina syndrome.
METHODS: Nine patients with cauda equina syndrome underwent uniportal endoscopic decompression and discectomy from December 2020 to December 2022. Data were collected retrospectively. Patients diagnosed with cauda equina syndrome were operated on within 6 hours of presentation to the hospital. The visual analogue score (VAS), Oswestry disability index (ODI), and bladder/bowel score were used to measure the outcome.
RESULTS: Analysis showed that VAS scores for leg pain and back pain significantly decreased from preoperative scores of 8.22±0.79 and 4.67±1.76 to postoperative day 1 scores of 0.67±0.67 and 2.56±1.42 (p<.05). The ODI scores improved from preoperative 52.33±11.93 to postoperative (day 1) 14±6.80. Eight patients had early recovery (1 week) of bladder and bowel functions, and one had delayed recovery at 8 months. None of the patients had a residual bowel/bladder deficit. Macnab's criteria outcomes were excellent in all patients at the final follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: Uniportal endoscopic lumbar endoscopic unilateral laminotomy with bilateral decompression and subsequent interlaminar endoscopic lumbar discectomy is a safe and effective minimally invasive course of treatment for cauda equina syndrome as an alternative to open laminectomy in our cohort of patients.
