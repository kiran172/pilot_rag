Title: Subclinical Leaflet Thrombosis Following Surgical and Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: A Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Subclinical leaflets valve thrombosis (SLT) is a recently identified phenomenon with multidetector computer tomography after tissue aortic valve replacement. Whether SLT is more frequent after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is currently not known. Thus, the aim of this pairwise meta-analysis was to investigate the incidence of SLT after both TAVR and SAVR, the association with anticoagulation therapy, and the risk for neurological events. We searched PubMed, Google Scholar, and Ovid MEDLINE/Embase (January 02, 2023, last update) (PROSPERO registration: CRD42022383295). Statistical analysis was performed according to a prespecified statistical analysis plan. Time-to-event outcomes were summarized as incidence rate ratios (IRR). Pooled estimates were calculated using inverse variance method and random effect model. Overall, 2 registries, 2 randomized trials, and 1 observational study (1,593 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence rate at follow-up of SLT between patients who underwent TAVR and SAVR (IRR 2.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.06; 4.03], I2 79%, 95% CI: [44; 92], p = 0.03). Oral anticoagulation therapy was associated with a reduced incidence of SLT (IRR 7.51, 95% CI: [3.24; 17.37], I2 62%, 95% CI: [0; 87], p &lt;0.001). However, the incidence of later neurological events did not differ between patients with or without SLT (IRR 1.05, 95% CI: [0.32; 3.47], p = 0.93). In conclusion, SLT was more frequently detected after TAVR than SAVR. However, it was not associated with an increased risk for neurological events. Oral anticoagulation therapy seemed to reduce the incidence of SLT.
