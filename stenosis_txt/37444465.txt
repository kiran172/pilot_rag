Title: Epidemiological Study of Malignant Paediatric Liver Tumours in Denmark 1985-2020.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Malignant liver tumours in children are rare and national outcomes for this tumour entity are rarely published. This study mapped paediatric liver tumours in Denmark over 35 years and reported on the incidence, outcomes and long-term adverse events.
METHODS: We identified all liver tumours from the Danish Childhood Cancer Registry and reviewed the case records for patient and tumour characteristics, treatment and clinical outcome.
RESULTS: We included 79 patients in the analyses. Overall crude incidence was ~2.29 per 1 million children (<15 yr) per year, with 61 hepatoblastomas (HB), 9 hepatocellular carcinomas and 9 other hepatic tumours. Overall 5-year survival was 84%, 78% and 44%, respectively. Nine patients had underlying liver disease or predisposition syndrome. Seventeen children underwent liver transplantation, with two late complications, biliary stenosis and liver fibrosis. For HB, age â‰¥ 8 years and diagnosis prior to 2000 were significant predictors of a poorer outcome. Adverse events included reduced renal function in 10%, reduced cardiac function in 6% and impaired hearing function in 60% (19% needed hearing aids). Behavioural conditions requiring additional support in school were registered in 10 children.
CONCLUSIONS: In Denmark, incidences of malignant liver tumours during the last four decades have been increasing, as reported in the literature. HB survival has improved since the year 2000 and is comparable with international results. Reduced hearing is the major treatment-related side effect and affects approximately 60% of patients.
