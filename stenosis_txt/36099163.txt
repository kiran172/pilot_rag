Title: Incidence, causes, correlates, and outcome of bioprosthetic valve dysfunction and failure following transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: Bioprosthetic valve dysfunction (BVD) is a major concern regarding transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) durability. We aimed to assess incidence, correlates, causes, and outcome of early to mid-term BVD after TAVI in relation to patient's life expectancy.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive TAVI recipients (2007-20) with a follow-up ≥1 year were prospectively included. BVD and bioprosthetic valve failure (BVF) were assessed according to Valve-Academic-Research-Consortium-3. BVD/BVF and all-cause death served as endpoints. Average life expectancy was calculated from National Open Health Data and patients were stratified according to tertiles (1st: <6.85 years, 2nd: 6.85-9.7 years, 3rd: >9.7 years). Of 1047 patients (81.6 ± 6.8 years old, EuroSCORE II 4.5 ± 2.5), ≥2 follow ups were available from 622 (serial echo cohort). After a median echo follow up of 12.2 months, incidence rates of BVD/BVF were 8.4% (95% confidence interval 6.7-10.3), and 3.5% (2.5-4.9) per valve-year, respectively, without differences between life expectancy tertiles. The incidence of BVD was two-fold higher within the first year of implant (9.9% per valve-year) vs. beyond (4.8% per valve-year). Valve-in-valve procedure and residual stenosis, but not age/life expectancy predisposed for BVD. BVD/BVF were independently associated with outcome for patients in the first [adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) 1.72 (1.06-2.88)/2.97 (1.72-6.22)] and second [AHR 1.96 (1.02-3.73)/2.31 (1.00-5.30)], but not the third tertile of life expectancy (P = n.s.).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large prospective observational cohort, early to mid-term BVD after TAVI occurred at the same rate across the spectrum of life expectancy and was associated with increased mortality in patients with short but not in those with the longest life expectancy.
