Title: Influence of Handgrip Strength and Psoas Muscle Index on Analgesic Efficacy of Epidural Steroid Injection in Patients With Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Handgrip strength (HGS) and psoas muscle index (PMI) are widely used protocols for screening or diagnosing sarcopenia by measuring muscle strength and mass. Epidural steroid injection (ESI) is a common intervention for the treatment of spinal pain; however, the influence of pre-procedural sarcopenic status on therapeutic effects after ESI has not been investigated.
OBJECTIVES: In the present study, whether pre-procedural HGS or PMI predicts analgesic efficacy of ESI in elderly patients with degenerative lumbar spinal disease was investigated.
STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective observational study.
SETTING: The study included patients from the outpatient department for interventional pain management at a university hospital.
METHODS: Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, patients &gt;= 65 years of age who underwent fluoroscopy-guided lumbar ESI from 2016 to 2017 in our clinic were enrolled in the present study. Good analgesia was defined as &gt;= 50% reduction in pain score at 4 weeks after injection. Patient characteristics, pain-related factors, clinical factors, HGS, and PMI measurements were collected and analyzed using multivariate analysis to identify the predictors of good analgesia after lumbar ESI. In addition, a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed, and area under the curve (AUC) values with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for the HGS.
RESULTS: A total of 259 patients satisfied the study protocol requirements. HGS was significantly higher in the good analgesia group (23.12 ± 7.54 vs 16.55 ± 6.66 kg, P &lt; 0.001). However, the PMI did not differ between the 2 groups (5.25 ± 1.55 vs 5.08 ± 1.69 cm2/m2, P = 0.406). Multivariate analysis revealed higher HGS (odds ratio, OR = 1.142, 95% CI = 1.094-1.193, P &lt; 0.001) and low-grade foraminal stenosis (OR = 0.403, 95% CI = 0.199-0.814, P = 0.011) were significantly associated with good analgesia after injection. The AUC values with 95% CI for HGS were 0.819 (0.718-0.920) in men and 0.800 (0.732-0.869) in women. In addition, HGS cutoff values for predicting good analgesic outcomes were 26.5 kg in men and 16.5 kg in women.
LIMITATIONS: This study was conducted in a single center, and sample size was relatively small. The lack of physical performance evaluation did not fully meet the current criteria for sarcopenia. In addition, post-procedural clinical data associated with disability or quality of life could not be collected.
CONCLUSION: In the present study, pre-procedural HGS was an independent predictor of analgesic efficacy after ESI in elderly patients with degenerative lumbar spinal disease. However, the PMI was not associated with pain relief after injection.
