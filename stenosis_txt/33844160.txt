Title: Circulating miR-342-5p serves as a diagnostic biomarker in patients with carotid artery stenosis and predicts the occurrence of the cerebral ischemic event.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid artery stenosis (CAS) is an important risk factor for cerebral ischemia events (CIE). Previous studies have shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the occurrence and development of CAS.
AIMS: The purpose of this study was to reveal the clinical diagnostic value of miR-342-5p for asymptomatic CAS (ACAS) and to evaluate its predictive value for the occurrence of CIE in patients.
METHODS: A total of 92 ACAS patients and 86 healthy controls were enrolled as subjects. The expression level of serum miR-342-5p was detected by qRT-PCR. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to detect the diagnostic value of miR-342-5p in ACAS. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analysis assessed the predictive value of miR-342-5p for the occurrence of CIE in ACAS patients.
RESULTS: The level of serum miR-342-5p in ACAS patients was significantly higher than that in healthy controls (P < 0.05). ROC curve showed the high diagnostic value of serum miR-342-5p, which could distinguish ACAS patients from healthy controls. Multivariate Cox regression analysis confirmed that miR-342-5p was an independent predictor (HR = 5.512, 95%CI = 1.370-22.176, P = 0.016). What is more, Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed that patients with high miR-342-5p expression develop more CIE (log-rank, P = 0.020).
CONCLUSIONS: miR-342-5p was significantly overexpressed in ACAS. And the upregulation of serum miR-342-5p is a valuable diagnostic biomarker and can predict the occurrence of CIE.
