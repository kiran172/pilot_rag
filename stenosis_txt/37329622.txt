Title: A CT-based deep learning system for automatic assessment of aortic root morphology for TAVI planning.

Abstract: Accurate planning of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is important to minimize complications, and it requires anatomic evaluation of the aortic root (AR), commonly performed through 3D computed tomography (CT) image analysis. Currently, there is no standard automated solution for this process. Two convolutional neural networks with 3D U-Net architectures (model 1 and model 2) were trained on 310 CT scans for AR analysis. Model 1 performs AR segmentation and model 2 identifies the aortic annulus and sinotubular junction (STJ) contours. After training, the two models were integrated into a fully automated pipeline for geometric analysis of the AR. Results were validated against manual measurements of 178 TAVI candidates. The trained CNNs segmented the AR, annulus, and STJ effectively, resulting in mean Dice scores of 0.93 for the AR, and mean surface distances of 0.73 mm and 0.99 mm for the annulus and STJ, respectively. Automatic measurements were in good agreement with manual annotations, yielding annulus diameters that differed by 0.52 [-2.96, 4.00] mm (bias and 95% limits of agreement for manual minus algorithm). Evaluating the area-derived diameter, bias, and limits of agreement were 0.07 [-0.25, 0.39] mm. STJ and sinuses diameters computed by the automatic method yielded differences of 0.16 [-2.03, 2.34] and 0.1 [-2.93, 3.13] mm, respectively. The proposed tool is a fully automatic solution to quantify morphological biomarkers for pre-TAVI planning. The method was validated against manual annotation from clinical experts and showed to be quick and effective in assessing AR anatomy, with potential for time and cost savings.
