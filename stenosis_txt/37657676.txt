Title: Ultrasound Examination Without Axial Imaging is Sufficient for Preoperative Planning in Transcarotid Artery Revascularization (TCAR).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Duplex ultrasound is frequently used to determine the degree of carotid stenosis. However, axial imaging is typically obtained for operative planning for transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR). We examined if ultrasound alone is sufficient before TCAR.
METHODS: Data from the Vascular Quality Initiative TCAR Surveillance Project registry between 2016 and 2021 was obtained. Patients were divided into 2 groups-those with preoperative ultrasound-alone (US) and those with additional axial imaging (AX). Perioperative outcomes were compared utilizing univariate Chi-square, independent t-test, multivariate logistic regression, and Kaplan-Meier analysis.
RESULTS: There were 3,418 patients identified: 682 in the US group and 2,736 in the AX group. More preoperative hypertension was reported in US (16.1% vs. 10.2%, P < 0.001) while cardiovascular disease (23% vs. 28.9%, P = 0.006) and prior ipsilateral stroke (22% vs. 32.7%, P = 0.002) were more prevalent in AX. More patients had history of contralateral carotid endarterectomy (13.6% vs. 16.7%, P = 0.035) or either ipsilateral (2.6% vs. 1.2%, P = 0.002) or contralateral (7.9% vs. 4.9%, P = 0.008) carotid artery stenting in the US group. Lower preoperative creatinine was reported in the US cohort (1.09 ± 0.01 vs. 1.18 ± 0.02, P < 0.001) while more were symptomatic in AX (28.2% vs. 36.2%, P < 0.001). There were no significant differences between lesion characteristics or operative decision making. A slightly higher total procedure time was seen in AX (73.7 ± 0.6 vs. 68.6 ± 1.3 min, P = 0.017). No differences were seen in perioperative transient ischemic attack/stroke or other immediate complications. At 2-year follow-up, both groups reported no significant differences in stroke-free survival (P = 0.750) and independent functional status remained near-identical (97.3% vs. 97.4%, P = 0.921). Kaplan-Meier analysis yielded no significant difference between mortality at 2 years (P = 0.563). Bivariate logistic regression modeling did reveal a statistically significant increase in likelihood of long-term ipsilateral stroke (odds ratio 1.77, P = 0.015) and non stroke-related complication in the postoperative period (odds ratio 4.81, P = 0.005). However, only a statistically significant relationship persisted in non-stroke complication when the model was controlled for between-group differences.
CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences in postoperative or long-term complications were noted with additional AX in preoperative TCAR planning. Thus, duplex ultrasound offers a safe and effective alternative for those with contraindication or axial imaging.
