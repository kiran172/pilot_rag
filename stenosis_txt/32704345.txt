Title: Gastric outlet obstruction secondary to peptic ulcer disease, previously misdiagnosed as idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in a 16-year-old girl: a case report.

Abstract: Gastric outlet obstruction encompasses a broad spectrum of conditions characterized by complete or incomplete obstruction of the distal stomach, which interrupts gastric emptying and prevents the passage of gastric contents beyond the proximal duodenum. Idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most common cause with an incidence of 1.5-3 per 1000 live births. However, it is excluded; other causes in children such as peptic ulcer disease are relatively rare. We report a case of an acquired gastric outlet obstruction due to peptic ulcer disease, previously misdiagnosed as idiopathic hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in a 16-year-old girl. Beyond the rarity of this clinical event, this case highlights the challenges of the aetiological diagnosis of gastric outlet obstruction with subsequent therapeutic issues, and is the first documented case in Cameroon.
