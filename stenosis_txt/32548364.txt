Title: Innominate vein stenosis causing raised intracranial pressure and blindness.

Abstract: Central venous stenosis causing elevated intracranial pressure is a rare and potentially reversible cause of blindness in patients undergoing hemodialysis. We present the case of a 69-year-old man with progressive vision loss and raised intracranial pressure that was successfully treated with an innominate vein stent.
