Title: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic value of computed tomography angiography for severe internal carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Due to the increasing incidence of ischaemic cerebrovascular diseases, the accurate assessment of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis is crucial for the development of treatment plans. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value of computed tomography angiography (CTA) for severe ICAstenosis, thereby providing support for clinical decision-making and promoting diagnostic updates.
METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals (VIP), and Chinese Biomedical Literature (CBM) electronic databases were searched from inception to March 21, 2024, to identify publicly available research literature on the use of CTA to diagnose severe ICA stenosis. Literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were conducted based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) standards. Data analysis was performed using Stata 17.0 and Meta-Disc 1.4 software. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio of the included studies were calculated using Stata 17.0 software, and forest plots and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were generated. The area under the curve (AUC) was calculated, and funnel plots were constructed to assess publication bias.
RESULTS: A total of 16 studies with 2368 vascular segments were included. The meta-analysis revealed that the combined sensitivity and specificity of CTA for severe ICA stenosis were 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88 ~ 0.96) and 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96 ~ 1.00), respectively. The combined positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 92.0 (95% CI: 24.2 ~ 349.6) and 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04 ~ 0.13), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio was 1302 (95% CI: 257 ~ 6606), and the AUC of the SROC curve was 0.98. The Deeks funnel plot suggested no publication bias among the included studies.
CONCLUSION: CTA demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing severe ICA stenosis. Therefore, this study provided important evidence for the accurate diagnosis and treatment of severe ICA stenosis. However, there was considerable heterogeneity among the included studies, thus indicating the need for additional high-quality prospective studies to confirm the clinical applicability of CTA.
