Title: Early Outcomes for Surgical Minimally Invasive SAPIEN 3 Transcatheter Mitral Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Limited surgical options are available for patients with extensive mitral annular calcification. Several reports have shown the feasibility of surgical mitral valve replacement (MVR) using a transcatheter aortic valve in the mitral position (MVR-TAVR). This study reviewed 30-day and 1-year outcomes of a minimally invasive approach for MVR-TAVR.
METHODS: Between 2017 and 2019, 16 patients underwent MVR-TAVR under direct vision. Primary end points included overall survival, technical success, and effectiveness. Secondary end points included valve and cardiac hemodynamics postoperatively and during follow up.
RESULTS: The 16 patients (69% female) were 53 to 88 years of age (average, 77 Â± 9 years). Comorbidities on presentation were as follows: 31% (5 of 16) were reoperative procedures; 13% (3 of 16) of patients had right ventricular dysfunction, 31% (5 of 16) had severe pulmonary hypertension, and 20% (3 of 16) had chronic kidney disease. Isolated MVR-TAVR was performed on 69% (11 of 16) of patients, with a cross-clamp (58%; 7 of 12) or on a fibrillating heart (42%; 5 of 12), whereas concomitant MVR-TAVR was performed in 31% (5 of 16) of patients with a cross-clamp. At follow-up, the estimated 30-day mortality rate was 12.5%, and the 1-year mortality rate was 36.2%. A moderate postoperative paravalvular leak (PVL) was evident immediately in 1 patient, and a severe PVL was noted after 30-day follow-up in another. In addition, 1 patient had mild left ventricular outflow tract obstruction, and another had moderate mitral valve stenosis. At 1-year follow-up, there were no changes in the mild PVL and moderate stenosis identified postoperatively.
CONCLUSIONS: Minithoracotomy MVR-TAVR is an acceptable alternative to conventional and transcatheter MVR in patients with mitral valve disease and extensive mitral annular calcification.
