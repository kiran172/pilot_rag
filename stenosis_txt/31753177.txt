Title: Aortic Stenosis: Guidelines and Evidence Gaps.

Abstract: Current guidelines for management of adults with aortic stenosis recommend aortic valve replacement for patients with clinical consequences due to hemodynamically severe valve obstruction. However, advances in surgical and transcatheter techniques, and improved valve design have led to decreased procedural risk and improved long-term outcomes. Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is recommended for patients with prohibitive surgical risk and is reasonable in intermediate and high-risk patients. Recent trials demonstrated favorable short-term outcomes in patients with low surgical risk undergoing TAVR compared with surgical AVR. We review the current Guidelines recommendations and highlight key controversies in management due to evidence gaps.
