Title: [Indications and complications prevention and management of phaseⅡ implantation of Provox Vega voice prosthesis after total laryngectomy].

Abstract: Objective: To explore the indications and management of common postoperative complications of phase II tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) for Provox Vega voice prosthesis after total laryngectomy. Methods: The clinical data of 20 patients undergoing phase II TEP for Provox Vega voice prosthesis in our hospital between May 2021 and January 2022 were analyzed. Among them, there were 19 males and 1 female, aged from 37 to 76 years, with an average age of (60.0±8.4)years. The surgical indications and the prevention and treatment of common postoperative complications were summarized. Descriptive analysis was used in this research. Results: The basic surgical indications were as following: after total laryngectomy, there was no stenosis of the stoma and esophagus entrance, no scar constitution, no mouth opening restriction, no stiffness and backward restraint of the neck after radiotherapy, and more than half a year apart surgery or radiotherapy. Among the 20 patients, 18 underwent implantation successfuly, 1 failed in the operation, and for 1 patient, the prosthesis was removed due to bleeding 1 week after implantation. The common postoperative complications included TEP fistula infection (2 cases), the TEP fistula bleeding(1 case), deep neck (prevertebral) abscess (1 case), granulation at the inner side of the TEP fistula (1 case), invagination of the prosthesis (2 cases) and leakage around the prosthesis (2 cases). All patients were cured with different interventions. Conclusions: The Provox Vega voice prosthesis is generally safe for phase Ⅱ implantatione, but implantation indications need to be established. Common postoperative complications can be solved through preventive and remedial interventions.
