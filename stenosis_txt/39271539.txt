Title: A breakthrough in lumbar surgery: ipsilateral interlaminar endoscopy and its impact on spinal stability and patient outcomes.

Abstract: Lumbar stenosis (LS) often leads to debilitating symptoms due to nerve compression in the spinal canal. As this condition becomes increasingly prevalent among the elderly, innovative surgical techniques are crucial. This letter examines a recent advancement introduced by Marco Aur√©lio Moscatelli et al., who have developed an ipsilateral interlaminar endoscopic approach for decompression at the L5-S1 level. Their study, involving 30 patients with degenerative stenosis, reports significant improvements in quality-of-life metrics, including the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and visual analog scales (VAS) for pain. The new approach not only overcomes anatomical challenges specific to the L5-S1 region but also offers enhanced visualization and extensive decompression without destabilizing the spine. This letter highlights the promising results of this technique, the utility of the FAPDIS algorithm in guiding surgical choices, and the broader implications for minimally invasive lumbar surgery. The findings underscore a potential shift towards more effective and safer interventions for lumbar stenosis, paving the way for better patient outcomes in spinal decompression.
