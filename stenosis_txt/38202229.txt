Title: Short-Term Changes in Arterial Stiffness Measured by 2D Speckle Tracking in Patients Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Arterial stiffness has received increasing interest as a cardiovascular marker in patients with aortic valve stenosis (AS). So far, studies on the impact of aortic valve replacement (AVR) on arterial stiffness have been equivocal. Two-dimensional speckle tracking (2DST) is a novel, non-invasive method to measure the motion of the vessel wall. In this prospective observational study, we aimed to assess the change in arterial stiffness of the common carotid artery (CCA) measured by 2DST in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). A total of 47 patients were included in the study (age 80.04 ± 6.065 years). Peak circumferential strain (CS) was significantly improved after TAVI (4.50 ± 2.292 vs. 5.12 ± 2.958, p = 0.012), as was the peak strain rate (CSR) (0.85 ± 0.567 vs. 1.35 ± 0.710, p = 0.002). Body mass index (BMI), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and hemodynamic parameters were associated with this change. 2DST results did not correlate with aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV) or augmentation index normalized to heart rate (AIx@75), suggesting a distinct difference between arterial stiffness of the CCA and other stiffness parameters. 2DST seems to be a promising new tool to assess arterial stiffness in TAVI patients.
