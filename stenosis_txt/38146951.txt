Title: Validation of the Back-table Graft Arterial Anastomosis between the Splenic Artery and Superior Mesenteric Artery: Arterial Complications after a 21-year Single-center Experience of Pancreas Transplantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine the role of the arterial splenomesenteric anastomosis (ASMA) vascular reconstruction technique in terms of arterial vascular complications in pancreas transplant (PT) recipients.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: The ASMA technique was first described in 1992 by Hospital Clínic Barcelona group. Regardless that the iliac Y-graft technique is the most frequently used worldwide, evidence of arterial complications and implications of using a different back-table reconstruction is conspicuously absent in the literature.
METHODS: Descriptive review of 407 PTs performed at a single center (1999-2019) by analyzing the type of arterial reconstruction technique, focusing on ASMA. The endpoints were the management of arterial complications and long-term patient and graft survival.
RESULTS: ASMA was performed in 376 cases (92.4%) and a Y-graft in 31 cases (7.6%). A total of 34 arterial complications (8.3%) were diagnosed. In the ASMA group (n=30, 7.9%) they comprised: 15 acute thrombosis; 4 stenosis; 1 pseudoaneurysm and 10 diverse chronic arterial complications while in the Y-graft group (n=4, 12.9%) 3 acute thrombosis and 1 chronic artery-duodenal fistula occurred. Graft salvage was achieved in 16 patients (53.3%) from the ASMA group and in 2 (50%) from the Y-graft. After a median follow-up of 129.2 (IQR 25-75%, 77.2 -182) months the overall graft and patient survival for the whole cohort at 1, 5, and 10 years was 86.7%, 79.5%, 70.5%, and 98.5%, 95.3%, 92.5%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ASMA proves to be a safe and more easily reproducible technique and should therefore be considered for first-line back-table reconstruction in the PT population.
