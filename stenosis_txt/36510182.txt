Title: Long-term outcome and factors associated with restenosis after combination therapy of balloon angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic intracranial stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for intracranial artery stenosis (ICAS) has not been established. We retrospectively examined the initial and long-term outcomes associated with restenosis of a combination therapy of balloon angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic atherosclerotic ICAS.
METHODS: Consecutive patients who underwent balloon angioplasty and/or stenting for ≥ 70% ICAS between 2006 and 2020 were analyzed. Patients within 48 h of stroke onset were excluded. The following procedures were established as standards at our institution: (1) primary balloon angioplasty alone was initially performed; (2) stenting for insufficient dilatation, recoiling, or dissection was conducted; and (3) stenting was considered for restenosis. Intracranial ischemic and hemorrhagic complications within 30 days after treatment were used to evaluate periprocedural safety. Recurrent ischemic events, restenosis and restenosis related factors were used to be evaluate the long-term outcome.
RESULTS: A total of 160 patients were recruited. Initial treatment consisted of balloon angioplasty (n = 101) and stenting (n = 59). Intracranial complications within 30 days after treatment were ischemic in five (3.1%) and hemorrhagic in four patients (2.5%). The incidence of these complication was 3.1% in the stenting group and 2.5% in the balloon angioplasty group. The mean follow-up period was 53.9 months. Restenosis was found in 42 patients (26%). Recurrent ischemic events during follow-up were noted in 14 patients (8.8%), of which six patients had TIA and eight patients had ischemic stroke. Restenosis-associated factors included diabetes, coronary artery disease, percent stenosis after treatment, and balloon angioplasty in logistic univariate analysis. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that diabetes (HR: 2.084, CI: 1.039-4.180, p = 0.0386), length of lesion (HR; 1.358, CI: 1.174-1.571, p < 0.0001), and balloon angioplasty (HR: 4.194, CI: 1.083-16.239, p = 0.0379) were independent predictors for restenosis.
CONCLUSION: Combination therapy of balloon angioplasty and stenting for symptomatic ICAS had a low perioperative stroke rate and may improve long-term outcome. Balloon angioplasty, diabetes, and length of lesion were significantly associated with restenosis.
