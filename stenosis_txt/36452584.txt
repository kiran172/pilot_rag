Title: Cricoid Cartilage Hypertrophy as the Cause of Larynx Stenoses: Case Report and Updated Literature Review.

Abstract: Aerodigestive obstruction due to cricoid hypertrophy is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. We present a two-year-old female patient who displayed repetitive respiratory infections, swallowing disorder, and malnutrition without any eye signs or symptoms of airway alterations. We described a patient with aerodigestive obstruction generating a marked narrowing of the trachea immediately below the larynx due to severe thickening of the cricoid cartilage. She was successfully treated with surgery, and the clinical and radiological features of this condition are presented here with a review of the literature.
