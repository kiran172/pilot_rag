Title: MRI findings differentiating tonsillar herniation caused by idiopathic intracranial hypertension from Chiari I malformation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Some patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) have cerebellar tonsillar herniation ≥ 5 mm mimicking Chiari malformation I (CMI), which can result in misdiagnosis and unjustified treatment. Our purpose was to identify IIH patients with tonsillar herniation ≥ 5 mm (IIH<sub>TH</sub>) and compare with CMI patients to assess imaging findings that could distinguish the two conditions.
METHODS: Ninety-eight patients with IIH, 81 patients with CMI, and 99 controls were retrospectively assessed. Two neuroradiologists blindly reviewed MR images. IIH<sub>TH</sub> patients were compared with CMI patients and controls regarding the extent of tonsillar herniation (ETH), bilateral transverse sinus stenosis (BTSS), hypophysis-sella ratio (HSR), and bilateral tortuosity of optic nerve (BTON).
RESULTS: 13/98 (13.2%) IIH patients had tonsillar herniation ≥ 5 mm (IIH<sub>TH</sub>) and were significantly younger and had higher BMI compared with CMI patients and controls. ETH was significantly less in the IIH<sub>TH</sub> than CMI (6.5 ± 2.4 mm vs. 10.9 ± 4.4 mm; p &lt; 0.001). BTSS and HSR &lt; 0.5 were more common in IIH<sub>TH</sub> than CMI (p &lt; 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively). No differences were seen between CMI and controls. BTON was significantly more common in IIH<sub>TH</sub> compared to control (p = 0.01) but not to the CMI (p = 0.36). Sensitivity and specificity to differentiate IIH<sub>TH</sub> from CMI were 69.2% and 96.1% for BTSS and 69.2% and 75.3% for HSR &lt; 0.5.
CONCLUSION: The presence of BTSS and/or HSR < 0.5 in patients with ETH ≥ 5 mm should suggest further evaluation to exclude IIH before considering CMI surgery.
