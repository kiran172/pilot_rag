Title: TAVI-CT score to evaluate the anatomic risk in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) requires thorough preprocedural planning with non-invasive imaging, including computed tomography (CT). The plethora of details obtained with thoraco-abdominal CT represents a challenge for accurate and synthetic decision-making. We devised and tested a comprehensive score suitable to summarize CT exams when planning TAVI. An original comprehensive scoring system (TAVI-CT score) was devised, including details on cardiac, aortic, iliac and femoral artery features. The score was applied to a prospectively collected series of patients undergoing TAVI at our institution, driving decision making on access and prosthesis choice. Different TAVI-CT score groups were compared in terms of procedural success, acute complications, and early clinical outcomes. We included a total of 200 undergoing TAVI between February 2020 and May 2021, with 74 (37.0%) having a low (0-2) TAVI-CT score, 50 (25.0%) having a moderate (3) TAVI-CT score, and 76 (38.0%) having a high (≥ 4) TAVI-CT score. Male gender was the only non-CT variable significantly associated with the TAVI-CT score (p = 0.001). As expected, access choice differed significantly across TAVI-CT scores (p = 0.009), as was device choice, with Portico more favored and Allegra less favored in the highest TAVI-CT score group (p = 0.036). Acute outcomes were similar in the 3 groups, including device and procedural success rates (respectively p = 0.717 and p = 1). One-month follow-up showed similar rates of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and bleeding, as well as of a composite safety endpoint (all p > 0.05). However, vascular complications were significantly more common in the highest TAVI-CT score group (p = 0.041). The TAVI-CT score is a simple scoring system that could be routinely applied to CT imaging for TAVI planning, if the present hypothesis-generating findings are confirmed in larger prospective studies.
