Title: Partial Ross procedure for aortic valve repair in children with bicuspid aortic valve: An original surgical technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: There is still no optimal strategy for aortic valve repair in children. To assess the safety and efficacy of an original surgical technique: Partial-Ross procedure.
METHODS: Eight pediatric patients with bicuspid aortic valve underwent the Partial-Ross procedure.
RESULTS: The patients were doing well at a longest duration of 58-month follow-up visit. There was no case with aortic stenosis and three cases with mild to moderate aortic regurgitation, which had no significant clinical impact.
CONCLUSION: Partial-Ross procedure could be used as an alternative for aortic valve repair in children.
