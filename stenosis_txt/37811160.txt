Title: Do Not Forget the Oncovascular: Acute Limb Ischaemia Due to Aortic Epithelioid Angiosarcoma.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Aortic epithelioid angiosarcoma (AEA) is a rare malignant tumour and can cause acute limb ischaemia.
REPORT: A 66 year old man was admitted with acute pulmonary oedema due to bilateral renal artery stenosis. An incidental osteolytic left sacral lesion was found on computed tomography angiography, and extensive work up revealed an AEA. Follow up was marked by acute left lower limb ischaemia 13 months later and right chronic limb threatening ischaemia 15 months later.
DISCUSSION: Physicians need to consider AEA as an aetiology for acute or chronic limb ischaemia in patients with altered general status but mostly with intra-aortic irregular vegetations without any calcification and parietal involvement on computed tomography angiography.
