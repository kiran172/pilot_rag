Title: Novel Clinical Therapies and Technologies in Dialysis Vascular Access.

Abstract: The hemodialysis population continues to grow. Although procedures for dialysis have existed for >60 years, significant challenges with vascular access to support hemodialysis persist. Failure of arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) to mature, loss of AVF and graft patency, thrombosis, and infection hinder long-term access, and add extra health care costs and patient morbidity. There have been numerous innovations over the last decade aimed at addressing the issues. In this study, we review the literature and summarize the recent evolution of drug delivery, graft development, minimally invasive AVF creation, and stem-cell therapy for hemodialysis access.
