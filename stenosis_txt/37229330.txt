Title: Outcomes and Hemodynamic Performances of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement with Two Generations of Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The superiority of the new-generation self-expanding Evolut R compared with the first-generation CoreValve with regards to outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the hemodynamic and clinical performance of Evolut R compared with its direct predecessor, CoreValve, in a Taiwanese population.
METHODS: This study included all consecutive patients who underwent TAVR with either CoreValve or Evolut R between March 2013 and December 2020. Thirty-day Valve Academic Research Consortium-2 (VARC-2)-defined outcomes and hemodynamic performances were investigated.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in baseline demographic characteristics between the patients receiving CoreValve (n = 117) or Evolut R (n = 117). Aortic valve-in-valve procedures for failed surgical bioprosthesis and procedures under conscious sedation were performed significantly more often with Evolut R. Pre-dilatation was performed significantly more often and contrast media volume was significantly higher with CoreValve. Stroke (0% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.024) and the need for emergent conversion to open surgery (0% vs. 5.1%, p = 0.012) were significantly lower in Evolut R than in CoreValve recipients. Evolut R significantly reduced 30-day composite safety endpoint (4.3% vs. 15.4%, p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: Advancements in transcatheter valve technologies have resulted in improved outcomes for patients undergoing TAVR with self-expanding valves. With the new-generation Evolut R, device success was high and the 30-day composite safety endpoint was significantly reduced after TAVR compared with CoreValve.
