Title: One-year safety and efficacy profile of transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation with the portico system.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study sought to investigate the procedural and mid-term outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve implantation for failed surgical bioprostheses (TAVI-ViV) with Portico device.
BACKGROUND: Limited evidence coming from early experience on Portico system does not allow to fully assess safety and efficacy of this device in this ViV patients.
METHODS: From January 2016 up to June 2019, 56 consecutive patients undergoing TAVI-ViV with Portico were prospectively included in our institutional TAVI database.
RESULTS: The prevalent mechanism of failure was stenosis (58.9%); true internal diameter (ID) was <21 mm in 71.4% of cases. Device success rate were 69.6% with 14 (25%) patients showing a residual gradient ≥20 mmHg, 2 (3.6%) a PVL ≥ moderate and 1 (1.8%) required a second THV implantation due to device embolization. At 1-year follow-up 5 patients (8.9%) died whereas moderate SVD was reported in 2 (3.6%). Patients with a post-procedural mean gradient ≥20 mmHg showed a significantly higher rate of CV hospitalization (21.4% vs. 2.4%, p = .02) whereas no differences in procedural and 1-year outcomes were noticed according to true ID diameter or degeneration mode. Chimney stenting (ChT) was performed in 23 (41%) patients without significant differences in procedural and 1-year outcomes compared to non-ChT group.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI-ViV with Portico valve was associated with good procedural and 1-year outcomes, even in patients with features of high procedural and anatomical complexity.
