Title: [A case of R0 resection in conversion surgery after duodenal stent placement for locally advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer with duodenal stenosis].

Abstract: A 67-year-old man presented to our hospital with vomiting. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed duodenal stenosis and atypical epithelium. A tumor in the pancreatic head, about 30mm in size, involving the superior mesenteric artery and a superior mesenteric vein was identified using abdominal contrast computed tomography (CT). Locally advanced pancreatic cancer was diagnosed in the patient through an endoscopic biopsy. Due to the duodenal stenosis complication, duodenal stent placement was conducted. After stent placement, oral intake was resumed, and improvement of the systemic condition led to chemotherapy (modified FOLFIRINOX). After chemotherapy, CT revealed decreased carcinoma progression and vascular invasion. Conversion surgery was improved, and R0 resection was achieved. Our study showed that duodenal stent placement could enhance prognosis;as a result, it was regarded as a good choice for multidisciplinary therapy.
