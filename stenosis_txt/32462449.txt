Title: Chronic stent recoil in severely calcified coronary artery lesions. A serial optical coherence tomography study.

Abstract: Chronic second-generation drug-eluting stent recoil in severely calcified coronary lesions has not been studied. We aimed to evaluate chronic stent recoil by optical coherence tomography (OCT) in severely calcified lesions treated with thin strut stents after rotational atherectomy. In 28 lesions (26 patients with 23% on hemodialysis) treated with everolimus-eluting stents after rotational atherectomy, baseline and 8-month follow-up OCT were compared. Stent recoil was defined as &gt;10% decrease in stent area from baseline to follow-up. Overall, there was no change in minimal stent area (6.0 mm2 [5.0, 8.1] to 6.0 mm2 [4.8, 8.6], p = 0.51) from baseline to follow-up, although neointimal hyperplasia measured 16.3 ± 15.8%. Thirty-six percent of lesions showed stent recoil associated with 6 non-nodular calcifications, 1 calcified nodule, and 3 stent deformations. The overall mean calcium angle with attenuation decreased (54° [29-76] to 31° [19-48], p &lt; 0.0001), and calcium without attenuation increased (28° [21-67] to 64° [34-93], p &lt; 0.0001), but primarily at the location of stent recoil. Furthermore, in the stent recoil segments in 10 recoil lesions, the stent circumference decreased primarily at non-calcium segments rather than at calcium with or without attenuation. One lesion with stent recoil and 2 lesions without stent recoil required repeat revascularization. Thin strut stents can chronically recoil in severely calcified lesions, but this rarely causes restenosis.
