Title: Endoscopic treatment of postoperative intestinal stenosis combined with bilioenteric anastomotic stenosis.

Abstract: Postoperative anastomotic stenosis is a common complication after biliary, pancreatic and gastrointestinal surgery, which may be caused by multiple factors such as tissue proliferation and cancer recurrence. Endoscopic therapy is often hampered when the lens is difficult to pass through. A patient with intestinal stricture complicated by bilioenterostomy stenosis was treated by superselection of guide wire and stent.
