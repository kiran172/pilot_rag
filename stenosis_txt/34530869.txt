Title: Balloon dilation and rapid maxillary expansion: a novel combination treatment for congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis in an infant.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Congenital nasal pyriform aperture stenosis (CNPAS) is a rare condition that may occur alone or as part of a multi-formative syndrome. Management remains difficult. There is no specific treatment protocol. Traditional surgery would be anachronistic; a non-invasive or minimally invasive therapeutic option is required. However, the rarity of the disease and the infantile context render randomised clinical trials difficult.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of a one-month-old Caucasian boy with CNPAS. He presented to the Emergency Department of the Bambino Ges√π Pediatric Hospital with nasal obstruction, noisy breathing, feeding difficulties, and suspected sleep apnoea. During hospitalisation, he underwent overnight pulse oximetry, airway endoscopy, and maxillofacial computed tomography (CT); the final diagnosis was CNPAS with moderate obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome. We successfully treated the patient using an innovative strategy that involved collaboration between ear-nose-and-throat surgeons and orthodontists.
CONCLUSIONS: A combination of minimally invasive balloon surgery and placement of a palatal device may successfully treat CNPAS; it may also treat other types of nasal bone stenosis. Future studies may allow the development of practice consensus treatment strategies.
