Title: THE DIETARY HABITS AND NUTRITION BELIEFS OF PATIENTS WITH AORTIC STENOSIS.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aim: The analysis of dietary knowledge and habits of patients with aortic stenosis, both prior to and post valve implantation.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and methods: Patient with diagnosed moderate or severe aortic stenosis were included into the study. Telephonic dietary interview was performed. It was based on the standard KomPAN questionnaire developed and validated by the Behavioural Nutrition Team, Committee of Human Nutrition of Polish Academy of Sciences.
RESULTS: Results: The analysis was conducted in 94 consecutive patients. The pro-health diet index was 4.87 points (3.7; 5.96), while the optimal level was defined as 20 points. The 12.8% of the respondents had low knowledge about nutrition, 79.8% - moderate and 7.4% - good. From 94 patients, 37 had the patientprosthesis mismatch and overweight. The 35.1% of patients with the patient-prosthesis mismatch and overweight considered their nutritional habits as bad, 62.2% as moderate and 2.7% as good. In a group of patients without the patient-prosthesis mismatch the self-opinion about diet was bad in 20.8%, moderate in 72.9% and good in 6.3%.
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: Dietary habits and nutritional knowledge in patients with aortic stenosis are inadequate. However, awareness of bad dietary habits in patients who are overweight and have patient-prosthesis mismatch is better compared to the remaining group of patients. The proper dietary education is needed in all patients with aortic stenosis.
