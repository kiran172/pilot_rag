Title: Successful Transfemoral Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in a Patient with Double Aortic Arch: An Interesting Imaging Case.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become a mainstay of treatment in the management of severe aortic stenosis. It is a challenging procedure that requires expertise in obtaining proper access, delivery of catheters to and beyond the aortic valve, and finally accurate deployment of the aortic bioprosthesis. Patients with aortic anomalies portend an added challenge in performing TAVR procedures. We present the case of a patient incidentally found to have a right dominant double aortic arch who underwent successful TAVR for severe aortic stenosis.
