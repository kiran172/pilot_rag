Title: Large Right Atrial Thrombus Alongside Left Atrial Thrombus in a Rheumatic Severe Mitral Stenosis Patient.

Abstract: We present finding of right atrial thrombus concomitant with recurrent left atrial thrombus in a patient diagnosed with rheumatic severe mitral stenosis. Its significance lies in the potential complications associated with right atrial thrombus, including spontaneous or iatrogenic pulmonary embolism or paradoxical systemic embolization, underscoring the importance of thorough imaging.
