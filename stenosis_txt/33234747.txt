Title: Portal vein reconstruction using side-to-side unification technique for infant-to-infant deceased donor whole liver transplantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUNDS/AIMS: Infant-to-infant whole liver transplantation (I2I-WLT) has been rarely performed in Korea. We analyze clinical sequences of our 7 cases of I2I-WLT and present evolution of surgical techniques to prevent PV stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 7 cases of I2I-WLT were performed at our institution during last 13 years, which represented 0.1% of our LT volume. Patient perioperative profiles and clinical sequences were analyzed with focusing on portal vein (PV) complications.
RESULTS: Donor ages were 6-17 months and graft weights were 140-525 g. Recipient ages were 7-16 months and body weights were 6-10.1 kg and Primary diagnoses were biliary atresia in 6 and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis in 1. The first case underwent PV stenting 2 months after I2I-WLT, and underwent retransplantation 6 years later. The second case underwent intraoperative PV stenting, but died 32 days later. The third case underwent repeated PV dilatation. The fourth, fifth and seventh cases experienced no surgical complications, and PV reconstruction was performed using a side-to-side unification venoplasty technique. The sixth case had poor development of the PV system, so customized PV venoplasty was performed, but PV occlusion requiring PV stenting occurred. Early retransplantation was performed, but scanty PV flow was detected despite no obvious PV stenosis, resulting in graft failure. Serious PV complications developed in 4, but none experienced after adoption of side-to-side unification venoplasty.
CONCLUSIONS: As PV size in infant donors and recipients is very small, PV reconstruction in I2I-WLT requires specialized surgical techniques of side-to-side unification venoplasty.
