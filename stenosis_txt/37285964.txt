Title: Results of a Flexible Patient-Centered Approach to the Timing of Thoracic Outlet Decompression in Paget Schroetter Syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Treatment algorithms for subclavian vein (SCV) effort thrombosis (Paget-Schroetter syndrome- PSS) are multiple, ranging from thrombolysis (TL) with immediate or delayed thoracic outlet decompression (TOD) to conservative treatment with anticoagulation alone. We follow a regimen of TL/pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) followed by TOD with first rib resection, scalenectomy, venolysis, and selective venoplasty (open or endovascular) performed electively at a time convenient for the patient. Oral anticoagulants are prescribed for 3 months or longer based upon response. The aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes of this flexible protocol.
METHODS: Clinical and procedural details of consecutive patients treated for PSS from January 2001 to August 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. Endpoints included success of TL and eventual clinical outcome. Patients were divided into 2 groups-Group I: TL/PMT + TOD; Group II: medical management/anticoagulation + TOD.
RESULTS: PSS was diagnosed in 114 patients; 104 (62 female, mean age 31 years) who underwent TOD were included in the study. Group I: 53 patients underwent TOD after initial TL/PMT (23 at our institution and 30 elsewhere) with success (acute thrombus resolution) in 80% (n = 20) and 72% (n = 24) respectively. Adjunctive balloon-catheter venoplasty was performed in 67%. TL failed to recanalize the occluded SCV in 11% (n = 6). Complete thrombus resolution was seen in 9% (n = 5). Residual chronic thrombus in 79% (n = 42) resulted in median SCV stenosis of 50% (range 10% to 80%). With continued anticoagulation, further thrombus retraction was noted with median 40% improvement in stenosis including in veins with unsuccessful TL. TOD was performed at a median of 1.5 months (range 2-8 months). Rethrombosis of the SCV occurred in 3 patients 1-3 days postoperatively and was managed with MT/SCV stenting/balloon angioplasty and anticoagulation. Symptomatic relief was achieved in 49/53 (92%) patients at a median follow-up of 14 months. Group II: 51 patients underwent TOD following medical treatment elsewhere with anticoagulation alone for an average 6 months (range 2-18 months) with recurrent SCV thrombosis in 5 (11%). Thirty-nine patients (76%) had persistent symptoms; the remaining had asymptomatic compression of the SCV with maneuvers. SCV occlusion persisted in 4 patients (7%); the indication for TOD being residual symptoms from compression of collateral veins, the median residual stenosis was 70% (range 30-90%). TOD was performed at a median of 6 months after diagnosis of PSS. Open venous reconstruction with endovenectomy and patch was performed in 4 patients and stenting in 2. Symptomatic relief was achieved in 46/51 (90%) at a median follow-up of 24 months.
CONCLUSIONS: For Paget Schroetter syndrome a management protocol encompassing elective thoracic outlet decompression at a convenient time following thrombolysis is safe and effective, with low risk of rethrombosis. Continued anticoagulation in the interim results in further recanalization of the subclavian vein and may reduce the need for open venous reconstruction.
