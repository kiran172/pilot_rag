Title: The combination of preoperative celiac axis stenting and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in an elderly patient with pancreatic cancer: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Celiac axis stenosis (CAS) is frequently observed in patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). This poses challenges because of the potential disruption of the hepatic arterial blood flow.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present the case of an 81-year-old woman diagnosed with pancreatic head cancer and severe CAS caused by calcification. The patient received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and underwent preoperative endovascular stenting of the celiac axis to restore blood flow. After two cycles of NAC, subtotal stomach-preserving PD was performed. An intraoperative assessment of the hepatic arterial blood flow determined that it was well maintained. PD was performed using the standard technique; specialized techniques were not necessary. Importantly, no ischemic complications were encountered.
CONCLUSION: This case report describes the successful combination of preoperative celiac axis stenting, NAC, and surgical intervention for the management of CAS in an elderly patient with pancreatic cancer. This approach offers a potential solution for maintaining the hepatic arterial blood flow in the presence of CAS without vascular reconstruction, particularly in elderly individuals.
