Title: Influence of Hemoglobin Concentration on Stroke Recurrence and Composite Vascular Events.

Abstract: Background and Purpose- We evaluated whether hemoglobin concentration at admission was associated with stroke recurrence and composite vascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death) in acute ischemic stroke. Methods- We collected data from patients with acute ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack from a multicenter stroke registry database in Korea. The association of hemoglobin concentration with 1-year stroke recurrence and composite vascular events was evaluated with respect to age, presence of cerebral artery stenosis, stroke severity, and stroke subtype. Results- Hemoglobin levels were inversely associated with stroke recurrence and composite vascular events. One-year rates of stroke recurrence and composite vascular events were significantly higher in patients with anemia or moderate anemia. In multivariable analyses, moderate anemia remained an independent predictor of stroke recurrence (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.43 [95% CI, 1.16-1.75]) and composite vascular events (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.07-1.48]). Moderate anemia increased the risk of composite vascular events in patients with mild-to-moderate stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score &lt;16, P=0.01 for interaction). Conclusions- Hemoglobin concentration could be an independent predictor of stroke recurrence and composite vascular events.
