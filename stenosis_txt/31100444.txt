Title: Neurocognitive Changes After Carotid Revascularization According to Perfusion Parameters: A Meta-analysis of Current Literature.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although the clinical outcomes continue to be scrutinized, there are a few data summarizing the changes in perfusion parameters in postoperative patients. The objective was to undertake a systematic literature review and perform a meta-analysis to assess the effects of cerebral perfusion changes in cognitive and functional status.
METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in July 2018 identifying articles comparing perfusion parameter changes before and after carotid revascularization in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Combined overall effect sizes were calculated using random-effects models.
RESULTS: The literature search identified 1031 unique articles eligible for analysis. Sixteen studies including 755 patients were identified. The studies were different for many methodological factors, for example, sample size, type of patients, statistical measure, type of test, timing of assessment, and so on. There were no differences in cerebral blood volume (CBV), cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO<sub>2</sub>), and relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) between preintervention and postintervention, but there was a significant increase of cerebral blood flow (CBF) (95% confidence interval [CI] standardized mean difference [Std. MD] : -0.83 [-1.27, -0.40]; P = 0.0002; I2 = 68%) and relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) (95% CI Std. MD: -0.72 [-1.61, -0.27]; P &lt; 0.0001; I2 = 48%) after operation. In addition, the perfusion of mean transit time (MTT) (95% CI Std. MD: 1.26 [0.62, 1.90]; P = 0.0001; I2 = 84%), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) (95% CI Std. MD: 0.78 [0.24, 1.33]; P = 0.005; I2 = 0%), time to peak (TTP) (95% CI Std. MD: 0.46 [0.16, 0.77]; P = 0.003; I2 = 47%), and relative mean transit time (rMTT) (95% CI Std. MD: 0.41 [0.33, 0.50]; P &lt; 0.00001; I2 = 67%) was higher before than after operation.
CONCLUSIONS: The increase in changes in CBF and rCBF and the decrease in MTT, OEF, TTP, and rMTT after operation may indicate the improvement of cognition in the short term. Intraoperative perfusion parameters could be an important adjuvant monitoring method in neurocognitive changes after carotid revascularization.
