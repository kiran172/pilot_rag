Title: A Case of Intraprocedural Plaque Protrusion during Carotid Artery Stenting Using the Stent-in-Stent Technique for Carotid Artery Stenosis with Unstable Plaque.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Carotid artery stenting (CAS) using the stent-in-stent technique was reported to prevent intraprocedural plaque protrusion (PP) in patients with carotid artery stenosis with unstable plaque. We report a case of intraoperative PP after CAS despite the use of stent-in-stent technique.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 63-year-old man presented with rapid progression of right carotid artery stenosis with unstable plaque during follow-up and was admitted to undergo CAS. Under local anesthesia with Mo.Ma Ultra and FilterWire EZ protection, CAS was performed using the stent-in-stent technique. The first 8 mm × 29 mm Carotid Wallstent (CWS) was placed. The second CWS (6 mm × 22 mm) was placed in a stent-in-stent manner to match the stenotic lesion, and conservative postdilation was performed. Then the third CWS (6 mm × 22 mm) was added due to the presence of PP on intravascular ultrasonography (IVUS). No postoperative neurological abnormalities were found, and no new high-signal areas were observed on diffusion-weighted MRI the day after surgery. The patient was discharged without postoperative complications. No stroke and restenosis were observed at 3 months after CAS.
CONCLUSION: PP can occur even with stent-in-stent technique, suggesting the importance of diagnosis by IVUS.
