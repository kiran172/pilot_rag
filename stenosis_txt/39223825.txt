Title: Post-acute sequelae of COVID infection and cerebral venous outflow disorders: Overlapping symptoms and mechanisms?

Abstract: Neurological long Covid (NLC) is a major post-acute sequela of SARS-CoV-2 infection, affecting up to 10% of infected patients. The clinical presentation of patients with NLC is varied, but general NLC symptoms have been noted to closely mimic symptoms of cerebral venous outflow disorders (CVD). Here we review key literature and discuss evidence supporting this comparison. We also aimed to describe the similarity between CVD symptomatology and neuro-NLC symptoms from two perspectives: a Twitter-distributed survey for long covid sufferers to estimate nature and frequency of neurological symptoms, and through a small cohort of patients with long covid who underwent CVD work up per our standard workflow. Over 700 patients responded, and we argue that there is a close symptom overlap with those of CVD. CVD workup in a series of 6 patients with neurological long COVID symptoms showed jugular vein stenosis by CT venography and varying degrees of increased intracranial pressure. Finally, we discuss the potential pathogenic association between vascular inflammation, associated with COVID-19 infection, venous outflow congestion, and its potential involvement in NLC.
