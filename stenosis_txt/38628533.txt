Title: A bibliometric analysis of the 100 most-cited clinical articles in the research of intracranial artery stenosis and intracranial atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial arterial stenosis (ICAS), caused by intracranial atherosclerosis, is one of the major causes of ischemic stroke. This study identified the top 100 most-cited publications on ICAS through a bibliometric analysis.
METHODS: Two independent authors conducted a search in the Web of Science database for clinical articles on ICAS published between 1993 and 2022. The top 100 most-cited articles were then extracted. For each article, the analysis covered the title, author, country of origin/affiliation, journal, total number of citations, number of citations per year, and type of study.
RESULTS: The top 100 most-cited papers in the ICAS were authored by 565 authors from 12 countries and published in 29 journals. In terms of the 5-year trend, the largest number of papers were published between 2003 and 2007 (n = 31). The median number of citations for the 100 papers was 161 (range 109-1,115). The journal with the highest proportion of the 100 most published articles was Stroke, accounting for 41% of articles and 37% of the citations. According to country of origin, the United States of America accounted for the largest number of articles, followed by China, Japan, and South Korea, with these four countries together accounting for 81% of the total number of articles and 88% of the citations. Trends in the past five years included the use of terms such as acute ischemic stroke and mechanical thrombectomy.
CONCLUSION: The findings of this study provide novel insight into this field and will facilitate future research endeavors.
