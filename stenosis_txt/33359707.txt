Title: Disparities Between International Guidelines (AHA/ESC/ESVS/ESVM/SVS) Concerning Lower Extremity Arterial Disease: Consensus of the French Society of Vascular Medicine (SFMV) and the French Society for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (SCVE).

Abstract: Several international guidelines concerning lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) have been published recently, in particular, by the American Heart Association the European Society of Cardiology/European Society for Vascular Surgery, the European Society for Vascular Medicine and the Society for Vascular Surgery. These guidelines differ in some respects and certain issues are not addressed. The objective of this consensus driven by the French Societies of vascular Medicine and surgery was to analyze the disparities between the different guidelines, as well as certain issues not covered, and develop proposals with regard to these points. The following fields of LEAD have been explored: 1) classifications, 2) clinical evaluation, 3) diagnostic criteria, 4) quantification of arterial stenosis using duplex ultrasound, 5) detection of asymptomatic multisite lesions, 6) screening for LEAD in the context of cardiac disease, 7) medical treatment, 8) supervised exercise therapy, 9) revascularization and revascularization of the internal artery stenosis, 10) management of chronic limb ischemia, 11) longitudinal follow-up, and 12) diet.
