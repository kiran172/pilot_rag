Title: Lipoprotein(a) Is Associated with Thrombus Burden in Culprit Arteries of Younger Patients with ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The burden of thrombus in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has implications on treatment and outcomes. However, the association between Lp(a) and atherothrombosis in STEMI remains unclear.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine the association between Lp(a) and culprit artery thrombus burden in younger patients with STEMI.
METHODS: This was a single-center study of 83 patients aged <65 years with STEMI between 2016-2018 who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention and measurement of Lp(a); those receiving thrombolytic therapy were excluded. Thrombus burden in the culprit artery was determined angiographically using the Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction score and classified as absent-to-small, moderate, or large. Elevated Lp(a) was defined as plasma mass concentration >30 mg/dL. Multivariate analysis was performed adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors.
RESULTS: The mean age was 48.0 Â± 8.4 years, and 78.3% were male. Thirteen (16%), 9 (11%), and 61 (73%) patients had small, moderate, or large thrombus burden, respectively, and 34 (41%) had elevated Lp(a). Elevated Lp(a) was associated with greater thrombus burden compared to normal Lp(a) (large burden 85% vs. 65%; p = 0.024). Elevated Lp(a) was associated with moderate or large thrombus in univariate (OR 10.70 [95% CI 1.32-86.82]; p = 0.026) and multivariate analysis (OR 10.33 [95% CI 1.19-89.52]; p = 0.034). Lp(a) was not associated with culprit artery or stenosis location according to culprit artery.
CONCLUSIONS: Elevated Lp(a) is associated with greater thrombus burden in younger patients with STEMI. The finding of this observational study accords with the thrombotic and anti-fibrinolytic properties of Lp(a). A causal relationship requires verification.
