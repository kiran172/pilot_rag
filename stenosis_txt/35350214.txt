Title: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement failure: a case report of the bicuspid aortic valve type 0 with a single coronary artery.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is the treatment of choice for aortic stenosis. However, its safety and efficacy in patients with the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) remain controversial. Especially, whether the BAV phenotype affects outcomes following TAVR remains debated. Despite the higher ellipticity index and more calcifications of the aortic annulus in type 1 BAV, a high residual gradient was observed in type 0 anatomy. Moreover, severe calcification of the cusps rather than aortic annulus in type 0 is predisposed to asymmetrical under-expansion of the prosthesis at the edge of the native aortic cusp. We report the rare case of a patient with BAV stenosis type 0 and single coronary artery receiving TAVR, subsequently requiring surgical aortic valve replacement. The extensive non-coronary cusp calcification caused under-expansion of the prosthesis and was protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract, leading to an obstruction.
