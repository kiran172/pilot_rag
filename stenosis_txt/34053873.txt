Title: Simultaneous Measurement of Left Ventricular and Aortic Pressures Using a Dual-Catheter System With Single Arterial Access.

Abstract: Although echocardiography remains the key tool for evaluation of aortic valve stenosis severity, in a fair minority of patients invasive evaluation is still needed. Dual-lumen catheters allow for simultaneous trans-aortic pressure measurements with single arterial access. We describe a technique where traditional hardware using non-dedicated catheters can be used to obtain simultaneous pressure measurements using a 6 French single arterial access.
