Title: Post-intubation laryngeal injury after COVID-19 treatment causing dyspnea: A report of six cases.

Abstract: Severe cases of COVID-19 often require orotracheal intubation (OTI) and mechanical ventilation, and post-intubation laryngeal injury (PI-LI) is one of the important complications of OTI. Some studies have claimed that the frequency of PI-LI may be higher in COVID-19 patients as compared with that in non-COVID-19 patients, because of the larger size of endotracheal tube used, the longer OTI time, use of prone positioning of the patients, etc. Herein, we describe six cases of PI-LI who presented with dyspnea after recovering from COVID-19. Five of the patients were male and the median OTI period was 9 days. All the patients showed abnormal endoscopic findings, including posterior glottic synechiae/stenosis or subglottic/posterior glottic granulomas. Four patients required surgical intervention, including tracheostomy, laryngomicrosurgery, or laterofixation of the vocal cord. Many post-COVID-19 patients experience persistent symptoms (post-COVID-19 syndrome), including dyspnea. Two of our patients with dyspnea had been treated by internists as cases of post-COVID-19 syndrome. Therefore, we wish to underscore the need for every healthcare professional to be aware of the possibility of PI-LI after OTI, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Otolaryngologists should undertake endoscopic assessment of the larynx in patients presenting with dyspnea after recovering from COVID-19.
