Title: Functional Mitral Stenosis Resulting in Recurrent Flash Pulmonary Edema: A Case Report of an Atypical Complication of Streptococcus viridans Endocarditis.

Abstract: Infective endocarditis (IE) can present with a wide variety of clinical signs and symptoms, making it difficult to diagnose. Recognizing risk factors such as congenital heart disease, intravenous drug use, and prosthetic heart valves can encourage early testing with blood cultures and echocardiography, leading to prompt diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics. Despite early detection and treatment, IE can still result in permanent damage of the affected heart valves, most commonly resulting in valvular regurgitation and signs and symptoms of heart failure. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion as prompt diagnosis and treatment are essential to prevent morbidity and mortality. Valvular stenosis as a result of IE, unlike valvular regurgitation, is extremely rare and has only been described a handful of times in literature. We present a unique case of Streptococcus viridans IE resulting in functional mitral stenosis and recurrent flash pulmonary edema in an elderly female who had recently undergone a dental cleaning procedure.
