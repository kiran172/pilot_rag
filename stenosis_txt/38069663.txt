Title: Femoral vessel complications after transfemoral TAVR-A contemporary sonography-based assessment of 480 patients with third-generation transcatheter valves.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postinterventional sonographic assessment of the femoral artery after transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR) has the potential to identify several pathologies. We investigated the incidence and risk factors of femoral vessel complications in a modern TAVR collective using postinterventional sonography.
METHODS: Between September 2017 and March 2022, 480 patients underwent TF-TAVR with postinterventional femoral sonography at a single center. Clinical outcomes and adverse events were analyzed after the Valve Academic Research Consortium 3 (VARC-3) criteria.
RESULTS: In this cohort (51.2% male; age 80 ± 7.5 years, median EuroSCORE II 3.7) 74.8% (n = 359) were implanted with a self-expandable and 25.2% (n = 121) with a balloon-expandable valve. The main access (valve-delivery) was located right in 91.4% (n = 438), and the primary closure system was Proglide in 95% (n = 456). Vascular complications (VC) were observed in 29.16% (n = 140) of patients; 23.3% (n = 112) presented with minor- and 5.8% (n = 28) with major VC. Postinterventional femoral artery stenosis on the main access was observed in 9.8% (n = 47). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed female sex (p = .03, odds ratio [OR] 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-4.89) and the number of used endovascular closure devices (p = .014, OR 0.11, 95%CI 0.02-0.64) as predictive factors for femoral artery stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of postinterventional femoral artery stenosis following TF-TAVR was higher than expected with a number of used closure devices and female sex being independent risk factors. Considering the continuous advance of TAVR in low-risk patients with preserved physical activity, emphasis should be directed at the correct diagnosis and follow-up of these complications.
