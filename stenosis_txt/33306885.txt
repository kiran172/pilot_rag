Title: Effect of concomitant aortic regurgitation on early hypoattenuated leaflet thickening after transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with symptomatic severe aortic stenosis.

Abstract: Identification of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT) and subacute leaflet thrombosis has become widely recognized. Patients with anatomical changes associated with moderate or greater aortic regurgitation (larger sinus of Valsalva and eccentric left ventricular remodeling) appear to have less HALT early postprocedure compared with those without. Further research on the risk factors including anatomical and hemodynamic variables should further our knowledge of these entities so we can better manage patient both pre and post TAVR.
