Title: Role of Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Morphometric Alterations of Corpus Callosum in Stroke Patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Corpus callosum plays a role in interhemispheric integration, language, intelligence, and creativity of individuals, hence variations in corpus callosum size are seen in various neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and bipolar affective disorder. While the dimensions differ based on gender, age, and ethnicity, pathological variations are seen with some diseases such as vascular dementia, leukoaraiosis, stroke, and carotid artery stenosis. This study was conducted to compare the morphometric alterations of the corpus callosum between normal subjects and stroke patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
METHODS: This was a case-control study conducted on 84 subjects divided into cases and control groups. The widths of the genu, body & splenium, and anterior-posterior (AP) diameter of the corpus callosum were measured and the values were compared among the two groups. Student's t-test and regression analysis were utilized for the analysis of data and p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: Sixteen patients (19.04%) belonged to the age range of 18-40 years, 32 (38.09%) belonged to the age range of 41-60 years and 36 (42.8%) belonged to the age group of >60 years. There was no discrepancy between cases and controls or between the age groups. The mean width of genu, body & splenium, and AP diameter was compared between normal individuals and stroke patients. It was noted to be significantly lesser in cases than in controls. The morphometric indices i.e., width of genu, body & splenium, and AP diameter of the corpus callosum in cases versus controls were noted to be 9.8 ± 1.2 vs. 10.27 ± 0.3 mm, p=0.12; 5.1±0.9 vs. 5.3±0.24 mm, p=0.25; 12.11 ± 9.65 vs. 12.52 ± 13.9 mm, p=0.04 (significant) and 71.22±3.1 vs. 72.32±1.2, p=0.23, respectively.
CONCLUSION: This study showed that patients with stroke have a significant reduction in morphometric indices i.e., width of genu, body & splenium, and the AP diameter of the corpus callosum when compared to normal individuals.
