Title: A Rare Neurological Presentation Post-Cardiac Catheterization.

Abstract: Unilateral Isolated oculomotor nerve palsy is a rare neurological complication after cardiac catheterization. Concomitant thalamus and midbrain infarction secondary to embolic events involving the artery of Percheron after cardiac catheterizationÂ have been reported in the literature. However, isolated midbrain infarction is a rare neurological deficit. Here, we present the case of a patient who presented with mild left-sided ptosis, binocular diplopia, and partially impaired left eye adduction two hours after cardiac catheterization. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed a focal area of restricted diffusion within the midbrain tegmentum, confirming this rare brainstem stroke.
