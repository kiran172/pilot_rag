Title: Pain trajectories over 12 months following conservative care consultation in patients with lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate symptom trajectories in chiropractic patients with lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).
METHODS: Patients diagnosed with LSS were recruited from chiropractic clinics and self-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 1-year follow-up. Patients received weekly text messages about low back pain (LBP) and leg symptoms for 1 year. Group-based trajectory modelling was performed to identify symptom trajectory groups. The groups were compared based on patient characteristics, LBP and leg pain intensity, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Zurich Claudication Questionnaire (ZCQ).
RESULTS: A total of 90 patients were included in the analysis. A three-group trajectory model was chosen: 'improving' (16%), 'fluctuating/improving' (30%), and 'persistent' (54%). The 'persistent' group had a higher proportion of women [71% (95% CI 57-82%)] than the 'improving' group 29% (95% CI 11-56%), and a higher ODI score at both baseline [34.2 (95% CI 29.7-38.8) vs. 22.8 (16.4-29.1)] and 1-year follow-up [28.1 (95% CI 23.2-33.0) vs. 4.8 (0.1-9.4)]. Similar differences were observed for ZCQ symptom and function scores.
CONCLUSIONS: Pain symptoms in people with LSS followed distinctly different trajectories. Half of the sample had a pattern of consistently severe symptoms over a year, while the other half either improved rapidly or experienced fluctuating symptoms with some improvement.
