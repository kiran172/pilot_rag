Title: Coronary Magnetic Resonance Angiography: Technical Innovations Leading Us to the Promised Land?

Abstract: Coronary artery disease remains the leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Invasive X-ray angiography and coronary computed tomography angiography are established gold standards for coronary luminography. However, they expose patients to invasive complications, ionizing radiation, and iodinated contrast agents. Among a number of imaging modalities, coronary cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) angiography may be used in some cases as an alternative for the detection and monitoring of coronary arterial stenosis, with advantages including its versatility, excellent soft tissue characterization, and avoidance of ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast agents. In this review, we explore the recent advances in motion correction, image acceleration, and reconstruction technologies that are bringing coronary CMR angiography closer to widespread clinical implementation.
