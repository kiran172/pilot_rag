Title: Management of Acquired Aural Atresia and Stenosis: A Case Series.

Abstract: Background: Acquired aural atresia and aural stenosis have high recurrence rates, which are challenging for ear, nose, and throat surgeons. This study aimed to discuss the management of acquired aural atresia and aural stenosis to obtain favorable outcomes. Methods: Four representative cases of different etiologies are presented, and a related literature review was conducted. Results: Four patients aged 11 to 63 years were included in this study. Every patient with long-term follow-up (≥1 year) achieved favorable outcomes via pre- and postoperative management. Conclusion: Prevention in clinical practice is conducive to decreasing the incidence of acquired aural stenosis and aural atresia. Surgical techniques and postoperative management determine operative success. External auditory canal support is indispensable, and local corticosteroid injections in the early stage are beneficial for the management of restenosis.
