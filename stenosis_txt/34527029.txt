Title: Association between non-culprit healed plaque and plaque progression in acute coronary syndrome patients: an optical coherence tomography study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Healed plaques are frequently found in patients with acute coronary syndrome, but the prognostic value is debatable. This study investigated the clinical features of non-culprit healed plaques detected by optical coherence tomography (OCT) with the aim of predicting plaque progression of healed plaques.
METHODS: This study retrospectively analyzed 113 non-culprit lesions from 85 patients who underwent baseline OCT imaging and follow-up angiography from January 2015 to December 2019. Plaque progression predictors were assessed by multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Among 113 non-culprit lesions, 27 healed plaques (23.9%) were identified. Patients with non-culprit healed plaques had prior antiplatelet therapy (65.0% vs. 33.8%, P = 0.019), hypertension (85.0% vs. 50.7%, P = 0.009), and dyslipidemia (70.0% vs. 41.5%, P = 0.04) which were more frequently than those without healed plaques. The thickness (r = 0.674, P &lt; 0.001), arc ( r = 0.736, P &lt; 0.001), and volume ( r = 0.541, P = 0.004) of healed plaque were correlated with minimum lumen diameter changes. At a mean follow-up of 11.5 months, the non-culprit healed plaques had a lower minimum lumen diameter (1.61 ± 0.46 mm vs. 1.91 ± 0.73 mm, P = 0.016), lower average lumen diameter (1.86 mm vs. 2.10 mm, P = 0.033), and a higher degree of diameter stenosis (41.4% ± 11.9% vs. 35.5% ± 13.1%, P = 0.031) when compared to baseline measurements. The plaque progression rate was higher in the healed plaque group (33.3% vs. 8.1%, P = 0.002), and multivariate analysis identified healed plaques [odds ratio (OR) = 8.49, 95% CI: 1.71-42.13] and lumen thrombus (OR = 10.69, 95% CI: 2.21-51.71) as predictors of subsequent lesion progression.
CONCLUSIONS: Healed plaques were a predictor for rapid plaque progression. The quantitative parameters of healed plaque showed a good agreement with plaque progression. Patients with healed plaque were associated with prior antiplatelet therapy and high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Bifurcation lesions might be the predilection sites of healed plaques.
