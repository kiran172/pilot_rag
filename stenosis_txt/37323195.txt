Title: The New Youngest Case of Grange Syndrome with a Novel Biallelic Pathogenic Variant in YY1AP1.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Grange syndrome (OMIM 602531) is characterized by a constellation of symptoms of hypertension, stenosis, or occlusion of different arteries (including the cerebral, renal, abdominal, and coronary vessels) with a variable occurrence of brachysyndactyly, bone fragility, and congenital heart defects. Learning disabilities were also reported in some cases. Biallelic pathogenic variants in YY1AP1 are associated with the syndrome. Only 14 individuals with this ultra-rare syndrome (12 of them were molecularly confirmed) have hitherto been reported in the literature.
CASE PRESENTATION: We herein describe a 11/2-year-old additional female case of Grange syndrome with hypertension, patent ductus arteriosus, and brachysyndactyly who was subsequently confirmed to carry a novel homozygous frameshift variant (c.2291del; p.Pro764Leufs*12) in the YY1AP1 gene through whole-exome sequencing.
CONCLUSION: This report extends the allelic spectrum in Grange syndrome and helps provide insight into the potential role of YY1AP1 in the regulation of cellular processes.
