Title: Subtotal Cervical Esophagectomy and Anastomosis in an Ostrich (Struthio camelus domesticus).

Abstract: An adult, female, captive ostrich (Struthio camelus domesticus) was referred to a veterinary teaching hospital for a 2-week history of lethargy and a mass effect in the proximal cervical region. Physical examination revealed a fistula in the middle cervical esophagus surrounded by devitalized and necrotic tissue; feed material was found leaking from the site. Cervical radiography identified an esophageal stricture with anterior dilation due to the accumulation of feed. After receiving supportive care for 48 hours, the patient's overall status improved, allowing partial esophagectomy and resection of the affected tissues with end-to-end anastomosis. Postoperative management included fasting for 24 hours, followed by the administration of a liquid hand-rearing formula prepared with commercially available ostrich feed and administered via a feeding tube for 15 days. Proper healing of the surgical site was confirmed by esophagoscopy using a flexible endoscope 17 days after surgery. The ostrich was discharged after 27 days, with no complications recorded within the 180 days of the follow-up period. Partial cervical esophagectomy with end-to-end anastomosis along with pre- and postoperative management provided a successful outcome for the treatment of a fistulated esophageal stricture in a captive ostrich, resulting in full recovery without surgical complications.
