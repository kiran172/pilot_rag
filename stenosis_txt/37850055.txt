Title: Rheumatic mitral valve disease with left atrial myxoma: Unexpected encounter.

Abstract: Rheumatic mitral stenosis associated with left atrial myxoma has been reported previously. We reported an admitted rare case of rheumatic mitral regurgitation with left atrial myxoma. The discrimination between left atrial myxoma and thrombi presents a diagnostic challenge in the presence of rheumatic mitral valve disease.
