Title: Patient-reported outcome measures in cerebrovascular neurosurgery.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The object of this study was to describe the use of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) in cerebrovascular neurosurgery and to outline a framework for incorporating them into future cerebrovascular research.
METHODS: Following the standardized PRISMA guidelines, the authors performed a search of the PubMed and Embase databases in February 2023 using filters to investigate six specific cerebrovascular pathologies/procedures: subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracranial hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, arteriovenous malformation, chronic subdural hematoma, and carotid artery stenosis. PROMs in the identified articles were distinguished and classified as generic, symptom specific, or disease specific.
RESULTS: A total of 259 studies including 51 PROMs were eligible for inclusion in the review. Most of the PROMs were generic or symptom specific. Only 5 PROMs were disease specific, and all of these pertained to stroke or SAH.
CONCLUSIONS: There are only a limited number of disease-specific PROMs available for cerebrovascular pathologies and outcomes. Further validation of existing measures in independent cohorts, expanded incorporation of disease-specific PROMs in prospective trials, and the development of new PROMs specific to cerebrovascular conditions are critical to a better understanding of the impact of cerebrovascular diseases and novel therapies on patient lives.
