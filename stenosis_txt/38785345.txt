Title: Equine intervertebral disc disease with dorsal protrusion and spinal cord compression: A computed tomography, myelography, MRI, and histopathologic case study.

Abstract: A 3-year-old American Saddlebred gelding presented for progressive tetraparesis, ataxia, and cervical hyperaesthesia. Radiographic myelography identified spinal cord compression at C6-7 in neutral, extended, and flexed positions and at C4-5 in the flexed position. CT myelography and postmortem MRI identified severe vertebral canal stenosis/compression at C6-7. MRI further identified severe intervertebral disc herniation at C6-7 with intramedullary changes. Disc protrusion was confirmed macroscopically at postmortem. Lesions consistent with compressive myelopathy were confirmed microscopically at C6-7. This is the first report of equine disc protrusion and myelocompression confirmed by multiple advanced imaging modalities and postmortem examination.
