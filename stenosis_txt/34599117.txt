Title: Management of a complicated 'pacemaker pocket' site infection.

Abstract: Pocket site infection after implantation of a pacemaker is a dreaded complication which requires removing the device and reimplanting it at a contralateral site. Difficulties arise when the patient is dependent on pacing and when there are issues with venous access at the contralateral site. We report a patient with pacemaker pocket site infection with congenital complete heart block managed with explantation of the device, semi-permanent pacing during antibiotic treatment, reimplantation of the device at the contralateral site and management of subtotal subclavian vein stenosis noted during reimplantation.
