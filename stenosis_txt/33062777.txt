Title: Combined Endoscopic Stricturotomy and Balloon Dilation of Strictureplasty Site Stricture in Jejunal Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: Patients who undergo surgical strictureplasty for jejunal Crohn's disease-associated strictures may develop severe stenosis at the inlet and outlet sites of the strictureplasty. There is currently no consensus on the optimal management of these strictureplasty-associated strictures because immunosuppressive medications will be ineffective and surgical reintervention, most commonly with bowel resection, is invasive and may introduce new complications. Endoscopic therapy may sometimes be the only valid option. We present a case of severe strictureplasty inlet and outlet strictures that were successfully treated with combined endoscopic stricturotomy and balloon dilation.
