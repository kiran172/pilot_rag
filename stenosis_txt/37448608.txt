Title: The spectrum and etiologies of lower urinary tract symptoms in postmenopausal women.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Although the prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) is high in the female population, it is even higher in postmenopausal females. The frequency, severity, and etiology of LUTS vary among populations and individuals. This study aimed to define the characteristics of LUTS in postmenopausal women and their underlying etiologies.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Overall, 74 postmenopausal patients presenting with LUTS in the urological outpatient department were included in the study. A detailed evaluation of LUTS and their underlying etiologies was performed. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on age (&lt;65 and ≥65 years), and the variation in different factors was compared across the groups. Variables were compared using the t test and 1-way analysis of variance.
RESULTS: Nocturia was the most common symptom (89.2%) followed by frequency (83.8%). Among voiding LUTS, the most common was a weak stream (63.5%). Frequency, nocturia, urgency, urge urinary incontinence (UI), stress UI, and nocturnal enuresis were more common in patients older than 65 years. Urgency and urge UI were recognized to be the most bothersome symptoms by 37% of the study population followed by straining (32%). The mean storage scores, incontinence scores, and quality of life (QoL) scores for patients younger than 65 years and 65 years or older were 6.9 and 8.5 (p &lt; 0.01), 1.8 and 4.1 (p ≤ 0.01), 4.9 and 6.1, respectively. The most common diagnosis was bladder outlet obstruction due to urethral/meatal stenosis (40.5%) followed by an overactive bladder (32.4%), urinary tract infection (10.8%), cystocele (8.1%), urethral prolapse (4.1%), and urethral caruncle (4.1%).
CONCLUSIONS: Storage LUTS were the most common and increased in both frequency and severity with age. The QoL was also more severely affected in older postmenopausal women. Bladder outlet obstruction due to meatal with or without distal urethral stenosis was the most common underlying cause of LUTS followed by an overactive bladder. Overactive bladder had the most severe impact on patients' QoL among all the etiologies.
