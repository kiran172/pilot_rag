Title: Decoupling Between Pulmonary Artery Diastolic and Wedge Pressure Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coexistent pulmonary hypertension with severe aortic stenosis confers a greater risk of mortality for patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). In this patient population, the impact of significant decoupling between pulmonary artery diastolic and pulmonary capillary wedge, as it relates to clinical risk, remained uncertain.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR and completed pre-procedural and post-procedural invasive hemodynamic assessments with right heart catheterization were retrospectively assessed. The impact of post-TAVR decoupling, defined as a pressure difference ≥3 mmHg, on 2-year all-cause mortality or risk of heart failure admission was analyzed. Among 77 included patients (median age 86 years, 23 men), 16 had post-TAVR decoupling. The existence of post-TAVR decoupling was associated with a higher cumulative incidence of the primary endpoint (44% vs. 7%, P=0.001), with an adjusted hazard ratio of 5.87 (95% confidence interval 1.58-21.9, P=0.008).
CONCLUSIONS: A greater risk of worse outcomes in those with post-TAVR decoupling was observed. A therapeutic strategy for post-TAVR decoupling and its clinical implication need to be created and investigated in the future.
