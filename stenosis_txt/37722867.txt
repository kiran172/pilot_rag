Title: Congenital Meatal Urethral Stenosis in a Female Patient: A Case Report.

Abstract: We present the case of a 6-year-old girl who presented with alterations in the voiding stream. On physical examination, a very small urethral meatus was identified at the expense of a membrane. The renovesical ultrasound showed no alterations. An uroflowmetric study was performed, showing a bladder outlet obstruction pattern. The urethral meatus was calibrated and a ventral meatotomy was performed. The histological study of the resected membrane showed a transitional urethral mucosa with chronic focal inflammation and discrete hyperplasia. The patient evolved favorably, with resolution of the symptoms and no notable complications. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first reported case with a histological study of a congenital meatal urethral stenosis. In the presence of lower urinary tract obstruction, this entity should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Surgical treatment is curative.
