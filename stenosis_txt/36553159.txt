Title: Full-Endoscopic Lumbar Foraminotomy for Foraminal Stenosis in Spondylolisthesis: Two-Year Follow-Up Results.

Abstract: Full-endoscopic lumbar foraminotomy (FELF) under local anesthesia has been developed as a minimally invasive alternative for lumbar foraminal stenosis. Some authors have described this technique for treating various lumbar spondylolisthesis. However, few studies have reported the outcomes of FELF for foraminal stenosis in patients with stable spondylolisthesis. This study aimed to demonstrate the specific technique and clinical outcomes of FELF for foraminal stenosis in patients with spondylolisthesis. Twenty-three consecutive patients with foraminal stenosis and stable spondylolisthesis were treated with FELF. Among them, 21 patients were followed up for 2 years. Full-endoscopic foraminal decompression via the transforaminal approach was performed by a senior surgeon. Clinical outcomes were evaluated using the visual analog pain score (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), and modified MacNab criteria. The VAS and ODI scores significantly improved at the two-year follow-up. The global effects were excellent in six patients (28.6%), good in 13 (61.9%), and fair in two (9.5%). Therefore, all patients showed clinical improvement, with a success (excellent/good) rate of 90.5%. No significant surgical complications or signs of further instability were observed. FELF can be used for foraminal stenosis in patients with stable spondylolisthesis. A specialized surgical technique is required for foraminal decompression of spondylolisthesis.
