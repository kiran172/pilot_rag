Title: Acute Gastric Dilatation: A Retrospective Case Series from a Single Institution.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Acute gastric dilatation (AGD) is a massive distension of the stomach caused by the accumulation of gas, gastric secretions, or food material. AGD is a radiological diagnosis with no clear etiopathogenesis and is often misdiagnosed owing to a lack of clear diagnostic criteria and physician awareness.
CASE PRESENTATION: In this case series, we describe the clinical presentations and outcomes of 4 patients with AGD. Three (75%) of the patients were female, and one (25%) was male. The patients' ages ranged from 53 to 84 years, with an average age of 73.5 years. Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting were the most frequently reported complaints. Two (50%) patients had cancer, one (25%) had an acquired duodenal stenosis, and the fourth patient experienced an ileus.
CONCLUSION: AGD is a surgical emergency with a 50-100% mortality rate; thus, prompt diagnosis and management are crucial. Herein, we describe a case series of AGDs that were diagnosed and managed at our institution. We aim to raise awareness about this fatal yet underrecognized clinical entity.
