Title: Fibroblast growth factor 23 as a biomarker of right ventricular dysfunction in pulmonary hypertension.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) has been associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and heart failure. However, its role in right ventricular (RV) remodeling and RV failure is unknown. This study analyzed the utility of FGF-23 as a biomarker of RV function in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH).
METHODS: In this observational study, FGF-23 was measured in the plasma of patients with PH (n = 627), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n = 59), or LVH with severe aortic stenosis (n = 35). Participants without LV or RV abnormalities served as controls (n = 36).
RESULTS: Median FGF-23 plasma levels were higher in PH patients than in healthy controls (p &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences between PH, DCM, and LVH patients. Analysis across tertiles of FGF-23 levels in PH patients revealed an association between higher FGF-23 levels and higher levels of NT-proBNP and worse renal function. Furthermore, patients in the high-FGF-23 tertile had a higher pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), mean pulmonary artery pressure, and right atrial pressure and a lower cardiac index (CI) than patients in the low tertile (p &lt; 0.001 for all comparisons). Higher FGF-23 levels were associated with higher RV end-diastolic diameter and lower tricuspid annular plane systolic excursions (TAPSE) and TAPSE/PASP. Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed FGF-23 as a good predictor of RV maladaptation, defined as TAPSE &lt; 17 mm and CI &lt; 2.5 L/min/m2. Association of FGF-23 with parameters of RV function was independent of the glomerular filtration rate in regression analysis.
CONCLUSION: FGF-23 may serve as a biomarker for maladaptive RV remodeling in patients with PH.
