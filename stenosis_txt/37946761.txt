Title: Imaging misdiagnosis and clinical analysis of significant hepatic atrophy after bilioenteric anastomosis: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The occurrence of long-term bilioenteric anastomotic stenosis can readily induce liver atrophy and hyperplasia, thereby causing significant alterations in the anatomical and morphological aspects of the liver. This condition significantly hampers the accuracy of preoperative imaging diagnosis, while also exacerbating the complexity of surgical procedures and the likelihood of complications.
CASE SUMMARY: A 60-year-old female patient was admitted to the hospital presenting with recurring epigastric pain accompanied by a high fever. The patient had a history of cholecystectomy, although the surgical records were not accessible. Based on preoperative imaging and laboratory examination, the initial diagnosis indicated the presence of intrahepatic calculi, abnormal right liver morphology, and acute cholangitis. However, during the surgical procedure, it was observed that both the left and right liver lobes exhibited evident atrophy and thinness. Additionally, there was a noticeable increase in the volume of the hepatic caudate lobe, and the original bilioenteric anastomosis was narrowed. The anastomosis underwent enlargement subsequent to hepatectomy. As a consequence of the presence of remaining stones in the caudate lobe, the second stage was effectively executed utilizing ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic catheter drainage. Following the puncture, three days elapsed before the drain tip inadvertently perforated the liver, leading to the development of biliary panperitonitis, subsequently followed by pulmonary infection. The patient and her family strongly refused operation, and she died.
CONCLUSION: The hepatic atrophy-hypertrophy complex induces notable alterations in the anatomical structure, thereby posing a substantial challenge in terms of imaging diagnosis and surgical procedures. Additionally, the long-term presence of hepatic fibrosis changes heightens the likelihood of complications arising from puncture procedures.
