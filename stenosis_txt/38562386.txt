Title: Doppler Sonographic Characteristics and Clinical Outcomes of Diabetic Foot Syndrome: A 5-Year Audit from a Tertiary Hospital in Northern Nigeria.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Diabetes foot syndrome is one of the common complications of diabetes. Detailed information on the clinical and vascular characteristics of patients with diabetic foot disease in relation to the outcome of the care provided to these patients will be useful to policymakers and clinicians in early detection and timely interventions for the prevention of disabling complications.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a review of patients with diabetic foot managed in Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital over 5 years (January 2017-May 2022). The sociodemographic characteristics, Wagner classification of the foot, Doppler sonographic characteristics and clinical outcomes, etc., were reviewed.
RESULTS: A total of 51 patients were reviewed. Males and females accounted for 56.8% and 43.1%, respectively. Twenty-five patients had Wagner grade 4 ulcers, and fewer patients had Wagner grade 1 and 5-foot ulcers. The mean ± standard deviation Doppler arterial intimal media thickness was 1.53 ± 0.33 (range 0.90-2.40 mm). The majority of DFS patients had Doppler sonographic lesions on the right lower limb 28 (54.9%) only, and 11 (21.6%) of the lesions were bilateral. The posterior tibial artery 11 (21.6%) was the most involved arterial segment with plaques, followed by a combination of popliteal and tibial arterial 10 (19.6%) segments. At 6 months, 45.2% had limb amputation, 17.6% healed ulcers, 17.6% delayed wound healing, and 9.8% died.
CONCLUSION: There is an unacceptably high prevalence of poor treatment outcomes, thus, contributing to a huge burden of care to patients living with diabetes. There is a strong association between severe arterial stenosis detected by Doppler ultrasound and higher rates of amputations.
