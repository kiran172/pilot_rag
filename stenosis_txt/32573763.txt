Title: Lessons learned from the Czech uterus transplant trial related to surgical technique that may affect reproductive success.

Abstract: Uterus transplantation is an experimental method in the treatment of infertility in women with congenital or acquired absence of uterus. The majority of uterus transplants worldwide have been performed in women with Mayer-Rokitansky-KÃ¼ster-Hauser syndrome, with neovagina and absent uterus. We report two aspects affecting reproductive success related to the surgical technique of transplantation. The first is the stenosis of vaginal-neovaginal anastomosis between the graft's vaginal rim and the recipient's neovagina. The second is a firm fixation of the uterus close to the pubic symphysis. Both these aspects contribute to the technical difficulty of embryo transfer to the transplanted uterus.
