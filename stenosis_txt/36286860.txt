Abstract: The diagnosis of resistant arterial hypertension allows us to single out a separate group of patients in whom it is necessary to use special diagnostic methods and approaches to treatment. Elimination of reversible factors leading to the development of resistant arterial hypertension, such as non-adherence to therapy, inappropriate therapy, secondary forms of arterial hypertension, leads to an improvement in the patient's prognosis. Most patients with resistant hypertension should be evaluated to rule out primary aldosteronism, renal artery stenosis, chronic kidney disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. The algorithm for examining patients, recommendations for lifestyle changes and a step-by-step therapy plan can improve blood pressure control. It is optative to use the most simplified treatment regimen and long-acting combined drugs. For a separate category of patients, it is advisable to perform radiofrequency denervation of the renal arteries.
