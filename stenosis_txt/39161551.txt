Title: Myocardial Infarction With Non-obstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA): A Case Report and Comprehensive Discussion of Pathophysiology and Risk Factors.

Abstract: Myocardial infarction with non-obstructive coronary arteries (MINOCA) refers to the occurrence of myocardial infarction symptoms and signs despite angiographic findings showing normal or near-normal coronary arteries. Unlike the more commonly recognized myocardial infarction with coronary artery disease (MICAD), MINOCA often has a better prognosis; however, it is not without risk, as it is associated with increased mortality. We present a 72-year-old female who presented to the hospital with acute chest pain. Following a thorough diagnostic workup, including laboratory tests, left heart catheterization, and cardiac imaging, she was diagnosed with MINOCA. This case report provides a comprehensive review of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying MINOCA, such as plaque disruption without significant stenosis, microvascular dysfunction, coronary artery spasm, coronary thrombosis or embolism, and spontaneous coronary artery dissection. Additionally, we explore the associated risk factors, highlighting the unconventional risk factors. MINOCA represents a diverse clinical condition with various causes and complex pathophysiology. The variability underscores the necessity for further research to deepen our understanding of this condition. Enhanced knowledge will lead to better diagnostic and treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
