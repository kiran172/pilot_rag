Title: Neuroform EZ Stents for Hepatic Artery Stenosis After Liver Transplantation: A Single-Center Preliminary Report.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This preliminary study evaluated the safety and effectiveness for off-label use of Neuroform EZ (NEZ) stents in the revascularization of hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine of 489 (5%) OLTs with HAS were managed with NEZ stents between September 2016 and July 2021. Stenting outcomes were evaluated based on the technical success rate, procedure-related complications, and primary patency.
RESULTS: A total of 10 NEZ stents (4.5 mm × 3 cm, n = 6; 4 mm × 3 cm, n = 4) were successfully deployed in 9 torturous hepatic arteries and in 1 relatively straight artery without any procedure-related complications. Combined thrombolysis (n = 3) and balloon angioplasty (n = 6) was performed. The median duration of follow-up was 438 days (range, 120-1126 days). Asymptomatic re-stenoses were detected in 2 stents on days 60 and 433 after stenting. A Kaplan-Meier curve predicted cumulative primary stent patencies at 1, 2, and 3 years of 90%, 75%, and 75%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: NEZ stents can be safely used to treat HAS after OLT with high technical success and favorable primary patency.
