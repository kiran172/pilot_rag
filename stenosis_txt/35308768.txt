Title: Deeply Inverted and Biphasic T-Waves of Wellens' Syndrome: A Characteristic Electrocardiographic Pattern Not To Forget.

Abstract: Wellens' syndrome refers to specific electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities of deeply inverted T-waves in the precordial leads, mainly V1-V3, associated with critical stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Identifying this specific pattern on the electrocardiogram is important as emergent treatment can prevent life-threatening myocardial infarction. We present a case of Wellens' syndrome that had a combination of inverted and biphasic T-waves patterns and where timely identification of the abnormal ECG pattern by the emergency physician and prompt intervention by the cardiology team prevented the development of myocardial infarction and hence permanent damage to the heart.
