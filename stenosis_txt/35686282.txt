Title: Invasive Management of Vertebrobasilar Artery Stenosis and Occlusion: A Meta-Analysis on Efficacy and Safety Endpoints.

Abstract: Vertebrobasilar angioplasty and stenting or mechanical thrombectomy (MT) using a stent retriever or suction thrombectomy are effective interventions in managing acute ischemic stroke caused by vertebrobasilar artery occlusion (VBAO). This study aims to investigate the safety and efficacy of self-expanding stents and balloon angioplasty in managing ischemic stroke. We reviewed the literature for relevant clinical trials and included those reporting the following primary outcomes: successful recanalization, favorable clinical outcome, and stenosis degree change. We included 24 studies (858 patients). In the subgroup analysis, participants were divided into three main subgroups based on the type of intervention: mechanical thrombectomy (MT), percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting (PTAS), and MT+PTAS. Regarding overall mortality, the incidence was 34.5%, 9.9%, and 28.9% in the MT, PTAS, and MT+PTAS groups, respectively. The incidence of arterial dissection was 3.6% in the MT group, 3.1% in the PTAS group, and 16.7% in the MT+PTAS group. Incidence of distal embolization, MT, PTAS, and MT+PTAS groups had 3.4%, 5.8%, and 9.5% incidence rates, respectively. Favorable clinical outcomes were reported in 42.8% of subjects in the MT+PTAS group, 64.7% in the PTAS group, and 39.2% in the MT group. The incidence of intracranial hemorrhage was 5.2%, 4.5%, and 15.3% in the MT, PTAS, MT + PTAS groups, respectively. The incidence of successful recanalization was 85.3% in the MT group, 99.4% in the PTAS group, and 92.7% in the MT+PTAS group. Our analysis concludes that PTAS is the most effective intervention for VBAO and is associated with a lower rate of mortality compared to mechanical thrombectomy alone.
