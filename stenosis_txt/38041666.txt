Title: First-in-human trial of a self-expandable, temporary dilation system for intracranial atherosclerotic disease in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) significantly contributes to ischemic stroke, especially among Asian populations. Large vessel occlusion (LVO) due to underlying ICAD accounts for 15-35% of acute ischemic stroke cases requiring endovascular therapy. However, the successful recanalization rate of ICAD-related LVO remains lower. The TG dilator is a self-expandable device, temporarily dilating ICAD-related blocked blood vessels.
OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate TG dilator safety and efficacy for ICAD-related acute ischemic stroke.
METHODS: This was a single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, prospective, multicenter, and investigator-initiated trial that involved patients undergoing TG dilator application for acute ischemic stroke caused by ICAD-related LVO or severe stenosis.
RESULTS: We enrolled 10 patients in this trial between November 2022 and April 2023. The median (IQR) age was 68 (59.3-75.3) years. Before using the dilator, seven patients received stent retriever treatment. All 10 patients were prescribed a loading dose of aspirin with prasugrel. The median application time was 10 (10-12) min. At the end of the procedure, we achieved significant recanalization immediately in all patients. The stenosis/occlusion decreased from 100% (100-100) to 68% (56.3-75.3). No patient experienced recurrent ischemic stroke or reocclusion within 90 days. We achieved a modified Rankin scale score of 0-2 in 8 patients by day 90. We detected no cases of intracranial hemorrhage, equipment failure, distal embolism, vasospasm, dissection, or perforation requiring intervention.
CONCLUSIONS: Acute revascularization using the TG dilator on patients with ICAD-related LVO or severe stenosis did not cause any significant adverse event, and consistently improved blood flow at 90 days.
