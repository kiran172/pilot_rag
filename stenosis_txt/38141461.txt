Title: A Novel System for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: First-in-Man Study.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become a therapeutic treatment for severe symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis. This study aimed to test a novel transcatheter aortic self-expandable bioprosthesis-the ScienCrown system (Lepu Medtech Inc., Beijing, China)-and evaluate the safety of the new device during TAVI. ScienCrown aortic valve implantation was performed on 10 patients. Clinical assessment was performed at baseline, post procedure, and after 1 year. Clinical outcomes and adverse events were assessed according to Valvular Academic Research Consortium-3 criteria. The mean age was 75.30 ± 4.78 years with a mean Society of Thoracic Surgeons score of 4.64 ± 3.23%. Device success was achieved in all patients (80% transfemoral, 20% transapical). After 1 year, there were no deaths, disabling strokes, myocardial infarctions, conversions to surgery, or major procedure-related complications. New pacemaker implantation was required in one patient (10%). ScienCrown implantation resulted in a reduction in mean valve gradient (63.00 ± 18.84 to 9.67 ± 4.97 mm Hg, p &lt;0.001) and an increase in effective orifice area (0.57 ± 0.20 to 2.57 ± 0.59 cm2, p &lt;0.001) at 1 year. Paravalvular leak was absent in 9 patients (90%), and there was a trace in one patient (10%). All patients were in New York Heart Association class I to II at a mean follow-up of 1 year. The experience showed that ScienCrown transcatheter aortic valve system was safely and successfully implanted for treatment of severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. The newer-generation device affords a stable implantation while providing optimal hemodynamic performance.
