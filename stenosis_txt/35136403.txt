Title: Coarctation of the abdominal aorta associated with renovascular hypertension and incapacitating claudication: repair with iliac-birenal bypass and paving and cracking technique.

Abstract: Coarctation of the abdominal aorta is a rare etiology of intermittent claudication and refractory hypertension. Treatment is complex and requires knowledge of several vascular reconstruction techniques. We report a case of aortic coarctation at the level of the renal arteries, describing its treatment and presenting a literature review. Female patient, 65 years old, with refractory hypertension since the age of 35, using five antihypertensive medications at maximum doses. Blood pressure was 260/180mmHg and she had disabling claudication (less than 20 meters). Computed tomography angiography showed a 4mm coarctation in the juxtarenal aorta, with circumferential calcification at the stenosis site, and tortuous infrarenal aorta. Hybrid repair was performed with an iliac-birenal bypass and implantation of an Advanta V12 stent at the stenosis site. The patient's postoperative course was satisfactory, she was free from claudication, and her blood pressure 60 days after surgery was 140/80mmHg, taking two antihypertensive medications.
