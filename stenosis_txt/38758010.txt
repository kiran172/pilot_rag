Title: Robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction - How should success be determined?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) is characterised by stenosis of the ureteral lumen at the level of the renal pelvis and proximal ureter. At Haukeland University Hospital, robotic-assisted laparoscopic pyeloplasty (RLP) for UPJO has been performed since 2014. The aim of this study was to evaluate the results of the treatment and consider what determines treatment success.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective review was performed of consecutive patients undergoing RLP between 2014-2022. Outcomes of interest included symptom relief, complication rates and renographic findings at follow-up. Treatment success was defined in terms of symptom improvement and/or improvement as well as relief of obstruction on renography.
RESULTS: In total, 95 RLPs were performed in 54 women and 41 men, with a mean age of 40 years (IQR: 21-58). Flank pain was the most frequent presenting complaint (n = 81, 85%) followed by infection (n = 33, 35%). More than one indication for surgery was present in 1/3 of the patients. Urodynamic relevant obstruction on renography was found in 62 patients (65%) preoperatively. Mean operative time was 123 minutes (range 60-270). Two patients experienced minor intraoperative complications. At three months follow-up, 91% of patients had symptom relief, and no obstruction on renography was recorded in 64%. There was no significant association between improvement in symptoms and renography findings at follow-up, p = 1.
CONCLUSIONS: RLP can deliver a high success rate in terms of symptom relief and few complications. There was no association between renography findings and symptom relief at follow-up. Success after surgery should be determined by symptom relief rather than renography findings.
