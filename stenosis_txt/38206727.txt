Title: Analysis of postoperative complications in children treated for moderate to severe anal atresia with laparoscopic versus open surgery: A retrospective study.

Abstract: This study aimed to compare and analyze the postoperative complications and anal function after 3-stage laparoscopic-assisted anorectoplasty (LAARP) and conventional posterior sagittal anorectoplasty (PSARP) in the treatment of moderate to severe anal atresia in children. A total of 27 children with moderate to severe anal atresia who underwent conventional PSARP at the Dongguan Children Hospital between 2007 and 2011 were included in the control group, and 34 children with moderate to severe anal atresia who underwent 3-stage LAARP between 2012 and 2016 were included in the observation group. The incidence of postoperative complications and Kelly score of anal function in the 2 groups were statistically analyzed and the efficacy of the 2 procedures compared. The incidence of postoperative complications such as wound infection, anal stenosis, anastomotic leakage, fecal incontinence, and constipation in the LAARP group was lower as compared with the PSARP group, and there was a statistically significant difference (P < .05). There was no significant difference in the incidence of postoperative complications such as rectal prolapse, diarrhea, and recurrent fistula between the LAARP group and the PSARP group (P > .05). The Kelly score of anal function was higher in the LAARP group than in the PSARP group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < .05). Compared to conventional PSARP, laparoscopic surgery for moderate to severe anal atresia in children has less complications, improved anal function, and a clear therapeutic impact.
