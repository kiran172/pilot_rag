Title: Prognostic Impact of High-Molecular-Weight von Willebrand Factor Multimer Ratio in Classical Low-Flow Low-Gradient Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: High-molecular-weight (HMW) von Willebrand factor (VWF) multimer deficiency occurs in classical low-flow, low-gradient (LF/LG) aortic stenosis (AS) due to shear force-induced proteolysis. The prognostic value of HMW VWF multimer deficiency is unknown. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the impact of HMW VWF multimer deficiency on clinical outcome.
METHODS: In this prospective research study, a total of 83 patients with classical LF/LG AS were included. All patients underwent dobutamine stress echocardiography to distinguish true-severe (TS) from pseudo-severe (PS) classical LF/LG AS. HMW VWF multimer ratio was calculated using densitometric Western blot band quantification. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Mean age was 79 ± 9 years, and TS classical LF/LG AS was diagnosed in 73% (n = 61) and PS classical LF/LG AS in 27% (n = 22) of all patients. Forty-six patients underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) and 37 were treated conservatively. During a mean follow-up of 27 ± 17 months, 47 deaths occurred. Major bleeding complications after AVR (10/46; 22%) were more common in patients with HMW VWF multimer ratio &lt;1 (8/17; 47%) in comparison to patients with a normal multimer pattern (2/29; 7%) at baseline (p = 0.003). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, HMW VWF multimer deficiency was a predictor of all-cause mortality (HR: 3.02 [95% CI: 1.31-6.96], p = 0.009) in the entire cohort. This association was driven by higher mortality rates in the AVR group (multivariable-adjusted HR: 9.4; 95% CI 2.0-43.4, p = 0.004).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate the predictive value of HMW VWF multimer ratio for risk stratification in patients with classical LF/LG AS. HMW VWF multimer deficiency was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and major bleeding complications after AVR.
