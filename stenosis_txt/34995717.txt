Title: A systematic review of cognitive function after carotid endarterectomy in asymptomatic patients.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Asymptomatic carotid stenosis has been associated with a progressive decline in neurocognitive function. However, the effect of carotid endarterectomy (CEA) on this process is poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate preoperative and postoperative cognitive function changes in asymptomatic patients after CEA.
METHODS: A systematic review of the existing reports in PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochran databases was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis statement recommendations. All original retrospective or prospective studies (including cohort, cross-sectional, case-control, pilot studies, etc) and clinical trials that compared pre and postoperative neurocognitive function in asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis after CEA, which were published from January 2000 to April 2021 were identified and considered eligible for inclusion in the study.
RESULTS: Thirteen studies (502 CEAs) comparing cognitive function changes before and after CEA were identified. In 7 studies with a total 272 patients, a mean age range of 67.3 ± 4.8 to 76.35 years old, and follow-up ranging between 1 and 12 months, overall cognitive function improved after CEA. However, in 6 studies with a total sample of 230, a mean age range of 68.6 ± 6.9 to 74.4 ± 6.1 years, and follow-up ranged from 24 hours to 3 years, showed no change or decline in overall cognitive function after procedures.
CONCLUSIONS: The lack of standardization of specific cognitive tests and cognitive function assessment timing after CEA does not allow for definite conclusions to be made. However, improving brain perfusion with a combination of CEA and statin therapy may be a protective strategy against cognitive function decline.
