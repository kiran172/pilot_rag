Title: The interaction of persistent antiphospholipid antibodies positivity and cigarette smoking is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positivity was suggested as a nontraditional risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) and it was associated with cigarette smoking. The co-occurrence of them was usually reported in individuals with cardiovascular diseases. This study was to demonstrate their interaction on the increasing risk of cardiovascular events.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 826 consecutive male individuals who underwent coronary angiography (CAG) /percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were prospectively followed and classified into three groups based on different smoking statuses. The current smoking subjects had the highest occurrence of aPL-positivity, including aCL IgM (20.1%) and aβ2GP1 IgM (15.5%). IgM isotype positivity was an independent risk factor of CAD in the multivariate model, OR: 2.70 (1.52-4.80) for aCL IgM and OR:2.50 (1.35-4.63) for aβ2GP1 IgM.The interaction of current smoking and IgM isotype positivity was significantly associated with increased risk of CAD, OR: 8.75(4.59-16.66) for aCL IgM and OR: 8.78(4.28-17.98) for aβ2GP1 IgM. During about 3 years of follow-up, the smoking patients carrying persistent aPL positivity had the highest cumulative incidence of recurrent myocardial infarction and in-stent restenosis after CAD.
CONCLUSION: The interaction of current smoking and IgM isotype positivity was significantly associated with the increased risk of CAD, including positive aCL IgM and aβ2GP1 IgM. Cigarette smoking elevated the risk of subsequent cardiovascular events in the presence of IgM isotype positivity, including recurrent myocardial infarction and in-stent restenosis.
