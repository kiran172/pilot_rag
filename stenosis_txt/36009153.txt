Title: Long-Term Outcomes of Local Tirofiban Infusion for Intracranial Atherosclerosis-Related Occlusion.

Abstract: Local tirofiban infusion has been reported as a rescue strategy for intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS)-related stroke. However, the long-term outcomes of local tirofiban infusion during endovascular reperfusion therapy (ERT) for ICAS-related stroke are still uncertain. This study aimed to investigate the long-term outcomes of local tirofiban infusion during ERT. We retrospectively analyzed acute patients with ICAS-related stroke who were treated with local tirofiban as a rescue strategy during ERT. The primary outcomes were ischemic stroke, transient ischemic stroke (TIA), and stroke-related death within 30 days. Secondary outcomes included ischemic stroke and TIA beyond 30 days and up to 2 years after ERT in the corresponding treated vessel, symptomatic brain hemorrhage, any stroke, and non-stroke-related death. During a median follow-up of 24.0 months, 12 patients developed an ischemic stroke and TIA (4 within 30 days and 8 afterward). The 1-year risk of stroke and TIA was 9.2% (95% confidence interval, 8.0-18.6%). This study demonstrates that 1-year outcomes of local tirofiban infusion were comparable to the results of intracranial stenting in patients with symptomatic ICAS. Local tirofiban infusion for ICAS-related stroke may be a feasible rescue strategy that can have a bridging role until the maximum effect of antiplatelet agents is achieved.
