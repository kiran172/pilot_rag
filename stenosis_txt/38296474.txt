Title: Successful Treatment of Malignant Lymphoma Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: A 67-year-old woman with severe aortic stenosis (AS) was transferred to our hospital for large B-cell lymphoma treatment. Because of her high risk of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity due to severe AS and low performance status, the patient was initially treated with doxorubicin-free chemotherapy. However, doxorubicin was considered necessary to achieve complete remission. After multidisciplinary team discussions, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) was performed without complications. Nine days after TAVR, the patient received the first cycle of anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (R-CHOP). Currently, 12 months after completing 4 cycles of R-CHOP, the patient remains in complete remission without having developed cardiotoxicity.
