Title: Effect of Sport Activity on Uncomplicated Bicuspid Aortic Valve: Long-Term Longitudinal Echocardiographic Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital heart defect that can lead to certain complications (aortic stenosis, regurgitation, dilatation and endocarditis), the diagnosis and clinical monitoring of which are effectively entrusted to transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). The impact of training on the natural history of the disease remains unclear.
METHODS: A retrospective cohort of athletes with uncomplicated BAV aged 18-50 years, who underwent at least 2 TTEs with a minimum follow-up of 5 years, subdivided according to the level of physical activity during follow-up into ''untrained'' and ''trained'', was collected.
RESULTS: 47 athletes (87.3% male, median 21.0, (18.0; 33.0) years) were included. Median follow-up was 11.6 (8.4; 16.3) years. No statistically significant difference in the growing rate of aorta, left ventricle, nor a significant worsening of aortic stenosis and regurgitation was found. Moreover, there was no significant correlation between weekly training minutes during follow-up and the echocardiographic parameters related to heart size and function.
CONCLUSIONS: In BAV without major complications, high training volumes do not correspond to a more rapid and significant deterioration in valve function nor to a more rapid increase in aortic or cardiac chamber size.
