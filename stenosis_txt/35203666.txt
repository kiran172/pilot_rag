Title: Purinergic Receptor P2Y2 Stimulation Averts Aortic Valve Interstitial Cell Calcification and Myofibroblastic Activation.

Abstract: Rationale-Calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) is a pathological condition of the aortic valve with a prevalence of 3% in the general population. It is characterized by massive rearrangement of the extracellular matrix, mostly due to the accumulation of fibro-calcific deposits driven by valve interstitial cells (VIC), and no pharmacological treatment is currently available. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of P2Y2 receptor (P2RY2) activation on fibro-calcific remodeling of CAVS. Methods-We employed human primary VICs isolated from CAVS leaflets treated with 2-thiouridine-5'-triphosphate (2ThioUTP, 10 µM), an agonist of P2RY2. The calcification was induced by inorganic phosphate (2 mM) and ascorbic acid (50 µg/mL) for 7 or 14 days, while the 2ThioUTP was administered starting from the seventh day. 2ThioUTP was chronically administered for 5 days to evaluate myofibroblastic activation. Results-P2RY2 activation, under continuous or interrupted pro-calcific stimuli, led to a significant inhibition of VIC calcification potential (p &lt; 0.01). Moreover, 2ThioUTP treatment was able to significantly reduce pro-fibrotic gene expression (p &lt; 0.05), as well as that of protein α-smooth muscle actin (p = 0.004). Conclusions-Our data suggest that P2RY2 activation should be further investigated as a pharmacological target for the prevention of CAVS progression, acting on both calcification and myofibroblastic activation.
