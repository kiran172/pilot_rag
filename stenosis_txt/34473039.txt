Title: Concomitant Transapical Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Transapical Balloon Mitral Valvuloplasty to Treat Severe Aortic Stenosis with Severe Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: This paper reports concomitant transapical transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TA-TAVR) and transapical balloon mitral valvuloplasty (TA-BMV) for the first time. A 72-year-old man with a diagnosis of rheumatic severe aortic stenosis with mild insufficiency and rheumatic severe mitral stenosis with mild insufficiency was referred to the Department of Cardiac Surgery of Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital. After the interdisciplinary discussion in the heart team (cardiac surgeon, cardiologist, anesthesiologist and image specialist), we decided to perform concomitant TAVR and BMV through one transapical approach considering the patient's preference, NYHA class IV heart failure, and the calculated perioperative risk (Euroscore II 3.74%, STS score for the combined mitral and aortic procedure is not available). No intraoperative or postoperative complications were observed.
