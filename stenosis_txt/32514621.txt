Title: How I do it? Extraforaminal lumbar interbody fusion assisted with biportal endoscopic technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The biportal endoscope-assisted unilateral foraminal approach is an option for various foraminal pathologies. Lumbar interbody fusion is the standard treatment for foraminal stenosis because both direct and indirect neural decompressions can be obtained.
METHOD: We used the biportal endoscopic technique for extraforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (BE-EFLIF) and have described the steps, with discussion regarding the indications, advantages, possible complications, and ways to overcome complications.
CONCLUSION: BE-EFLIF achieves direct neural decompression of lateral spinal canal under endoscopic visualization. It achieves indirect neural decompression using a large footprint lordotic interbody cage, while preserving the lumbar posterior arch as much as possible.
