Title: Long-Term Survival and Quality of Life Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in Nonagenarians.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a successful treatment option for severe aortic stenosis. However, the long-term outcomes of TAVR in nonagenarians is lacking. We aimed to examine the long-term mortality and quality of life in nonagenarians after TAVR. This is a multicenter, retrospective analysis on patients with severe aortic stenosis who underwent TAVR. Patients were divided into 2 groups: nonagenarians (age ≥90 years) and age <90 years. The Kansas City cardiomyopathy questionnaire (KCCQ) and New York Heart Association (NYHA) scores were compared before and after TAVR. All-cause mortality was compared between both groups at 30 days, 1 year, and 5 years after TAVR using the Cox proportional hazard model. A total of 6,896 patients were included, of whom 591 were nonagenarians. Nonagenarians had a higher Society of Thoracic Surgeons perioperative risk of mortality (8.1 ± 4.6% vs 5.4 ± 4.2%, p <0.001) before TAVR. Both groups were similar in KCCQ and NYHA scores at baseline. At 1 year after TAVR, there was no significant difference in improvement in the KCCQ overall score between those aged <90 years and nonagenarians (-4.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] -11.4 to 1.9, p = 0.161). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in improvement in NYHA class between the 2 groups at 1 year (odds ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.25), p = 0.526). The unadjusted 30-day (3.2% vs 2.7%, hazard ratio 1.11, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.80, p = 0.667) and 5-year (28.0% vs 26.6%, hazard ratio 1.05, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.24, p = 0.60) all-cause mortality were similar between the 2 groups. In conclusion, this study demonstrates an excellent long-term mortality rate at 5 years after TAVR in nonagenarians, comparable to patients younger than 90 years. There is a significant and enduring improvement in functional status in nonagenarians, observed up to 1 year after TAVR.
