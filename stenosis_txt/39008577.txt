Title: Modern approaches to ultrasonographic assessment of carotid plaque in terms of its potential instability.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Aim: To identify potentially adverse characteristics of atherosclerotic carotid plaque in terms of stroke risk.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Materials and Methods: The study is based on the analysis of US data obtained from 96 patients aged 47 to 84 years diagnosed with carotid stenosis. The patients were divided into 2 groups depending on the presence or absence of ischemic events. Examination methods: clinical, duplex US, brain MRI, statistical. In addition to the standard US criteria for the evaluation of carotid stenoses, superb microvascular imaging (SMI) and shear wave elastography (SWE) are used.
RESULTS: Results: Statistically significant association of the following characteristics of plaques with the presence of ipsilateral ischemia focus was established: maximum thickness (p = 0,04), presence of microvascularization according to SMI data (p = 0,02), degree of carotid stenosis (statistically significant in the right carotid circulation [p = 0,04]), stiffness of the plaque according to SWE data (significantly in the right carotid circulation [p = 0,001]), type of plaque echogenicity according to Gray-Weale-Geroulakos classification (on the right carotid artery; p = 0,04).
CONCLUSION: Conclusions: The presence of microvascularization according to SMI data and the low stiffness of the plaque according to SWE data can characterize the potential instability of the carotid plaque. These criteria should be added to the traditional US assessment of carotid plaques.
