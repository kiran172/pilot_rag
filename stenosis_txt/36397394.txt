Title: The prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease ready for antireflux surgery.

Abstract: Coronary atherosclerosis (CAS) and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) share common risk factors. The existing CAS may not only increase the possibility of GERD to be refractory GERD (RGERD), but also increase the risk of antireflux surgery for these patients. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of CAS and its potential risk factors in patients with RGERD ready for antireflux surgery. The retrospective analysis was performed in the digestive disease center of Suining Central Hospital, a teritary hospital in Sichuan, China. Records of patients with RGERD admitted to the hospital for antireflux surgery between July 2018, and June 2021 were included. The included patients were divided into the RGERD group and RGERD-CAS group based on the coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) results, which were defined as no CAS and CAS (<50% mild stenosis or ≥50% significant stenosis). In total, 448 patients with RGERD qualified for the study. The prevalence of CAS in these patients was 45.1%. Specifically, 246 patients (54.9%) were in the RGERD group, and 202 patients (45.1%) were in the RGERD-CAS group. Among these 202 patients with CAS, 120 patients (59.4%) had mild CAS (<50% stenosis), 82 patients (40.6%) had significant CAS (≥50% stenosis). Five independent risk factors, including male sex, high blood pressure (HBP), diabetes mellitus (DM), Barrett's esophagus (BE) and family history of coronary artery disease were identified for the occurrence of CAS in patients with RGERD ready for antireflux surgery after adjusting for other factors. CAS is prevalent in patients with RGERD ready for antireflux surgery. Routing CTTA was suggested to exclude potential coronary artery disease in RGERD patients ready for antireflux surgery with independent risk factors.
