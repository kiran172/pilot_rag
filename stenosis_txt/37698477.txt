Title: Prognostic Value of Coronary CT Angiography-derived Fractional Flow Reserve on 3-year Outcomes in Patients with Stable Angina.

Abstract: Background The prognostic value of coronary CT angiography (CTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) beyond 1-year outcomes and in patients with high levels of coronary artery calcium (CAC) is uncertain. Purpose To assess the prognostic value of coronary CTA-derived FFR test results on 3-year clinical outcomes in patients with coronary stenosis and among a subgroup of patients with high levels of CAC. Materials and Methods This study represents a 3-year follow-up of patients with new-onset stable angina pectoris who were consecutively enrolled in the Assessing Diagnostic Value of Noninvasive CT-FFR in Coronary Care, known as ADVANCE (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02499679) registry, between December 2015 and October 2017 at three Danish sites. A high CAC was defined as an Agatston score of at least 400. A lesion-specific coronary CTA-derived FFR value of 2 cm with distal-to-stenosis value at or below 0.80 represented an abnormal test result. The primary end point was a composite of all-cause death and nonfatal spontaneous myocardial infarction. Event rates were estimated using the one-sample binomial model, and relative risk was compared between participants stratified by results of coronary CTA-derived FFR. Results This study included 900 participants: 523 participants with normal results (mean age, 64 years ± 9.6 [SD]; 318 male participants) and 377 with abnormal results from coronary CTA-derived FFR (mean age, 65 years ± 9.6; 264 male participants). The primary end point occurred in 11 of 523 (2.1%) and 25 of 377 (6.6%) participants with normal and abnormal coronary CTA-derived FFR results, respectively (relative risk, 3.1; 95% CI: 1.6, 6.3; P &lt; .001). In participants with high CAC, the primary end point occurred in four of 182 (2.2%) and 19 of 212 (9.0%) participants with normal and abnormal coronary CTA-derived FFR results, respectively (relative risk, 4.1; 95% CI: 1.4, 11.8; P = .001). Conclusion In individuals with stable angina, a normal coronary CTA-derived FFR test result identified participants with a low 3-year risk of all-cause death or nonfatal spontaneous myocardial infarction, both in the overall cohort and in participants with high CAC scores.
