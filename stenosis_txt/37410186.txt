Title: Outcomes of cervical spinal stenosis surgery in patients aged ≥ 65 years based on insurance status: a single-center cohort study from a tertiary center in Germany.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The prevalence of degenerative disorders of the spine, such as cervical spinal stenosis with cervical spine myelopathy (CSM) in the geriatric population, has rapidly increased worldwide. To date, there has been no systematic analysis comparing outcomes in older patients suffering from progressive CSM and undergoing surgery depending on their health insurance status. We sought to compare the clinical outcomes and complications after anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) or posterior decompression with fusion in patients aged ≥ 65 years with multilevel cervical spinal canal stenosis and concomitant CSM with special focus on their insurance status.
METHODS: Clinical and imaging data were retrieved from patients' electronic medical records at a single institution between September 2005 and December 2021. Patients were allocated into two groups with respect to their health insurance status: statutory health insurance (SHI) vs. private insurance (PI).
RESULTS: A total of 236 patients were included in the SHI group and 100 patients in the privately insured group (PI) group. The overall mean age was 71.7 ± 5.2 years. Regarding comorbidities, as defined with the age-adjusted CCI, SHI patients presented with higher rates of comorbidities as defined by a CCI of 6.7 ± 2.3 and higher prevalence of previous malignancies (9.3%) when compared to the PI group (CCI 5.4 ± 2.5, p = 0.051; 7.0%, p = 0.048). Both groups underwent ACDF (SHI: 58.5% vs. PI: 61.4%; p = 0.618), and the surgical duration was similar between both groups. Concerning the intraoperative blood transfusion rates, no significant differences were observed. The hospital stay (12.5 ± 1.1 days vs. 8.6 ± 6.3 days; p = 0.042) and intenisve care unit stay (1.5 ± 0.2 days vs. 0.4 ± 0.1 days; p = 0.049) were significantly longer in the PI group than in the SHI group. Similar in-hospital and 90-day mortality rates were noted across the groups. The presence of comorbidities, as defined with the age-adjusted CCI, poor neurological status at baseline, and SHI status, was significant predictor for the presence of adverse events, while the type of surgical technique, operated levels, duration of surgery, or blood loss was not.
CONCLUSIONS: Herein, we found that surgeons make decisions independent of health insurance status and aim to provide the most optimal therapeutic option for each individual; hence, outcomes were similar between the groups. However, longer hospitalization stays were present in privately insured patients, while SHI patients presented on admission with poorer baseline status.
