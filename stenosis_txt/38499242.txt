Title: Analysis of Factors Associated with Lumbar Degenerative Disease Complicated by Baastrup's Disease.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors associated with the occurrence of Baastrup's disease (BA) in patients with lumbar degenerative diseases (LDDs).
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 168 patients with LDDs (including lumbar disc herniation, lumbar spinal stenosis, and lumbar spondylolisthesis) who were treated at our hospital from January 2020 to January 2023, comprising 95 males and 73 females, aged 48-84Â years.Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of Baastrup's disease: those with BA (Group A) and those without BA (Group B).Relevant patient factors were extracted, including age, gender, occupation, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, body mass index, bone density, presence of internal diseases (diabetes, hypertension), lumbar lordosis angle, endplate Modic changes, degree of intervertebral disc degeneration, and facet joint degeneration (Weishaupt grading).Statistical analysis was performed using, Statistical Package for the Social Sciences 26.0 software to compare the differences in these factors between the two groups, and statistically significant results were included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: Univariate analysis indicated that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in terms of gender, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, bone density, presence of internal diseases (diabetes, hypertension), lumbar lordosis angle, and endplate Modic changes (P>0.05),whereas age, occupation, body mass index, degree of intervertebral disc degeneration, and degree of facet joint degeneration showed statistically significant differences (P < 0.05).Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that age, degree of intervertebral disc degeneration, and degree of facet joint degeneration were independent risk factors for the occurrence of BA in patients with LDDs (P < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: BA is relatively common in patients with LDDs, and advanced age, severe intervertebral disc degeneration, and facet joint degeneration are its independent risk factors.
