Title: [Complex endoscopic treatment of a patient with a large adenoma of the major duodenal papilla, choledocholithiasis and stricture of the common bile duct].

Abstract: Incidence of adenomas of the major duodenal papilla has increased in recent years due to widespread endoscopic screening. These adenomas require resection due to high risk of malignant transformation. Currently, minimally invasive endoscopic interventions are often considered as an alternative to surgical treatment. Combination of major duodenal papilla neoplasms with choledocholithiasis and bile duct strictures are particularly difficult for endoscopic treatment. A 56-year-old patient underwent complex endoscopic treatment for a large adenoma of the major duodenal papilla spreading to duodenal walls and distal segment of the common bile duct combined with choledocholithiasis and stricture of the common bile duct. The patient underwent complex minimally invasive treatment with endoscopic lithoextraction, fragment-by-fragment removal of the neoplasm with intra-ductal ablation of residual adenomatous tissue and subsequent staged biliary stenting for the stricture of the common bile duct, as well as stenting of the main pancreatic duct for prevention of pancreatitis. An integrated approach to the treatment of a patient with a large adenoma of the major duodenal papilla, choledocholithiasis and stricture of the common bile duct provided clinical success without complications and the need for long-term rehabilitation.
