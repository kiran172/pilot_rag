Title: Synchronous Carotid Endarterectomy and Anaortic Off-Pump Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: There is ongoing debate regarding the optimal strategy and timing for the surgical management of patients with severe concomitant carotid and coronary artery disease. Anaortic off-pump coronary artery bypass (anOPCAB), which avoids aortic manipulation and cardiopulmonary bypass, has been shown to reduce the risk of perioperative stroke. We present the outcomes of a series of synchronous carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and anOPCAB.
METHODS: A retrospective review was performed. The primary endpoint was stroke at 30 days post-operation. Secondary endpoints included transient ischaemic attack, myocardial infarction and mortality 30 days post-operation.
RESULTS: From 2009 to 2016, 1,041 patients underwent anOPCAB with a 30-day stroke rate of 0.4%. The majority of patients had preoperative carotid-subclavian duplex ultrasound screening and 39 were identified with significant concomitant carotid disease who underwent synchronous CEA-anOPCAB. The mean age was 71±7.5 years. Nine patients (23.1%) had previous neurological events. Thirty (30) patients (76.9%) underwent an urgent operation. For CEA, a conventional longitudinal carotid endarterectomy with patch angioplasty was performed in all patients. For anOPCAB, total arterial revascularisation rate was performed in 84.6% and the mean number of distal anastomoses was 2.9±0.7. In the 30-day postoperative period, there was one stroke (2.63%), two deaths (5.26%), two transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) (5.26%) and no myocardial infarction. Two patients experienced acute kidney injury (5.26%), one of which required haemodialysis (2.63%). Mean length of stay was 11.37±7.9 days.
CONCLUSION: Synchronous CEA and anOPCAB is a safe and effective option for patients' severe concomitant disease. Preoperative carotid-subclavian ultrasound screening allows identification of these patients.
