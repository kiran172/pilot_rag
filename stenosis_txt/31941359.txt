Title: Blood Group Types O and Non-O Are Associated With Coronary Collateral Circulation Development.

Abstract: Blood group types are associated with coronary artery disease. However, data are scarce about the impact of blood group types on coronary collateral circulation. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between the blood group types and coronary collateral circulation. Two hundred and twelve patients who underwent coronary angiography in our department and had a stenosis of â‰¥ 90% in at least one major epicardial vessel were included in our study. Collateral degree was graded according to Rentrop-Cohen classification. After grading, patients were divided into poor coronary collateral circulation (Rentrop grade 0 and 1) and good coronary collateral circulation (Rentrop 2 and 3) groups. The ABO blood type of all participants was determined. The incidence rates of O blood group type were significantly higher in the good coronary collateral group compared to the poor collateral group (37.9% vs 17.1%, P &lt; .001). The O type blood group was an independent predictor of good coronary collateral circulation (odds ratio = 1.83, 95% confidence interval = 1.56-6.18, P = .015). Coronary collateral circulation is associated with blood group types. The O blood group predicts good coronary collateral development among patients with coronary artery disease.
