Title: Iliocaval Skip Stent Reconstruction Technique for Chronic Bilateral Iliocaval Venous Occlusion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To report safety and efficacy of a skip stent technique using nitinol stents in patients with chronic bilateral iliocaval venous occlusions.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 48 consecutive patients (32 men; mean age, 40.7 years; age range, 18-68 years) with chronic bilateral iliocaval obstructions treated using a nonoverlapping stent technique was conducted at a single center. None of the patients had May-Thurner syndrome. Iliocaval confluence was treated by deploying a nitinol stent in inferior vena cava (IVC) and a nitinol stent in each common iliac vein close to the caval stent. Patency of stents was assessed by duplex US at 2 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months and yearly thereafter.
RESULTS: Recanalization and stent reconstruction was technically successful in 47 (98%) patients. The sinus-XL venous stent was used to treat IVC (95 [100%]). Common iliac and external iliac veins were treated with sinus-Venous and VENOVO stents (80 [83%] and 16 [17%] limbs, respectively). External iliac and common femoral veins were treated with sinus-Venous and VENOVO stents (83 [92%] and 7 [18%] limbs, respectively). Early thrombosis (< 30 days) of the iliac vein with stent occurred in 2 limbs. Cumulative primary, assisted primary, and secondary patency rates at 30 months were 74%, 83%, and 97%.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study suggest that leaving a skipped lesion at the level of iliocaval confluence may not adversely affect stent patency. Patency rates were comparable with other reported techniques of stent reconstruction at the level of iliocaval confluence.
