Title: Doppler Ultrasound of the Renal Vasculature.

Abstract: Ultrasound is the first-line imaging modality used in patients with suspected renovascular disease. Common indications include renovascular hypertension and unexplained renal dysfunction. We review the ultrasound imaging findings of various pathologies involving the renal vessels, including the renal arteries (atherosclerotic stenosis, fibromuscular dysplasia, dissection, arteriovenous fistula, and aneurysm) and veins (tumor and bland thrombus as well as vascular compression syndromes). The current role of renal artery stent placement for atherosclerotic stenosis is also discussed.
