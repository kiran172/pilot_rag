Title: Vaginal stenosis in women with cervical or endometrial cancer after pelvic radiotherapy: a cross-sectional study of vaginal measurements, risk for sexual dysfunction and quality of life.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Radiotherapy (RT) for cervical (CC) and endometrial cancer (EC) is known to lead to vaginal stenosis (VS), but the comparison between vaginal anatomical measurements and the risk of sexual dysfunction presents a wide variety of results among the literature. Thus, we sought to assess the prevalence of VS, vaginal measurements, sexual dysfunction and QOL in women with CC and EC submitted to pelvic RT with or without previous surgery.
METHODS: Cross-sectional study that included 61 women with CC and 69 with EC. VS was classified by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects version 5.0 (CTCAE v5.0), sexual function by the validated Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) and QOL by the validated World Health Organization questionnaire (WHOQOL-BREF). Acrylic cylinders were used for vaginal measurements. Uni-/multivariate analyses to address factors associated with VC in both groups were performed.
RESULTS: The prevalence of VS was 79% and 67% within patients with CC and EC, respectively. Vagina length was decreased in both groups without statistical difference (7.2 ± 1.7 vs. 6.6 ± 1.8;p = 0.072). Vaginal diameter was significantly higher (p = 0.047) in women with EC (25.4 ± 6.3) than in those with CC (23.1 ± 5.7). Sexual dysfunction was highly prevalent for both CC and EC (88% vs. 91%; p = 0.598). There was no difference in all WHOQOL-BREF domains between women with CC and EC.
CONCLUSIONS: VS is highly prevalent in CC and EC patients, with vaginal length decreased in both groups but with a higher vaginal diameter in those with EC. Nevertheless, sexual dysfunction is highly prevalent in both groups.
