Title: [Tongdu Tiaoshen acupuncture combined with carotid endarterectomy for carotid artery stenosis: a randomized controlled trial].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical therapeutic effect of Tongdu Tiaoshen acupuncture combined with carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and simple CEA on carotid artery stenosis (CAS).
METHODS: A total of 60 patients with CAS were randomized into an observation group (30 cases, 2 cases dropped off) and a control group (30 cases, 3 cases dropped off). Both groups were treated with eversion CEA (eCEA). The conventional treatment of internal medicine and antiplatelet drugs i.e. aspirin enteric-coated tablet and clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate tablet were given in the control group for 4 weeks. On the basis of the treatment in the control group, Tongdu Tiaoshen acupuncture was applied at Baihui (GV 20), Fengfu (GV 16), Yamen (GV 15), cervical Jiaji (EX-B 2), Dazhui (GV 14), etc. in the observation group, once a day, 1-day rest was taken after 6-day treatment, 2 weeks were as one course and totally 2 courses were required. The carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) before and after treatment was detected by ultrasonic diagnostic apparatus, the TCM symptom score was compared before and after treatment and in the follow-up of 6 months after treatment, the clinical efficacy was evaluated in the two groups. The occurrence of endpoints within 1 year was recorded.
RESULTS: After treatment, the carotid IMT and TCM symptom scores were decreased compared before treatment in the both groups (P&lt;0.05), and the changes in the observation group were greater than the control group (P&lt;0.05). In the follow-up, the TCM symptom scores were decreased compared before treatment in the both groups (P&lt;0.05). The total effective rate was 96.4% (27/28) in the observation group, which was superior to 88.9% (24/27) in the control group (P&lt;0.05). There were 1 case of stoke in the observation group and 2 cases of stroke in the control group within 1-year follow-up, and there was no significant difference in the number of endpoints between the two groups within 1 year (P&gt;0.05).
CONCLUSION: Tongdu Tiaoshen acupuncture combined with CEA can effectively reduce the IMT in patients with CAS, improve the TCM symptom score, the efficacy is superior to simple CEA treatment.
