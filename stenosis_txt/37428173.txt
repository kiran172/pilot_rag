Title: Respiratory involvement in Crohn's disease: a case report.

Abstract: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects the gastro-intestinal tract. There is however a large array of extra intestinal manifestations (EIM) associated with these diseases. A lesser known EIM is pulmonary involvement, which has been first described in 1973. Since the introduction of HRCT more attention is guided towards this specific involvement. Awareness of pulmonary involvement in IBD-patients may lead to better screening, guide appropriate therapy, and ultimately result in better patient care. When untreated, serious and persisting complications, such as stenosis or strictures of the large airways, as well as bronchiectasis or bronchiolitis obliterans might occur.
