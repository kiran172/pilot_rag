Title: Prevention of esophageal stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection of squamous cell carcinoma using a 20-French nasogastric tube combined with oral steroid administration.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophageal stricture is a major complication after esophageal endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) and when the mucosal defect exceeds 3/4 of the circumference. Various preventive methods have been reported to prevent stenosis. However, in the case of circumferential ESD, there is no way to prevent luminal stenosis effectively. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of 20-French nasogastric tubes (NGT) combined with oral steroids for the prevention of esophageal stricture after endoscopic submucosal dissection.
METHODS: Between January 2012 and December 2021, we enrolled 57 patients with post-ESD mucosal defects exceeding 3/4 of the esophageal circumference. Of them, the initial seven patients received oral steroid therapy and the subsequent 50 patients received 20-French NGT placements combined with oral steroid therapy. We retrospectively evaluated the rates of strictures and refractory strictures and explored risk factors for strictures with 20-French NGT.
RESULTS: The overall esophageal stricture rate was 42.1% (24/57). In the noncircumferential group, the esophageal stricture rate in patients with only oral steroid to prevent esophageal stricture was 85.7% (6/7), while the esophageal stricture rate was only 4.3% (1/23) in those with 20-French NGT placements and oral steroid. All 27 patients with whole-circumferential resection received 20-French NGT placements. The stricture rate was 63.0% (17/27), and the refractory stricture rate was 17.6% (3/27).
CONCLUSION: Using a 20-French NGT placement combined with oral steroid administration is an easy and safe alternative to prevent esophageal stricture after ESD, especially for patients with noncircumferential mucosal defects. Further studies are needed to develop an effective stricture prevention method for post-ESD whole-circumferential mucosal defects of the esophagus.
