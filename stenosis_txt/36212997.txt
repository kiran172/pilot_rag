Title: Effect of Risk-Focused Diversified Safety Management Mode in Patients with Major Artery Stent Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) causes a series of neurological symptoms, such as vertigo, impaired consciousness, limb weakness, ataxia, dysphagia, ocular motility disorders, and visual impairment. With the improvement of people's living standards, there are higher requirements for nursing care. Nursing, as an indispensable part of medical care, is closely related to achieving the goal of patient's safety and the overall quality of nurses, quality of care, and nursing management methods.
OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of risk-centered diversified safety management in patients undergoing aortic stenting.
METHODS: Eighty patients with cerebral infarction were selected and treated with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stent implantation (PTAS). Then they were divided into a control group (40 cases) with routine monitoring and an experimental group (40 cases) with risk-focused intervention of a diversified safety management model according to the mode of care. Patient satisfaction and blood index test results were compared after the intervention.
RESULTS: Patients in the experimental group had 6 falls, 3 bed falls, 3 phlebitis, 4 tube slips, and 10 deep vein thrombosis, all significantly fewer than those in the control group. Thirty-eight patients in the experimental group expressed satisfaction with safe management, which was substantially better than the control group (P &lt; 0.05). The levels of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PA1-1), and von Willebrand factor (vWF) in the experimental group were (13.5 ± 1.3) ng/mL, (60.1 ± 9.9) ng/mL, and (2.1 ± 0.2), respectively, which were substantially lower than those in the control group ((14.6 ± 2.4) ng/mL, (64.2 ± 10.7) ng/mL, and (2.8 ± 0.3)), respectively (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The risk-centered diversified safety management model can effectively reduce the probability of adverse events in patients, improve patient satisfaction with nursing services, and promote faster postoperative recovery, which has clinical application value.
