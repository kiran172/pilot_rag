Title: Revisiting carotid endarterectomy: Neobulb technique using external carotid artery as a patch.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study describes an alternative carotid bifurcation endarterectomy technique in which the external carotid artery is used as a suture patch.
METHODS: Charts of ten patients with atherosclerotic carotid stenosis that were treated using the neobulb technique between 2002 and 2019 were reviewed.
RESULTS: No major surgical adverse event was observed in the postoperative assessments. No postoperative common or internal carotid stenosis was observed in the mid- or long-term follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The neobulb technique allows carotid endarterectomy closure without a synthetic or venous patch, using the external carotid artery as an autologous patch, while preserving distal flow into the external carotid artery branches.
