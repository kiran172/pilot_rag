Title: Echocardiography-guided subxiphoidal transapical TAVR in a challenging anatomy: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) via an antegrade transapical access (TA-TAVR) is largely reserved to cases not amenable to transfemoral TAVR. Challenges resulting from unusual thoracic anatomies may require special considerations in terms of the surgical access.
CASE PRESENTATION: We present a case of TA-TAVR through a subxiphoidal approach in a patient who had undergone extensive thoracic surgery 8â€‰years previously.
CONCLUSION: Our case demonstrates that unusual anatomic features should not discourage from TA-TAVR but may require unusual approaches designed on a case-to-case basis following careful interdisciplinary preparation and planning including adequate pre-operative diagnostics and imaging.
