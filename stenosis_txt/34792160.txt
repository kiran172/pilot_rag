Title: Infective aortitis after self-expanding transcatheter valve implantation: a case report of a new reality for cardiac surgeons.

Abstract: A 62-year-old female patient was admitted to hospital care due to an ischaemic stroke and fever of unknown origin, 6 months after a transfemoral aortic valve implantation for symptomatic aortic stenosis. Further study resulted in the diagnosis of infective aortitis, and clinical course deemed prosthesis explantation necessary. In this case report, we describe the technique used to explant the partially endothelized aortic valve and review the alternatives found in literature for safe prosthesis removal.
