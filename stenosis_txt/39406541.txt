Title: [Clinical characteristics of 29 cases of pulmonary mucormycosis treated with and without surgery].

Abstract: Objective: To analyze the clinical characteristics of patients with pulmonary mucormycosis treated with and without surgery. Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective study. We retrieved "pulmonary mucormycosis" from the electronic medical records of China-Japan Friendship Hospital between 2016 and 2022. A total of 29 patients with pulmonary mucormycosis were collected. There were 19 males and 10 females with a median age of 49 (47, 67) years. Mann-Whitney U test, χ² test, Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test were used to compare the differences between groups. Results: The most common underlying disease was diabetes (19, 65.5%). The most frequent imaging findings were consolidation (25, 86.2%) and nodule or mass (21, 72.4%). Bronchial stenosis (16, 55.2%), obstruction by fungal plugs (18, 62.1%), pseudomembranous necrotizing bronchitis (19, 65.5%) were common. Treatment strategies were developed by the multi-disciplinary team (MDT). Among 16 patients who did not undergo surgery, 10 had bilateral multifocal lesions and 6 had unifocal lesions. All patients received antifungal therapies, and surgeries were performed in 13 (44.8%) patients. Patients who underwent surgery had numerically lower in-hospital mortality (15.4% vs. 31.3%, P=0.410). Involvement of unilateral multiple lesions was more common in patients who underwent surgeries (6/13 vs. 1/16, P=0.019). Patients who underwent surgery were more likely to have lobar and segmental bronchial involvement (13/13 vs. 9/16, P=0.007). A total of 15 patients underwent mNGS, 14 (93.3%) had positive results. Performing metagenomic next generation sequencing for diagnosis shortened the time from disease onset to diagnosis (log-rank P=0.014). Conclusion: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing aided early diagnosis. The patients who underwent surgery included unilateral multiple lesions and visualisation of endobronchial abnormalities on lobar or segmental bronchus in unilateral lung.
