Title: Life expectancy after aortic valve replacement in young patients.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: In young patients with severe aortic stenosis, it is unknown whether their life expectancy restored after aortic valve replacement (AVR) is unknown.
METHODS: We analyzed all patients aged between 50 and 65 years who underwent isolated AVR in 27 Spanish centers during an 18-year period. We compared observed and expected survival at 15 years of follow-up. We repeated all analyses for patients without complications in the postoperative period.
RESULTS: A total of 5084 patients were analyzed. For the overall sample, observed survival at 10 and 15 years was 85.3% (95%CI, 84.1%-86.4%) and 73.7% (95%CI, 71.6%-75.6%), respectively. Expected survival was 90.1% and 82.1%. Cumulative relative survival for 1, 5, 10 and 15 years of follow-up was 97.4% (95%CI, 96.9%-97.9%), 96.5% (95%CI, 95.7%-97.3%), 94.7% (95%CI, 93.3%-95.9%), and 89.8% (95%CI, 87.3%-92.1%). For patients without complications, cumulative relative survival for 1, 5, 10 and 15 years was 100.3% (95%CI, 99.8%-100.5%), 98.9% (95%CI 97.6% -99.9%), 97.3% (95%CI, 94.9%-99.4%), and 91.9% (95%CI, 86.5%-96.8%).
CONCLUSIONS: Life expectancy in young patients who have severe aortic stenosis and undergo AVR is lower than that of the general population. Life expectancy of individuals without complications during the postoperative period is also reduced. Therefore, baseline characteristics are likely the main factors that explain the reduction in life expectancy.
