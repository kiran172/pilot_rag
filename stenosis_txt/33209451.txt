Title: Anesthetic considerations for tracheobronchial surgery.

Abstract: Tracheobronchial pathology can be related to trauma, infection, tumor, or a combination of these. Per definition, planning for tracheobronchial surgery can be complicated by the overlap of anesthesiological interests in airway management and the primary surgical field. Therefore, following a detailed description of the stenosis, management of tracheobronchial surgery requires an interdisciplinary discussion and individualized planning of the procedure. There are several options for intraoperative ventilation depending on the exact localization of the defect. Hence, different tubes and ventilation techniques from cross-field ventilation, to jet ventilation, or even spontaneous breathing under regional anesthesia, have to be discussed. Moreover, an innovative ventilation mode called flow-controlled ventilation (FVC) has been developed, which allows to apply standard tidal volumes through a narrow-bore endotracheal tube. In addition, the Ventrain has been developed as an emergency device following the same technique of an active expiration based on the Venturi principle and a controlled gas flow. In critical situations, it allows even ventilation through the working channel of a bronchoscope. Overall, tracheobronchial surgery is performed under total intravenous anesthesia and the aim of an early extubation at the end of surgery. Airway management has to be discussed and planned between surgeon and anesthesiologist. All of the steps of the procedure need constant and clear communication.
