Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Without the Use of Contrast Medium: An Alternative Safe Implantation Technique.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: New transcatheter equipment and accumulated experience have stimulated further refinements in implantation techniques. We aimed to compare the outcomes of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TF-TAVR) with and without the use of contrast medium (CM) in patients with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m².
METHODS: This single-center, retrospective study included all patients who underwent TF-TAVR procedure with Edwards Sapien balloon-expandable bioprostheses between September 2017 and September 2018 at the Zentralklinik Bad Berka Germany, and compared outcomes of TF-TAVR with and without the use of CM.
RESULTS: A total of 98 consecutive patients were included in this study; 25 patients underwent TF-TAVR without the use of CM and 73 patients underwent TF-TAVR with the use of CM. Acute kidney injury was significantly higher in patients who received CM (15 patients [20.5%] in the control group vs 1 patient [4%] in the study group; P=.04). Other procedure-related complications were equally distributed between both groups.
CONCLUSION: TF-TAVR without the use of CM can be considered a safe and reproducible alternative technique. Furthermore, it reduced the incidence of postoperative acute kidney injury in patients with GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m².
