Title: Retrieval of a Dislocated Stent Using a Grasping Forceps and a Steerable Sheath in a Fontan Patient.

Abstract: In Fontan patients, any pulmonary stenosis may impede free passive inflow into the pulmonary circuit and elevate central venous pressure. When stenting such pulmonary stenosis, dislocation of a stent is a feared complication. Here, we report on a successful retrieval of a dislocated Cook Formula stent into the peripheral left pulmonary artery in a Fontan patient with protein-losing enteropathy using a steerable sheath and a grasping forceps. Furthermore, a successful stent implantation for treating the stenosis was possible. Subsequently, we simulated the retraction technique ex vivo. To manage stent dislocation during complex pediatric catheter interventions, we can recommend the use of a steerable sheath guiding a grasping forceps. A dislocated stent can be grasped, completely longitudinally refolded, and safely retrieved.
