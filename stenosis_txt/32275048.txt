Title: Spontaneous bag mask ventilation for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass via mid-sternotomy in patients with severe tracheal stenosis: A series of three patients.

Abstract: In patients with critical tracheal stenosis, particularly involving the lower part of trachea, a highly experienced team of anesthesiologists to tackle the difficulties of securing and maintaining the ventilation, cardiac surgeon who can swiftly establish cardiopulmonary bypass, an experienced surgeon for tracheal reconstruction are a prerequisite for managing these highly complex cases. The present paper describes three patients suffering from severe tracheal narrowing wherein spontaneous bag-mask ventilation was used for establishing cardiopulmonary bypass via mid-sternotomy as a rare life-saving procedure for urgent tracheal reconstructive surgery.
