Title: Use of drug-coated balloon instead of drug-eluting stent for pediatric cardiac allograft vasculopathy.

Abstract: Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV) sometimes leads to restenosis, even after percutaneous transcatheter intervention. Recently, drug-coated balloons (DCBs) have been successfully used to treat coronary artery disease, especially CAVs, in adults. However, no studies have used DCBs in pediatric CAVs. We encountered a patient with CAV who underwent cardiac transplantation for restrictive cardiomyopathy at the age of 2 years. Nine years after the transplantation, severe stenosis of the proximal left anterior descending branch was observed. Considering the patient's young age and the possibility of restenosis, we performed an intervention with DCB. Follow-up conducted 7 months after the intervention showed no restenosis. Cardiac coronary artery lesions following transplantation are more likely to result in restenosis earlier than arteriosclerotic lesions. In pediatric patients, restenosis might require multiple stents and prolonged antiplatelet therapy. Our findings provide evidence supporting the possibility of an effective treatment of CAV in children.
