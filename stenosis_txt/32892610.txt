Title: [Prevalence and predictors of intraplaque hemorrhage in stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the prevalence and predictors of intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) in ischemic stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerosis. Methods: Ischemic stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerosis who were consecutively admitted to Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital from January 2017 to April 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. High-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging was used to assess atherosclerotic plaque characteristics of intracranial artery. Possible variables correlated with IPH were compared between IPH and no-IPH groups, as well as in symptomatic IPH and no symptomatic IPH groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine the predictors of all IPH and symptomatic IPH in intracranial artery. Results: A total of 276 ischemic stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerosis were included, of which, 41.3% (114/276) were IPH-postive, and 28.1%(32/114) of them were symptomatic. In multivariate regression analysis, maximum wall thickness was independently associated with the presence of all IPH and symptomatic IPH (OR=2.15, 95%CI: (1.42-3.24) and OR=3.46, 95%CI: (1.94-6.17), respectively). Conclusion: The prevalence of IPH in ischemic stroke patients with intracranial atherosclerosis is much higher than expected. Moreover, atherosclerosis plaque burden is independently associated with IPH, but it is non-specific in identifying symptomatic IPH.
