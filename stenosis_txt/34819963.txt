Title: Clinical presentation does not affect acute mechanical performance of the Novolimus-eluting bioresorbable vascular scaffold as assessed by optical coherence tomography.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Initial trials of bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (BVS) have mostly excluded patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, these patients might benefit from a BVS platform, in particular as they are often younger and have been less frequently treated than patients with chronic disease.
AIM: To compare the acute performance of a Novolimus eluting BVS in ACS and non-ACS patients using optical coherence tomography (OCT) in patients presenting with acute or chronic coronary syndrome.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The final OCT pullback of 79 patients (34 with ACS, 45 non-ACS) was analysed at 1-mm intervals. The following indices were calculated: mean and minimal area, residual area stenosis, incomplete strut apposition, tissue prolapse, eccentricity index, symmetry index, strut fracture, and edge dissection.
RESULTS: OCT showed a minimum lumen area (non-ACS vs. ACS) of 6.2 ±2.1 vs. 5.6 ±1.5 mm2 (p = 0.21). Mean residual area stenosis was 14.5% vs. 19.5% (p = 0.39). The mean eccentricity index did not differ significantly (0.78 ±0.13 vs. 0.78 ±0.06; p = 0.42). There was a non-significant tendency for more fractures in the non-ACS group (22.2% vs. 5.9%; p = 0.07). Prolapse area was comparable (4.4 ±7.4 mm2 vs. 5.2 ±10.9 mm2; p = 0.62).
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the acute mechanical performance of a Novolimus-eluting BVS in patients with different clinical presentations using OCT. We found that clinical presentation did not determine acute mechanical performance as assessed by the final OCT pullback. There was evidence of more mechanical complications in terms of fractures and a higher percentage of incomplete strut apposition in the group of patients with chronic coronary syndrome.
