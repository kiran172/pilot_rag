Title: Comprehensive Rehabilitation of a Patient With Foot Drop Secondary to Lumbar Canal Stenosis: A Case Report.

Abstract: One of the most prevalent degenerative musculoskeletal conditions is lumbar spinal canal stenosis (LSS), which is characterized by narrowing of the lumbar spinal canal that pressures the nerve roots and cauda equine. LSS, when treated surgically, usually presents with foot drop as its major complication. Foot drop is a common presentation of several clinical diseases, traditionally characterized as severe weakening of ankle and toe dorsiflexion. Foot drop has a great impact on patients' lives, lowering their quality of life and affecting their activities of daily living. Ankle dorsiflexion weakness leads to foot drop and a high-stepping gait, which can cause multiple falls and accidents. This case study aimed to assess the efficacy of a customized physiotherapy program in a 50-year-old woman with paraparesis along with left foot drop and post-surgery complications following lumbar decompression and spinal fusion at L3-S1 (lumbar-sacral) level after a jerk experienced by her while working out in the gym. The objective was to determine the impact of individualized exercises on the patient's strength, gait, balance, and pelvic floor function over a 12-week rehabilitation period. The interventions included lower limb exercises (stretching exercises, strengthening exercises, and weight-bearing exercises), pelvic floor exercises, and core stability training. The findings demonstrated significant improvements in the patient's functional outcomes, as evidenced by enhanced scores in the Berg Balance Scale, Manual Muscle Testing, Dynamic Gait Index, Barthel Index, and Stanmore Assessment Questionnaire. Notable progress was observed in the strength, balance, gait, and pelvic floor function, highlighting the positive influence of targeted physiotherapeutic interventions. This case underscores the importance of tailored exercise plans in addressing the complexities of post-surgery challenges, emphasizing the potential for comprehensive recovery and improved overall quality of life through personalized physiotherapy.
