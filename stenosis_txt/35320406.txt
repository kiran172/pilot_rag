Title: Left atrial function index (LAFI) and outcome in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Clinical data regarding the association between the left atrial function index (LAFI) and outcome in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are limited.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association between the left atrial function index (LAFI) and outcome in patients undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: In this retrospective multicenter study, we assessed baseline LAFI in 733 patients undergoing TAVR for severe aortic stenosis in two German high-volume centers between 2008 and 2019. Based on receiver operating characteristic curves, patients were stratified according to their baseline LAFI into two groups (LAFI ≤ 13.5 vs. LAFI > 13.5) and assessed for post-procedural outcome. The primary endpoint of our study was the 1-year all-cause mortality.
RESULTS: Patients with a LAFI ≤ 13.5 had significantly more often atrial fibrillation (p < 0.001), lower LVEF (p < 0.001) and higher levels of NT-proBNP (p < 0.001). After TAVR, a significant improvement in the LAFI as compared to baseline was observed at 12 months after the procedure (28.4 vs. 32.9; p = 0.001). Compared to patients with a LAFI > 13.5, those with a LAFI ≤ 13.5 showed significantly higher rate of 1-year mortality (7.9% vs. 4.0%; p = 0.03). A lower LAFI has been identified as independent predictor of mortality in multivariate analysis (HR (95% CI) 2.0 (1.1-3.9); p = 0.03).
CONCLUSION: A reduced LAFI is associated with adverse outcome and an independent predictor of mortality in TAVR patients. TAVR improves LAFI within 12 months after the procedure.
