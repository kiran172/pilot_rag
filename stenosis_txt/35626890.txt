Title: Prematurity and Pulmonary Vein Stenosis: The Role of Parenchymal Lung Disease and Pulmonary Vascular Disease.

Abstract: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) has emerged as a critical problem in premature infants with persistent respiratory diseases, particularly bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). As a parenchymal lung disease, BPD also influences vascular development with associated pulmonary hypertension recognized as an important comorbidity of both BPD and PVS. PVS is commonly detected later in infancy, suggesting additional postnatal factors that contribute to disease development, progression, and severity. The same processes that result in BPD, some of which are inflammatory-mediated, may also contribute to the postnatal development of PVS. Although both PVS and BPD are recognized as diseases of inflammation, the link between them is less well-described. In this review, we explore the relationship between parenchymal lung diseases, BPD, and PVS, with a specific focus on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, risk factors, and plausible biological mechanisms in premature infants. We offer an algorithm for early detection and prevention and provide suggestions for research priorities.
