Title: COVID-19 Related Tracheal Stenosis Requiring Tracheal Resection: A Case Series.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To characterize the preoperative and intraoperative findings of symptomatic tracheal stenosis associated with COVID-19 related respiratory failure requiring tracheal resection.
METHOD: We performed a retrospective review identifying all patients with a history of tracheal stenosis secondary to COVID-19 related respiratory failure who subsequently received a tracheal resection at our institution between January 2020 and June 2023. Clinical, radiological, pathological, and surgical characteristics were recorded to describe and characterize pre-operative and intraoperative findings associated with tracheal stenosis in the setting of a previous COVID-19 infection.
RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed 11 patients with COVID-19 related tracheal stenosis that required open tracheal or cricotracheal resection. The mean age was 54.1. Patients were hospitalized for a mean of 49.5 days related to COVID-19 complications. Tracheotomy was completed in 10 patients (90.9%) during their initial hospitalization with COVID-19 related respiratory failure. Patients were intubated a mean of 18.6 days prior to tracheotomy completion. Ten patients (90.9%) underwent endoscopic operative interventions for their tracheal stenosis prior to open resection. Intraoperatively, the mean stenosis length was 3.33 cm. The mean tracheal resection length was 3.96 cm. Patients were hospitalized for a mean of 8.27 days post operatively with no significant post operative complications.
CONCLUSIONS: Symptomatic tracheal stenosis in the setting of prolonged intubation due to COVID-19 is an under-described etiology. This is one of the largest single institution retrospective reviews that identifies 11 patients with prolonged intubation who developed symptomatic tracheal stenosis refractory to conservative management and ultimately requiring tracheal resection.
