Title: Pivotal Evaluation of Novel Dedicated Venous Stent for Iliofemoral Venous Obstruction: A Prospective Cohort Study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The purpose was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of a dedicated venous stent with the tripartite composite segments for the treatment of iliofemoral venous obstruction (IVO) in a mixed cohort of nonthrombotic iliac vein lesion (NIVL) and post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) over a period of 12 months.
METHODS: The Grency Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label, pivotal study, which was conducted at 18 large tertiary hospitals in China from August 2019 to October 2020. A total of 133 hospitalized patients were screened and 110 patients with clinical, etiology, anatomical, and pathophysiology clinical class (CEAP) clinical grade C>3 and iliac vein stenosis >50% or occlusion, including 72 patients with NIVL and 38 patients with PTS, were implanted with Grency venous stents. Primary endpoint was stent patency at 12 months follow-up, and secondary outcomes were technical success; improvement in venous clinical severity score (VCSS) at 3, 6, and 12 month follow-up; and rates of clinical adverse events.
RESULTS: Among 110 patients who were implanted with Grency venous stents, 107 patients completed the 12 month follow-up. All 129 stents were successfully implanted in 110 limbs. Twelve-month primary patency rate was 94.39% [95% confidence interval [CI]=88.19%-97.91%] overall, and 100% [94.94%-100%] and 83.33% [67.19%-93.63%] in the NIVL and PTS subgroups, respectively. Venous clinical severity score after iliac vein stenting improved significantly up to 12 months follow-up. There were 3 early major adverse events (1 intracerebral hemorrhage and 2 stent thrombosis events related to anticoagulation therapy), and 7 late major adverse events (1 cardiovascular death, 1 intracranial hemorrhage with uncontrolled hypertension, and 5 in-stent restenosis cases without stent fractures or migration).
CONCLUSIONS: The Grency venous stent system appeared excellent preliminary safe and effective for IVO treatment. Further large-scale studies with longer-term follow-up are needed to evaluate long-term patency and durability of stent.
CLINICAL IMPACT: The design of venous stents for iliofemoral venous obstruction (IVO) must address engineering challenges distinct from those encountered in arterial stenting. The Grency venous stent, a nitinol self-expanding stent specifically tailored for IVO, features a composite structure designed to meet the stent requirements of various iliac vein segments. The Grency Trial is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm, open-label pivotal study aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of the Grency stent system. Following a 12-month follow-up period, the Grency venous stent system has demonstrated both safety and efficacy in treating iliofemoral venous outflow obstruction.
