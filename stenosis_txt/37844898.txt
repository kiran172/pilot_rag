Title: Eosinophilic enteritis presenting as intestinal obstruction: case report and review of the literature.

Abstract: Eosinophilic enteritis (EE) is characterized by intense eosinophilic infiltrate of the gastrointestinal tract. Clinical manifestations depend on the affected segment and intestinal layer. First-line treatment is systemic corticosteroids; surgery is reserved for complications. 84-year-old male patient with a history of right hemicolectomy and two episodes of intestinal obstruction presented to the ED with abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and vomiting. CBC showed leukocytosis and no eosinophilia. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed stenosis with thickening of the distal intestinal wall and partial intestinal obstruction. Colonoscopy found aphthous ulcers. Histopathology reported EE. The patient received budesonide and metronidazole, with resolution within 24 h.
