Title: Balancing ability of patients with lumbar spinal canal stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine the relationship between postural sway and the severity of lumbar spinal canal stenosis as well as the effect on postoperative improvement.
METHODS: Stabilometry was performed before and 6 months after surgery in 52 patients (29 men and 23 women; mean age, 74.1 ± 7.8 years) who underwent decompression surgery for lumbar spinal canal stenosis. The environmental area (EA; the area surrounding the circumference of the stabilogram) and locus length per EA (L/EA) were evaluated. The patients were divided into moderate (n = 22) and severe (n = 30) groups according to the severity of canal stenosis. Patient characteristics and parameters were compared between the groups before and after surgery, including the visual analog scale (VAS) score for leg pain, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EA, and L/EA. In addition, factors affecting EA and L/EA were evaluated using multiple regression analysis.
RESULTS: Age (p = 0.031), preoperative EA (p < 0.001), preoperative L/EA (p = 0.032), and sagittal vertical axis (p = 0.033) were significantly different between groups. The VAS score and ODI significantly improved postoperatively in both groups (p < 0.001). The EA significantly improved postoperatively only in the severe group (p < 0.001), whereas the L/EA did not significantly improve in either group. Multiple regression analysis showed that only the severity of canal stenosis was significantly associated with preoperative EA (p = 0.030), whereas age (p = 0.040) and severity of canal stenosis (p = 0.030) were significantly associated with preoperative L/EA. Diabetes was significantly associated with postoperative EA (p = 0.046) and L/EA (p = 0.030).
CONCLUSION: The severity of canal stenosis affected abnormal postural sway, which improved after decompression surgery.
