Title: Infantile hydrocephalus: A retrospective cohort of 467 patients from a single center.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Infantile hydrocephalus has various etiologies that may influence children's cognitive development and onset of neurological comorbidities such as epilepsy. However, few studies specifically analyzed etiologies encountered in this population. Here we report a 9-year retrospective analysis of the etiologies and short-term outcome of surgically treated patients in a major pediatric neurosurgical center in a high-income country.
METHODS: This was a single-center retrospective study for the period 2010 to 2018 using the database of the French medical classification for clinical procedures (CCAM) of the Necker Hospital, Paris. We included all the patients surgically treated for hydrocephalus before the age of 2 years and reviewed digital medical files and MRI.
RESULTS: Four hundred and sixty seven patients were included, with a mean age at diagnosis of 4.8 months and male predominance (M/F ratio=1/2). Etiologies comprised: intraventricular hemorrhage (27.8%), arachnoid cyst (13.9%), spinal dysraphism (12.4%), brain tumor (10.5%), associated brain malformation (8.6%), infection (7.5%), isolated aqueduct stenosis (5.1%), and other (14.1%). Epilepsy was more likely to occur in post-infection (40%) and post-hemorrhage (31%) hydrocephalus, and when brain malformation was associated (35%). Etiology, epileptic status and the number of dysfunctions influenced short-term school performance.
CONCLUSION: This study identified various etiologies of infantile hydrocephalus, with different neurological outcomes. Specific follow-up is required according to these observations.
