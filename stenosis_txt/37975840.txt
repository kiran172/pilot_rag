Title: Treatment with adult glottic stenosis using CO<sub>2</sub> laser surgery combined with self-made laryngeal dilator.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIMS/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the treatment for adult glottic stenosis using CO<sub>2</sub> laser surgery combined with a self-made laryngeal dilator.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on 18 patients with glottic stenosis who were treated using CO<sub>2</sub> laser surgery combined with a self-made laryngeal dilator in our hospital from January 2018 to December 2020.
RESULTS: 4 cases were caused by trauma and one by laryngophthisis. Laryngeal stenosis occurred in 4 and 9 patients respectively after CO<sub>2</sub> laser surgery and open partial laryngectomy. Of them, one patient underwent postoperative radiotherapy. All patients were treated through CO<sub>2</sub> laser surgery combined with a self-made laryngeal dilator under general anesthesia. 3-6â€‰months later, the dilator was removed. Inflammation, ulceration and granulation were observed surrounding the dilator. But these complications would be cured and respiration was not affected. Finally, four patients could not be extubated and the decannulation rate achieved 78%. All patients successfully decannulated could normally intake. 13 cases had good voice quality and only one patient pronounced hoarsely.
CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: It is demonstrated that the application of CO<sub>2</sub> laser surgery combined with a laryngeal self-made dilator is feasible and effective for the treatment with adult glottic stenosis.
