Title: Simulation of thrombosis in a stenotic microchannel: The effects of vWF-enhanced shear activation of platelets.

Abstract: This study was undertaken to develop a numerical/computational simulation of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) - mediated platelet shear activation and deposition in an idealized stenosis. Blood is treated as a multi-constituent mixture comprised of a linear fluid component and a porous solid component (thrombus). Chemical and biological species involved in coagulation are modeled using a system of coupled convection-reaction-diffusion (CRD) equations. This study considers the cumulative effect of shear stress (history) on platelet activation. The vWF activity is modeled as an enhancement function for the shear stress accumulation and is related to the experimentally-observed unfolding rate of vWF. A series of simulations were performed in an idealized stenosis in which the predicted platelets deposition agreed well with previous experimental observations spatially and temporally, including the reduction of platelet deposition with decreasing expansion angle. Further simulation indicated a direct relationship between vWF-mediated platelet deposition and degree of stenosis. Based on the success with these benchmark simulations, it is hoped that the model presented here may provide additional insight into vWF-mediated thrombosis and prove useful for the development of more hemo-compatible blood-wetted devices in the future.
