Title: Neck dissection for head and neck malignancies with concurrent carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: Head and neck malignancies share similar risk factors as carotid artery stenosis and these can often present together. Patients who require external beam radiotherapy are at a higher risk of developing significant worsening stenosis. The workup of the oncologic patient often includes computed tomography, which can reveal underlying carotid artery stenosis, offering an opportunity to address both conditions in one operation and prevent the need for a complicated carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in irradiated and previously operated tissue. It was postulated that these two operations can be combined safely. The surgical protocol, surgical technique, and outcomes of a case series of four patients with head and neck cancer who underwent neck dissection and CEA for carotid artery stenosis during the same operation is presented. CEA was performed safely, simultaneously with neck dissection. CEA did not affect the surgical outcomes or postoperative course of the patients, and no minor or major complications were observed related to this procedure. Carotid endarterectomy performed by a vascular surgeon can be safely combined with oncologic neck dissection in the same procedure to avoid future complications in head and neck cancer patients.
