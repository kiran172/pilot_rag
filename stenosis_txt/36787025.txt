Title: Aortic Stenosis: Risk Stratification and Timing of Surgery.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarizes the current management of patients with newly diagnosed aortic stenosis.
RECENT FINDINGS: Recent developments include detection of early myocardial dysfunction using serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels and global longitudinal strain, as well as ongoing trials of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in asymptomatic patients and patients with moderate aortic stenosis complicated by symptoms or left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Given the high mortality associated with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis, all symptomatic patients should be referred for aortic valve replacement. Asymptomatic patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction, abnormal exercise stress test, high degree of stenosis, rapid disease progression, or elevated serum B-type natriuretic peptide level may also have an indication for valve replacement, based on established criteria. The progress in management of severe aortic stenosis has been in the direction of earlier detection and earlier valve replacement.
