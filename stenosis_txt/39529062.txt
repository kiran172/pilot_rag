Title: Long-term results of intensive care patients with post-intubation tracheal stenosis: 7 years follow-up.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: Benign tracheal stenosis (TS) is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by iatrogenic events resulting from endotracheal intubation and tracheostomy. The study aimed to determine the clinical characteristics, management, and long-term outcomes of patients with simple or complex post-intubation tracheal stenosis (PITS) who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the ICU between June 2016 and June 2022 and diagnosed with PITS were performed until June 2023.
RESULTS: 76 patients (mean age 54.9 ± 17.3%, 63.2% male, 61.8% complex stenosis) admitted to the ICU were analysed. The diagnosis of PITS was made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FOB) in 53.9% and computed tomography (CT) in 46.1%. The most common location of stenosis was the upper trachea area (57.9%, n = 44). The median stenosis length of the TS was 1.9 cm (median 2 cm for complex stenosis, 1 cm for simple stenosis, p < 0.001). Complex stenosis was associated with longer intubation time and multiple intubation history (p = 0.011, p = 0.028). At the same; complex stenosis was associated with prolonged and high stenosis percentage (p < 0.001). While dilatation and cryotherapy were sufficient for treatment in all patients with simple stenosis, the stent was applied to 34% patients with complex stenosis. Recurrence was higher in complex stenosis after bronchoscopic procedure (complex stenosis 95.7%, simple stenosis 17.2%). 19 (25%) patients required surgical operation, and all of these patients had complex stenosis (p < 0.001). Median follow-up was 33 months for simple stenosis and 34 months for complex stenosis. ICU length of stay (LOS) was longer in patients with complex stenosis. There was no statistically significant difference between TS classes in terms of ICU mortality (p = 0.466), 1-year mortality (p = 0.951), and mortality during follow-up (p = 0.608).
CONCLUSION: PITS is a challenging situation in ICU patients. In patients with a preliminary diagnosis of PITS, bronchoscopy should be performed without delay, and it should be known that interventional bronchoscopy is not only a diagnostic tool but an effective strategy in treatment management after the diagnosis is finalised. The advantage of interventional bronchoscopy is that it alleviates symptoms that necessitate hospitalisation in the ICU and eliminates the need for ICU of patients.
