Title: Safety and feasibility of early discharge after transcatheter aortic valve implantation with ACURATE Neo-the POLESTAR trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) serves a growing range of patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS). TAVI has evolved to a streamlined procedure minimizing length of hospital stay.
AIMS: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of an early discharge (ED) strategy after TAVI.
METHODS: We performed an international, multi-center, prospective observational single-arm study in AS patients undergoing TAVI with the ACURATE valve platform. Eligibility for ED was assessed prior to TAVI and based on prespecified selection criteria. Discharge ≤ 48 h was defined as ED. Primary Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-3-defined 30-day safety and efficacy composite endpoints were landmarked at 48 h and compared between ED and non-ED groups.
RESULTS: A total of 252 patients were included. The median age was 82 [25th-75th percentile, 78-85] years and the median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality (STS-PROM) score was 2.2% [25th-75th percentile, 1.6-3.3]. ED and non-ED were achieved in 173 (69%) and 79 (31%) patients respectively. Monitoring for conduction disturbances was the principal reason for non-ED (33%). Overall, at 30 days, all-cause mortality was 1%, new permanent pacemaker rate was 4%, and valve- or procedure-related rehospitalization was 4%. There was no difference in the primary safety and efficacy endpoint between the ED and non-ED cohorts (OR 0.84 [25th-75th percentile, 0.31-2.26], p = 0.73, and OR 0.97 [25th-75th percentile, 0.46-2.06], p = 0.94). The need for rehospitalization was similarly low for ED and non-ED groups.
CONCLUSION: Early discharge after TAVI with the ACURATE valve is safe and feasible in selected patients. Rhythm monitoring and extended clinical observation protracted hospital stay.
