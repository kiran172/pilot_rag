Title: Neutrophil extracellular trap burden correlates with the stenosis of coronary atherosclerosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary atherosclerosis diseases (CADs) are associated with chronic inflammation. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are a type of novel proinflammatory cytokines whose levels are dramatically elevated in acute coronary syndrome. We conducted this study to further evaluate the association between circulating NET-associated markers and CAD in Chinese adults.
METHODS: A total of 174 patients with CAD and 55 healthy controls were screened using percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary computed tomography angiography. Blood lipid levels, blood glucose levels, and blood cell counts were determined using commercial kits. Serum levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and neutrophil elastase (NE) were measured using ELISA. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) in serum was quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen assay. We also compared the circulating NET levels with various parameters in the study subjects.
RESULTS: The levels of serum NET markers, dsDNA, MPO, and NE, were significantly elevated in patients with CAD, particularly in the severe group, consistent with the increase in neutrophil counts. The levels of NET markers correlated with the risk factors of AS, increasing with the number of risk factors. NET markers were identified as independent risk factors for severe coronary stenosis and also as predictors of severe CAD.
CONCLUSION: NETs may be related to AS and serve as indicators or predictors of stenosis in patients with severe CAD.
