Title: Independent predictors of loss of primary patency at 1 year after aortoiliac stent implantation.

Abstract: To identify the risk factors for restenosis at 1 year after aortoiliac stenting for symptomatic peripheral artery disease in real-world practice. We performed subgroup analysis of a large-scale prospective multicenter registry study enrolling Japanese patients with peripheral arterial disease who underwent aortoiliac endovascular therapy from April 2014 to April 2016. The subgroup comprised 880 patients (1108 limbs) who received iliac stenting. The Rutherford class was 2, 3, and 4 in 42%, 51%, and 7% of the patients, respectively. TASC II class D disease was noted in 18% of the patients and 35% had chronic total occlusion. Mean total stent length was 82.1 ± 48.5 mm and minimum stent diameter was 9.0 ± 1.3 mm. Balloon-expandable stents were used in 8% of the limbs. Concomitant femoropopliteal lesions were present in 36% of the limbs with aortoiliac lesions. In the overall patient population, the risk of restenosis at 1 year after stenting was 11.4%. Femoropopliteal lesions and the minimum stent diameter were identified as independent risk factors for restenosis at 1 year. When the study population was stratified according to these two risk factors, the restenosis rate at 1 year was 27.1% in the patients with a minimum stent diameter < 8 mm and femoropopliteal lesions, whereas it was only 5.3% in those with a minimum stent diameter ≥ 10 mm and no femoropopliteal lesions. Femoropopliteal lesions and a smaller stent diameter were independent risk factors for restenosis at 1 year after aortoiliac stenting.
