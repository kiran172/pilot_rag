Title: Percutaneous Biliary Interventions: Clinical Indications, Comparative Effectiveness, Technical Considerations, Complications, and Outcomes.

Abstract: Percutaneous biliary interventions (PBIs) are commonly performed by interventional radiologists for a variety of clinical indications including biliary infections, strictures, leaks, and postoperative complications. PBIs have high technical and clinical success rates and are relatively safe when compared with more invasive surgical techniques. Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography and percutaneous biliary drainage play an essential role in the management of common posthepatobiliary complications including biliary strictures and leaks. Percutaneous biliary endoscopy can be used for direct visualization of the biliary tree and a variety of interventions including tissue biopsy, lithotripsy, stone removal, as well as stent placement and removal.
