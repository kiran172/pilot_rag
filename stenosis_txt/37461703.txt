Title: Polygenic Risk Score Associates with Atherosclerotic Plaque Characteristics at Autopsy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for coronary artery disease (CAD) potentially improve cardiovascular risk prediction. However, their relationship with histopathologic features of CAD has never been examined systematically.
METHODS: From 4,327 subjects referred to CVPath by the State of Maryland Office Chief Medical Examiner (OCME) for sudden death between 1994 and 2015, 2,455 cases were randomly selected for genotyping. We generated PRS from 291 known CAD risk loci. Detailed histopathologic examination of the coronary arteries was performed in all subjects. The primary study outcome measurements were histopathologic plaque features determining severity of atherosclerosis, including %stenosis, calcification, thin-cap fibroatheromas (TCFA), and thrombotic CAD.
RESULTS: After exclusion of cases with insufficient DNA sample quality or with missing data, 954 cases (mean age 48.8±14.7; 75.7% men) remained in the final study cohort. Subjects in the highest PRS quintile exhibited more severe atherosclerosis compared to subjects in the lowest quintile, with greater %stenosis (80.3%±27.0% vs. 50.4%±38.7%; adjusted p<0.001) and a higher frequency of calcification (69.6% vs. 35.8%; adjusted p=0.004) and TCFAs (26.7% vs. 9.5%; adjusted p=0.007). Even after adjustment for traditional CAD risk factors subjects within the highest PRS quintile had higher odds of severe atherosclerosis (i.e., ≥75% stenosis; adjusted OR 3.77; 95%CI 2.10-6.78; p<0.001) and plaque rupture (adjusted OR 4.05; 95%CI 2.26-7.24; p<0.001). Moreover, subjects within the highest quintile had higher odds of CAD-associated cause of death, especially among those aged 50 years and younger (adjusted OR 4.08; 95%CI 2.01-8.30; p<0.001). No associations were observed with plaque erosion.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first autopsy study investigating associations between PRS and atherosclerosis severity at the histopathologic level in subjects with sudden death. Our pathological analysis suggests PRS correlates with plaque burden and features of advanced atherosclerosis and may be useful as a method for CAD risk stratification, especially in younger subjects.
HIGHLIGHTS: In this autopsy study including 954 subjects within the CVPath Sudden Death Registry, high PRS correlated with plaque burden and atherosclerosis severity.The PRS showed differential associations with plaque rupture and plaque erosion, suggesting different etiologies to these two causes of thrombotic CAD.PRS may be useful for risk stratification, particularly in the young. Further examination of individual risk loci and their association with plaque morphology may help understand molecular mechanisms of atherosclerosis, potentially revealing new therapy targets of CAD.
GRAPHIC ABSTRACT: A polygenic risk score, generated from 291 known CAD risk loci, was assessed in 954 subjects within the CVPath Sudden Death Registry. Histopathologic examination of the coronary arteries was performed in all subjects. Subjects in the highest PRS quintile exhibited more severe atherosclerosis as compared to subjects in the lowest quintile, with a greater plaque burden, more calcification, and a higher frequency of plaque rupture.
