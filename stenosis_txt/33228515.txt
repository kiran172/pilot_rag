Title: [Possibilities of Stress Computed Tomography Myocardial Perfusion Imaging in the Diagnosis of Ischemic Heart Disease].

Abstract: Computed tomography angiography (CT-angiography, CTA) allows noninvasive visualization of coronary arteries (CA). This method is highly sensitive in detecting coronary atherosclerosis. However, standard CTA does not allow evaluation of the hemodynamic significance of found CA stenoses, which requires additional functional tests for detection of myocardial ischemia. This review focuses on possibilities of clinical use, limitations, technical aspects, and prospects of a combination of CT-angiography and CT myocardial perfusion imaging in diagnostics of ischemic heart disease.
