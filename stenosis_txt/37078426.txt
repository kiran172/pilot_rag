Title: Novel technique for high-risk coronary protection during implantation of transcatheter aortic valve implants.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become increasingly common as the indications expanded to include valve-in-valve (ViV) applications and a wider patient population with lower surgical risk. Intra-operative coronary arterial occlusion remains a significant source of morbidity, particularly in ViV applications or cases with high-risk anatomy. We present a novel technique for coronary artery protection utilizing a guide extension catheter to secure coronary access during valve deployment and a ViV case demonstration in a patient with prior surgical aortic valve replacement.
