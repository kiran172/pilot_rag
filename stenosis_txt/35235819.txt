Title: Management of Cardiac Symptoms in Amyloidosis.

Abstract: Cardiac amyloidosis (CA) results in symptoms of heart failure, atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, conduction disturbances, and profound autonomic dysfunction. These symptoms present unique management challenges as compared with patients without CA, and can be very debilitating. Thus, management of the cardiovascular symptoms of these patients plays a central role in their care. This review presents an overview of the typical cardiovascular manifestations encountered in patients with CA and highlights the key management considerations for each.
