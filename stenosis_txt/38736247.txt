Title: Transfemoral-only transcatheter aortic valve replacement: A single center experience of 400 consecutive patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), transfemoral (TF) access offers several advantages over alternative access routes. Advances in sheaths and valve delivery technology have catalyzed the feasibility of TF-TAVR, even in challenging anatomies.
AIMS: Report procedural characteristics and outcomes of a TAVR program aiming for a 100% TF access rate.
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing TAVR were enrolled in a prospective registry. Equipment used to facilitate TF-access in challenging anatomies included low-profile sheaths, dilatators, peripheral balloons, covered and uncovered self-expanding and balloon-expandable stents, and intravascular lithotripsy (IVL).
RESULTS: A total of 400 patients with a mean age of 81 ± 6 years (42% female) were analyzed. Minimal iliofemoral artery diameter (MLD) of the main access side was <5 mm in 42 (10.5%), extreme tortuosity was present in 65 (16.3%), and severe calcification in 59 (14.8%). TF-access was successful in 399 (99.8%) patients. A transaxillary access was used in one patient. In multivariable analysis, an MLD < 5 mm was the strongest predictor for vascular complications (11.9% vs. 3.9%, OR: 3.86, 95% CI: 1.38-10.8, p = 0.01). Such patients also had more major/life-threatening bleeding (14.2% vs. 3.1%, p < 0.001) and required more planned and unplanned peripheral interventions to enable TF access (35.8% vs. 3.4%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that utilization of dedicated sheaths, peripheral balloons, stents, and IVL enables TAVR via TF access in >99% of patients. However, rates of vascular and bleeding complications in patients with narrow iliofemoral arteries (MLD < 5 mm) were high.
