Title: Echocardiographic Global Longitudinal Strain Is Associated With Myocardial Fibrosis and Predicts Outcomes in Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Aims: Left ventricular ejection fraction is the conventional measure used to guide heart failure management, regardless of underlying etiology. Left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LV-GLS) by speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) is a more sensitive measure of intrinsic myocardial function. We aim to establish LV-GLS as a marker of replacement myocardial fibrosis on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and validate the prognostic value of LV-GLS thresholds associated with fibrosis. Methods and results: LV-GLS thresholds of replacement fibrosis were established in the derivation cohort: 151 patients (57 ± 10 years; 58% males) with hypertension who underwent STE to measure LV-GLS and CMR. Prognostic value of the thresholds was validated in a separate outcome cohort: 261 patients with moderate-severe aortic stenosis (AS; 71 ± 12 years; 58% males; NYHA functional class I-II) and preserved LVEF ≥50%. Primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular mortality, heart failure hospitalization, and myocardial infarction. In the derivation cohort, LV-GLS demonstrated good discrimination (c-statistics 0.74 [0.66-0.83]; P &lt; 0.001) and calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow χ2 = 6.37; P = 0.605) for replacement fibrosis. In the outcome cohort, 47 events occurred over 16 [3.3, 42.2] months. Patients with LV-GLS &gt; -15.0% (corresponding to 95% specificity to rule-in myocardial fibrosis) had the worst outcomes compared to patients with LV-GLS &lt; -21.0% (corresponding to 95% sensitivity to rule-out myocardial fibrosis) and those between -21.0 and -15.0% (log-rank P &lt; 0.001). LV-GLS offered independent prognostic value over clinical variables, AS severity and echocardiographic LV mass and E/e'. Conclusion: LV-GLS thresholds associated with replacement myocardial fibrosis is a novel approach to risk-stratify patients with AS and preserved LVEF.
