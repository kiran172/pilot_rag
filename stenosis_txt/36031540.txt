Title: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement for Bicuspid Aortic Stenosis With a Severely Calcified Raphe Using An Under-Sized SAPIEN 3 Valve: Sizing by the Circle Method and Deployment by the Pressure-Regulated Method.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for bicuspid aortic valve stenosis is challenging, and the absence of established methods for sizing the bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) complicates TAVR. We report a case of successful TAVR for bicuspid aortic stenosis with a severely calcified raphe. We used an undersized SAPIEN 3 valve, with three safety measures based on assessment of structural characteristics, sizing by the circle method, and deployment of the valve by the pressure-regulated method.
