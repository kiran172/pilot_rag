Title: Comparison of modes of failure and clinical outcomes between explanted porcine and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare pathological and hemodynamic modes of failure and operative outcomes between explanted porcine and bovine pericardial bioprosthetic valves.
METHODS: Patients who underwent explantation of their bioprosthetic valves at Toronto General Hospital from 2007 to 2019 were identified. Retrospective chart review was conducted to attain demographic information, operative outcomes, and echocardiography and pathology reports.
RESULTS: A total of 278 patients underwent explantation of their porcine (n=183) or bovine pericardial (n=95) valves. A greater proportion of the porcine group had severe regurgitation, compared to the bovine group (45.3% vs. 19.8%, p<.001). Porcine valves had higher rates of cusp flail (19.4% vs. 3.3%, p<.001). The rates of moderate or worse stenosis were higher among bovine pericardial valves (37.9% vs. 15.8%, p<.001). On pathologic examination, the porcine valves exhibited more cusp tears (67.6% vs. 50.5%, p=.006), while higher incidences of calcification were found in the bovine group (p<.001). Rate of stroke was higher during the explantation procedure of the bovine valves (5.3% vs. 0.5%, p=.040).
CONCLUSIONS: The primary mode of failure was regurgitation in porcine valves due to cusp tears and stenosis in bovine valves due to calcification. Establishing a clear understanding of failure modes based on valve material may improve design and guide valve selection at the time of surgery.
