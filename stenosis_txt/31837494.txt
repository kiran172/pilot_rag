Title: Transient Cerebral Vasospasm After Carotid Artery Stenting: A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cerebral embolism after carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a well-known complication, but cerebral ischemia owing to cerebral vasospasm after CAS is rare and has seldom been reported. We describe a patient with transient ischemic complications owing to reversible cerebral vasospasm of the middle cerebral artery after CAS.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 74-year-old man presented with right hemiparesis caused by acutely scattered brain infarction in the left cerebral hemisphere. Magnetic resonance angiography showed severe stenosis of the left cervical internal carotid artery origin. CAS under a distal filter protection was performed without any intraprocedural complications, but 12 hours later, the patient had aphasia and Gerstmann syndrome. Urgent magnetic resonance imaging revealed no evidence of an intracranial hemorrhage or new cerebral infarction. However, magnetic resonance angiography showed diffuse vasospasm of the left middle cerebral artery. His symptoms and imaging findings improved gradually with conservative treatment. The patient was discharged without new neurologic deficit or recurrent attack 3 weeks after CAS.
CONCLUSIONS: In a patient with delayed neurologic symptoms after CAS, the possibility of cerebral vasospasm should be kept in mind to select appropriate treatment.
