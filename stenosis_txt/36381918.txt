Title: Unique Case of a Refractory Esophageal Peptic Stricture in an Uncontrolled Diabetic.

Abstract: Esophageal strictures can lead to the narrowing of the esophagus and dysphagia. They are termed peptic strictures when caused by acid reflux and usually measure less than two centimeters in the lower esophagus. Peptic strictures can be treated with proton pump inhibitors, endoscopic dilation, and esophagectomy. We present a unique case of a young diabetic who developed progressive dysphagia and was found to have a 5-centimeter esophageal peptic stricture refractory to treatment. His symptoms were secondary to gastroparesis and acid reflux from uncontrolled diabetes. Since diabetics are more likely to develop such complications, an important part of the management of peptic strictures should be focused on diabetes control.
