Title: Outcome of dorsal buccal graft urethroplasty in female urethral stricture disease (FUSD); our institutional experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Female urethral stricture is a poorly studied disease entity. To date, its management has been poorly evaluated, with small numbers and various definitions of success. Treatment options traditionally have been urethral dilatation and/or self-catheterization with success rates ranging from only 14 to 49%. However, there has been increasing use of urethroplasty due to the improved success rate (70 to 100%). In this study we assessed the outcome of dorsal buccal mucosal grafts in female urethral stricture disease.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In our study we prospectively analyzed 25 female patients treated from 2014 to 2019 at our institute; ages ranged from 26 to 66 years. Dorsal buccal mucosal graft urethroplasty was performed in all patients. The pathology of female urethral stricture disease is unknown, and neither the pre- nor the intraoperative assessment allows determining the precise location and extent or the severity of urethral damage; therefore, we advocate extensive grafting of the entire urethra. Patients were followed every 3 months during the 1st year and then biannually with lower urinary tract symptom, uroflowmetry and post-void residual urine assessments. Stricture recurrence (failure) was defined as recurrence of symptoms, no change or reversal in Q<sub>max</sub> and post-void residual urine values and failure of negotiation of a 17-Fr cystoscope.
RESULTS: Success rate of our surgical intervention was > 90%. We observed that the mid-urethra was the most common location of the stricture. Stricture location was confined to the distal urethra in 12%, the mid-urethra in 16%, spanned the distal mid-urethra in 16%, spanned the mid-proximal urethra in 40% and spanned the pan-urethra in 16%. Mean stricture length was 1.8 (0.7-2.1) cm. Mean pre- versus postoperative Qmax was 5 ml/s versus 23.3 ml/s and mean residual urine was 178 ml versus 18.5 ml. Two patients had stricture recurrence at 3 months post-intervention.
CONCLUSION: Dorsal buccal mucosal graft currently represents a prime choice for female urethral stricture reconstruction, keeping in view the advantages of the procedure such as easy availability of the graft and fewer donor site comorbidities. We emphasize upfront urethroplasty and extensive urethral grafting.
