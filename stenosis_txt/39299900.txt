Title: Non-invasive imaging innovation: FFR-CT combined with plaque characterization, safeguarding your cardiac health.

Abstract: Studies have shown that high-risk plaque features (including thin fibrous caps, lipid-rich cores, large plaque volumes, and intraplaque microcalcifications) are closely associated with the occurrence of acute coronary events. CT-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) is a non-invasive imaging post-processing technique that utilizes artificial intelligence to analyze data obtained from conventional coronary CT angiography (CCTA). FFR-CT technology offers the hemodynamic assessment of coronary lesions, aiding in the prediction of potential cardiovascular risks. This review summarizes the latest research progress on the complex relationship between FFR-CT, plaque characteristics, and hemodynamics, closely linking plaque volume, composition, and distribution with the clinical significance of coronary artery stenosis. It is hoped that these research findings will provide valuable guidance for clinicians, promoting the application of CT in the non-invasive detection of vulnerable plaques, thereby more effectively preventing and managing coronary artery disease. In the future, further optimization of FFR-CT technology and expansion of its clinical application are expected to significantly reduce the incidence and mortality of coronary artery disease, offering new hope for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases.
