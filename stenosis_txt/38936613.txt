Title: Percutaneous Kyphoplasty via Transverse Process-Rib-Pedicle Approach for Upper and Middle Thoracic Osteoporosis Fracture with Pedicle Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical effect of percutaneous kyphoplasty (PKP) via process-rib-pedicle approach for upper and middle thoracic osteoporosis fractures with pedicle stenosis.
METHODS: This study is a retrospective observational study. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the data of 62 patients with upper thoracic vertebral bone loss compression fracture treated via the process-rib-pedicle pathway PKP at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University from January 2020 to December 2022. The patients were divided into group A (unilateral PKP, 38 cases) and group B (bilateral PKP, 24 cases). The aspects of surgical safety, clinical efficacy, and radiological outcome were investigated.
RESULTS: All 62 patients successfully completed the surgery without any spinal cord, nerve, or vascular injury, and there were no complications such as infection and vascular embolism. The differences in visual analog scale scores（P < 0.05）, Oswestry disability index functional index（P < 0.05）, and Cobb angle（P < 0.05） were significant when comparing preoperative and postoperative periods, and the differences were not significant when comparing the postoperative periods (P > 0.05). There were no statistically significant differences in days of hospital stay (P = 0.653) and the rate of bone cement leakage (P = 0.537) between the 2 groups.
CONCLUSIONS: For upper middle osteoporotic thoracic vertebral fractures with pedicle stenosis, puncture via the process-rib-pedicle path is a safe and reliable puncture route, and more than 2.5 ml of cement can achieve good clinical outcomes, regardless of bilateral or unilateral PKP.
