Title: Malakoplakia of the bladder near the ureteral orifice: a case report.

Abstract: Malakoplakia, a rare acquired granulomatous disease, affects many systems, including the urogenital tract. The literature describes malakoplakia of different viscera, and satisfactory results have been obtained after treatment. We reported a 48-year-old patient with diabetes who received multiple treatments in our hospital for bladder malakoplakia near the ureteral orifice. Despite aggressive treatment, the patient had recurrent bladder malakoplakia and even developed right ureteral orifice stenosis, which resulted in urinary obstruction and hydronephrosis. We believe that malakoplakia in the bladder near ureteral orifice should receive more attention. Satisfactory results may not be obtained through antibiotic treatment alone, and early antibiotic therapy combined with full surgical excision may be a better choice.
