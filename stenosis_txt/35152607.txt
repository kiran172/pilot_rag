Title: [Transcheter aortic valve implantation as a method of treatment of chronic heart failure in elderly and old patients: Literature review (part 1).].

Abstract: Aortic valve (AV) stenosis is the most common acquired valvular disease with an increasing prevalence due to an aging population, requiring surgical or endovascular intervention. Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) represents a real revolution in the field of interventional cardiology for the treatment of elderly or high-risk patients with severe symptomatic AV stenosis. TAVI allows for the correction of aortic defect in the most severe group of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) with severe comorbidity, who are contraindicated for open surgery to replace AV, in order to interrupt the vicious circle in the progression of CHF, stimulate reverse myocardial remodeling, alleviate symptoms, improve the quality of life, and prognosis of patients, and also as a «bridge» to heart transplantation. With the development of next-generation devices, TAVI has evolved from a complex and dangerous procedure to an effective and safe technique. Currently, the greatest scientific interest is the study of valve durability and the possibility of expanding the indications for performing TAVI in categories of patients with low surgical risk, as well as in younger age groups.
