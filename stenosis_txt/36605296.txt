Title: Does Cardiac Contractility Modulation Therapy Reduce Atrial Fibrillation Burden?

Abstract: Cardiac contractility modulation (CCM) is an implantable technology approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and intended for heart failure patients without a cardiac resynchronization therapy indication. CCM leads to reduced heart failure hospitalizations and improvements in exercise tolerance and quality of life. There are a lack of data examining the impact of CCM therapy on atrial fibrillation (AF) burden. We report the case of a 65-year-old man with a history of paroxysmal AF, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and carotid artery stenosis who presented with newly diagnosed ischemic cardiomyopathy with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 20%-25%. He underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery for triple vessel disease with an improvement in LVEF to 40% after 4 months of guideline-directed medical therapy. Due to clinical heart failure and paroxysms of AF, he underwent CCM device and implantable loop recorder (ILR) implantation. His LVEF improved to 60%, and the ILR showed no AF. We postulate multiple mechanisms to explain the negligible burden of AF.
