Title: Clinical Characteristics and Management of Peripancreatic Arterial Aneurysms: A 20-year Experience.

Abstract: Pancreaticoduodenal and gastroduodenal artery aneurysms (PDAAs and GDAAs) are rare visceral aneurysms. Considering the rupture risk regardless of size, treatment should be provided promptly. We reviewed the characteristics and management of peripancreatic aneurysms in a retrospective, single-center review of consecutive patients with PDAAs and GDAAs between 2000 and 2022. Demographics, clinical characteristics, radiologic features, treatment, and outcomes were recorded. Nineteen PDAAs and seven GDAAs were identified in 24 patients. The median sizes of the PDAAs and GDAAs were 21 mm (range: 8-50 mm) and 14 mm (range: 11-32 mm), respectively. There were 4 ruptured cases (15.4%). Ten aneurysms (38.5%) had concomitant visceral aneurysms, and 16 (61.6%) were associated with celiac pathology. Aneurysms were managed using endovascular in 12 (46.2%), surgical in 4 (15.4%), and combined methods in 3 (11.5%) cases; 7 patients (26.9%) were lost to follow-up or refused treatments. During a median 13.8-month follow-up (range: 1-147.6), two complications (7.7%) occurred including pancreatitis and coil migration into the superior mesenteric artery after embolization within 30 days. After 30 days, aorto-common hepatic artery bypass graft stenosis was identified in one PDAA. Depending on the characteristics of peripancreatic aneurysms, endovascular, surgical, and hybrid approaches might all be practical treatment options.
