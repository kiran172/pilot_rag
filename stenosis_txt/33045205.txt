Title: Senning With Aortic Translocation and Anatomic Repair for Congenitally Corrected Transposition.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Anatomic repair for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonic stenosis has been accomplished with atrial switch and Rastelli. Aortic translocation offers a direct left ventricular outflow without an extraanatomic right ventricular-to-pulmonary conduit, which may lead to decreased reoperations. We reviewed our entire experience performing Senning with aortic translocation (SAT).
METHODS: From 2007 to 2017, 8 patients (mean age, 14.1 months; size, 8.86 kg) underwent SAT. Associated anomalies included situs inversus (n = 2), dextrocardia (n = 6), multiple muscular VSDs (n = 2), abnormal or straddling atrioventricular valve chords (n = 5), and branch pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 3). Four of 8 had previous systemic arterial shunts. Mean cardiopulmonary bypass was 487 minutes, and mean cardiac ischemic time was 307 minutes. Additional procedures included repair of branch pulmonary artery stenoses and closure of multiple muscular VSDs.
RESULTS: There was no hospital death. One patient was supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation because of junctional tachycardia on postoperative day 5. One patient required pacemaker placement for first-degree heart block. Median hospital length of stay was 31 days. Mean length of follow-up was 52 months. All patients remain well with mild or no aortic regurgitation. The first patient underwent a repeat surgical operation for pulmonary venous baffle obstruction 2 years after SAT.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite the technical complexity, patient outcomes have been satisfactory. We believe SAT provides a superior anatomic repair in these complex defects. Longer-term follow-up is needed regarding late intervention.
