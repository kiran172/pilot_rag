Title: Pathological evaluation of a fluoropolymer-based drug-eluting stent in an arteriovenous graft outflow venous stenosis.

Abstract: A fluoropolymer-based drug-eluting stent was implanted in an arteriovenous graft outflow venous stenosis. Two and a half years later, due to a local infection, the stent was removed surgically, and a pathological evaluation was conducted. The stent struts exhibited partial endothelial cell coverage, with the remaining surface predominantly covered by fibrin. Notably, there was no evidence of restenosis or aneurysmal change.
