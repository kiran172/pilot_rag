Title: Effects of hemodialysis and reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate in nonhemodialysis on clinical outcomes after fractional flow reserve-guided deferral of revascularization.

Abstract: The effect of renal dysfunction on clinical outcomes following fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided deferral of revascularization remains unelucidated.We retrospectively analyzed 224 patients with atherosclerotic coronary lesions who underwent deferred revascularization based on an FFR of >0.80. The median follow-up interval was 28.1 months. Patients were divided into 2 groups: the hemodialysis (HD) and the non-HD group. The non-HD group was further classified into 2 subgroups according to their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) level: eGFR <45, equivalent to chronic kidney disease stage 3b-5 and eGFR ≥45. We evaluated major adverse cardiac events (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and any revascularization.MACE occurred in 36 patients (16.1%). The rate of HD was significantly higher in the MACE group (19% vs 6%, P < .01). In non-HD patients, the eGFR was significantly lower in the MACE group (51.2 vs 63.2 mL/min/1.73 m2, P < .01). Overall, univariate Cox regression analysis revealed a significant relationship between HD and MACE (HR 2.91, P = .01), as did the multivariate model (HR 2.90, P = .01). Of the MACE, more deaths occurred in HD patients (15.8% vs 2.9%, P = .03). Among non-HD patients, eGFR <45 (HR 2.70, P = .02), FFR (per 0.01, HR 0.87, P < .01), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (per 10 mg/dL, HR 1.17, P = .02) were independent predictors of MACE. Any revascularization was more common in patients with eGFR<45 than in those with eGFR ≥45 (21.4% vs 7.3%, P = .02). Kaplan-Meier estimates revealed that the HD group showed a significantly lower MACE-free survival rate than the nonHD group (log-rank P < .01). In non-HD patients, the eGFR<45 group showed a lower MACE-free survival rate than the eGFR ≥45 group (log-rank P = .01).HD and reduced eGFR in non-HD patients were associated with adverse cardiac events after FFR-guided deferral of revascularization.
