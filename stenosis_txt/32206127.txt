Title: Basal and Acetazolamide Brain Perfusion SPECT in Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis including Moyamoya disease needs revascularization when hemodynamic insufficiency is validated. Vascular reserve impairment was the key to find the indication for endarterectomy/bypass surgery in the atherosclerotic ICA stenosis and to determine the indication, treatment effect, and prognosis in Moyamoya diseases. Vascular reserve was quantitatively assessed by 1-day split-dose I-123 IMP basal/acetazolamide SPECT in Japan or by Tc-99m HMPAO SPECT in other countries using qualitative or semi-quantitative method. We summarized the development of 1-day basal/ acetazolamide brain perfusion SPECT for ICA stenosis, both quantitative and qualitative methods, and their methodological issues regarding (1) acquisition protocol; (2) qualitative assessment, either visual or deep learning-based; (3) clinical use for atherosclerotic ICA steno-occlusive diseases and mostly Moyamoya diseases; and (4) their impact on the choice of treatment options. Trials to use CT perfusion or perfusion MRI using contrast materials or arterial spin labeling were briefly discussed in their endeavor to use basal studies alone to replace acetazolamide-challenge SPECT. Theoretical and practical issues imply that basal perfusion evaluation, no matter how much sophisticated, will not disclose vascular reserve. Acetazolamide rarely causes serious adverse reactions but included fatality, and now, we need to monitor patients closely in acetazolamide-challenge studies.
