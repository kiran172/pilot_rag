Title: Double-Valve Replacement in Patients With Mitral Annular Calcification and Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: Mitral annular calcification (MAC) is a degenerative process of the fibrous structure of the mitral valve. Surgical mitral valve replacement in the presence of MAC is technically challenging because of a high calcium burden and is associated with prohibitive operative mortality. There is no standard management strategy for patients with severe aortic stenosis and severe mitral valve disease with MAC. We report a case series of 3 patients who underwent concomitant surgical, transatrial implantation of a transcatheter heart valve in the mitral position and transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
