Title: [The association of cholesterol crystals and non-culprit plaque characteristics in AMI patients: an OCT study].

Abstract: Objective: To analyze plaque characteristics of non-culprit coronary lesions with cholesterol crystals in patients with acute myocardial infarction(AMI) by using optical coherence tomography(OCT). We also investigated the potential association between cholesterol crystals with plaque rupture and healed plaque at non-culprit segment. Methods: This study was a retrospective cohort study. Between January 2017 and December 2017, patients with AMI who underwent 3-vessel OCT imaging were included in this study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of cholesterol crystals at the non-culprit lesions. All patients underwent coronary angiography and OCT examination, and non-culprit plaque characteristics were compared between the two groups. The generalized estimating equation log-binomial multirariate regression model was used to assess the relationship between non-culprit lesions with cholesterol crystals and plaque rupture and plaque healing. The follow-up data collection ended in October 2023. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were plotted, and log-rank tests were used to compare the cumulative incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events between the two groups. Results: A total of 173 AMI patients were included (aged (56.8Â±11.6) years; 124 men (71.7%)). Among 710 non-culprit lesions identified by OCT, there were 102 (14.4%) in cholesterol crystals group and 608 (85.6%) in non-cholesterol crystals group. Compared with non-culprit lesions without cholesterol crystals, those with cholesterol crystals had smaller minimum lumen diameter, severer diameter stenosis, and longer lesion length (all P&lt;0.01). The prevalence of plaque rupture (17.6% (18/102) vs. 4.9% (30/608), P=0.001) and thin-cap fibroatheroma (31.4% (32/102) vs. 11.5% (70/608), P&lt;0.01) was higher in the cholesterol crystals groups than in the non-cholesterol crystals group. In addition, vulnerable plaque characteristics such as (44.1% (45/102) vs. 25.8% (157/608), P&lt;0.01), macrophages were more frequently observed in non-culprit lesions with cholesterol crystals. The generalized estimating equation log-binomial multivariate regression analyses showed that non-culprit cholesterol crystals were positively correlated with healed plaque (OR=1.583, 95%CI: 1.004-2.495, P=0.048). Conversely, cholesterol crystals were not associated with plaque rupture (OR=1.632, 95%CI: 0.745-3.576, P=0.221). The follow-up time was 2 142 (1 880, 2 198) days. Non-culprit cholesterol crystals were not related to the major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with AMI (log-rank P=0.558). Conclusions: Among AMI patients, non-culprit lesions with cholesterol crystals presented with severer luminal stenosis and increased plaque vulnerability. The presence of non-culprit cholesterol crystals was associated with rather than plaque rupture.
