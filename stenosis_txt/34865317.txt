Title: Automating fractional flow reserve (FFR) calculation from CT scans: A rapid workflow using unsupervised learning and computational fluid dynamics.

Abstract: Fractional flow reserve (FFR) provides the functional relevance of coronary atheroma. The FFR-guided strategy has been shown to reduce unnecessary stenting, improve overall health outcome, and to be cost-saving. The non-invasive, coronary computerised tomography (CT) angiography-derived FFR (cFFR) is an emerging method in reducing invasive catheter based measurements. This computational fluid dynamics-based method is laborious as it requires expertise in multidisciplinary analysis of combining image analysis and computational mechanics. In this work, we present a rapid method, powered by unsupervised learning, to automatically calculate cFFR from CT scans without manual intervention.
