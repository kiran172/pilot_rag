Title: Association of epicardial adipose tissue volume with increased risk of hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) is closely related to coronary artery disease (CAD). Hemodynamically significant CAD has a worse prognosis and is more likely to benefit from revascularization. However, the specific relationship between EAT and hemodynamically significant CAD remains unclear.
METHODS: A total of 164 inpatients received single-photon emission computerized tomography-myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT/MPI) and coronary angiography (CAG) between March 2018 and October 2019 at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University were enrolled in the retrospective cross-sectional study. Data on body mass index (BMI), hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus (DM), active smoking, and symptoms were gathered. Epicardial fat volume (EFV) and coronary artery calcium (CAC) were quantified by noncontrast computed tomography (CT). Hemodynamically significant CAD was defined by coronary stenosis severity ≥50% with reversible perfusion defects in the corresponding areas of SPECT/MPI.
RESULTS: A total of 37.8% of patients had hemodynamically significant CAD. Age and BMI increased with tertiles of EFV (P for trend =0.009 and P&lt;0.001). The ratios of hemodynamically significant CAD in EFV from low to high were 16.4%, 37.0%, and 60.0%, respectively (P for the trend &lt;0.001). In univariate regression analysis, EFV was associated with hemodynamically significant CAD [odds ratio (OR) per 10 cm3 =1.36; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20-1.55; P&lt;0.001]. After correcting for traditional risk factors and CAC, EFV was firmly linked to hemodynamically significant CAD (OR per 10 cm3 =1.53; 95% CI: 1.25-1.88; P&lt;0.001). With an increasing trend in EFV for the tripartite groups, the likelihood of hemodynamically significant CAD increased significantly (P for trend &lt;0.001). There was a saturation effect between EFV and hemodynamically significant CAD according to the generalized additive model (GAM). When EFV &lt;134.43 cm3, EFV was linearly correlated with hemodynamically significant CAD (OR per 10 cm3 =2.06; 95% CI: 1.45-2.94; P&lt;0.001). When EFV ≥134.43 cm3, the hemodynamically significant CAD risk was steeper and gradually reached saturation. Hypertension affected the relationship between EFV and hemodynamically significant CAD (P for the interaction =0.02) with an interaction effect.
CONCLUSIONS: There was a robust relationship between EFV and hemodynamically significant CAD. After adjustment for confounders, we found that the risk of hemodynamically significant CAD onset increased nonlinearly for EFV above 134.4 cm3. This refined understanding of the relationship is helpful for the accurate clinical prediction of hemodynamically significant CAD.
