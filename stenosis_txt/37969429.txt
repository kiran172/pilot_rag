Title: A Cardiac Arrest Case due to Left Coronary Artery Compression in Congenital Heart Disease-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension.

Abstract: We report the case of an adult who had a cardiac arrest in the setting of pulmonary hypertension and a previously repaired intermediate atrioventricular septal defect, with left main coronary trunk stenosis due to dilatation of the main pulmonary artery. In patients with pulmonary hypertension exhibiting anginal symptoms, it is advisable to perform chest contrast computed tomography to confirm the pulmonary artery diameter and the presence of coronary artery compression. In addition, our case highlights the importance of early collaboration among specialists during the transition from adolescence to adulthood.
