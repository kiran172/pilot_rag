Title: Role of Computed Tomography Angiography in the Short-Term Follow-up of Aortic Coarctation Repair.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Coarctation of the aorta (CoA) is a narrowing of the thoracic aorta that often manifests as discrete stenosis but may be tortuous or in long segment. The study aimed to evaluate pre and post-surgical aspects of pediatric patients submitted to CoA surgical correction and to identify possible predisposing factors for aortic recoarctation.
METHODS: Twenty-five patients were divided into groups according to presence (N=8) or absence (N=17) of recoarctation after surgical correction of CoA and evaluated according to clinical-demographic profile, vascular characteristics via computed angiotomography (CAT), and other pathological conditions.
RESULTS: Majority of males (64%), ≥ 15 days old (76%), ≥ 2.5 kg (80%). There was similarity between groups with and without recoarctation regarding sex (male: 87% vs. 53%; P=0.277), age (≥ 15 days: 62.5 vs. 82%; P=0.505), and weight (≥ 2.5 kg: 87.5 vs. 76.5; P=0,492). Altered values of aortic root/Valsalva diameter, proximal transverse arch, and distal isthmus, and normal values for aorta prevailed in preoperative CAT. Normal values for the aortic root/Valsalva sinus diameter were observed with and without recoarctation, the same for both groups regarding ascending and descending aorta in postoperative CAT. No significant difference for altered values of proximal transverse arch and alteration in distal isthmus was observed.
CONCLUSION: No predictive risk for recoarctation was observed. CTA proved to be important in CoA diagnosis and management, since CoA is mainly related with altered diameter of aortic root/sinus of Valsalva and proximal and distal aortic arch/isthmus, however, it failed to show predictive risk for recoarctation.
