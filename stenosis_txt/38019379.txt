Title: Functional bony entrapment of the dorsalis pedis artery caused by cranial subluxation in the talonavicular joint.

Abstract: A 66-year-old female presented in the emergency department with Blue-Toe-Syndrome (BTS) and signs of osteitis of her left big toe. Imaging workup of the peripheral vasculature showed no findings. Upon invasive angiography, severe focal stenosis of the dorsalis pedis artery (DPA) could be seen at the talonavicular joint. Complete regression of the stenosis was inducible by dorsal extension in the ankle joint. Further imaging revealed an underlying subluxation of the talonavicular joint as cause of the arterial compression. Entrapment of the DPA is a rare condition and most often described in relation to connective tissue bands or variant muscular tendons (McCabe et al. 70:213-8, 2021; Weichman et al. 24:113, 2010; Smith et al.58:212-4, 2013; Griffin et al. 20:325-8; 2012). In the presented case, bony compression of the PDA due to cranial subluxation of the talus was seen as the cause of BTS and osteitis of the phalanx of the first toe.
