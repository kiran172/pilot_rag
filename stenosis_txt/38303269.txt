Title: [A Case of Robot-Assisted Laparoscopic Surgery for Stenotic Sigmoid Colon Cancer with Simultaneous Lateral Lymph Node Metastasis].

Abstract: The patient is a 63-year-old man. He visited his previous physician for abdominal pain. After close examinations, he was diagnosed with stenotic sigmoid colon cancer with left lateral lymph node metastasis. On the same day, colonic stenting was performed to relieve the symptoms of stenosis. After 1 month of stenting, a robot-assisted laparoscopic sigmoid colectomy and left lateral lymph node dissection were performed. Postoperative pathological examination revealed regional lymph node metastasis and left lateral lymph node metastasis(#283); the patient was diagnosed with pT4aN1bM1a(LYM), fStage â…£a. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 10, and is stable 5 months after surgery without recurrence. This case suggests that robot-assisted laparoscopic lateral lymph node dissection can be effective even in atypical cases of sigmoid colon cancer with lateral lymph node metastasis.
