Title: Reconstruction of hypopharyngeal defects with anterolateral thigh free flap: A single-center retrospective analysis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Reconstruction of expanded hypopharyngeal defects following laryngo-hypopharyngectomy for surgical treatment of primary is still a challenge for head and neck surgeons. Tradiotionally, jejunal or radial forearm flaps are the common reconstructive choice. Recently, the anterolateral thigh (ALT) free flap has served for pharyngoesophageal reconstruction. The goal of this work is to describe a retrospective analysis about a five-year single-center experience in the reconstruction of post-operative hypopharyngeal defects with ALT free flap.
METHODS: A single-center retrospective study was performed, including patients treated for patients who underwent tumor surgery involving hypopharynx with ALT free flap reconstruction from 2015 to 2020. Exclusion criteria were paediatric (0-18 years) patients, and the absence of follow-up.
RESULTS: The study included 23 adult patients. The mean size of the flap was 90 cm2 (range 60-130 cm2). The mean time required to harvest the antero-lateral tight flap was 70 min (range 35-120 min). The median age was 46.3 years (SD 15.81, range: 19-84 years), with a gender female prevalence (F = 48, M = 33). Mean follow-up was 77.7 months (min 4-max 361, SD 72.46). One patient (4.4 %) showed a hypopharyngeal stenosis.
CONCLUSION: ALT free flap represents a successful and versatile reconstructive option for hypopharyngeal defects extended to oropharynx and/or larynx following total laryngectomy with circumferential or partial hypopharyngectomy, regardless of the functional and aesthetic results, with minimal donor-site complication.
