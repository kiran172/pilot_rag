Title: A Case of End-Stage Renal Disease With Hemifacial Swelling.

Abstract: A 64-year-old male, with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis twice a week for the last two years, presented with swelling over the left half of his face, left side of the neck, and left upper limb for two months. The vascular access for hemodialysis was the left brachiocephalic arteriovenous (AV) fistula. There was no history of insertion of a dialysis catheter on the left side of the neck. Physical examination showed dilated and tortuous veins over the left side of his chest and left arm with normal-functioning AVÂ fistula. Computed tomography (CT) venogram revealed narrowing in the left brachiocephalic vein and cephalic vein with multiple collaterals in the left upper limb and shoulder region. Ballon angioplasty was done across the stenotic segments, and a good flow was achieved with no remnant stenosis. This is a rare presentation as there was no history of cannulation of left-sided central vessels.
