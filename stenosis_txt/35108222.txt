Title: More Endoscopy-Based Brushing Passes Improve the Detection of Malignant Biliary Strictures: A Multicenter Randomized Controlled Trial.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic biliary brushing is the most common method used for sampling in patients with malignant biliary strictures (MBSs); however, its sensitivity is relatively low. There is still no consensus on endoscopy-based biliary brushing, although brushing 10 times in 1 specimen is routinely performed. This study was designed to compare the sensitivity of brush cytology for 10, 20, or 30 brushing times of a pass in 1 specimen in patients with MBSs.
METHODS: In this multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled study, patients who underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for suspected MBSs were enrolled. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 10, 20, and 30 brushing times of a pass. The primary outcome was to compare the sensitivity of brush cytology among the 3 groups. Patients were prospectively followed up for 6 months after endoscopic brushing for malignancy diagnosis.
RESULTS: A total of 443 patients were enrolled for intention-to-treat analysis (147, 148, and 148 patients in the 10-times, 20-times, and 30-time groups, respectively). The 3 groups were similar in baseline characteristics. The sensitivity of brush cytology was 38%, 47%, and 57% in the 10-times, 20-times, and 30-times groups, respectively, and the 30-times group showed significantly higher sensitivity than the 10-times group (P = 0.001). The multivariate analysis revealed that stricture length and the number of brushing passes were significant factors for the detection of biliary malignancy. No significant differences were observed in procedure-related complications among the 3 groups.
DISCUSSION: Brushing 30 times could increase the diagnostic sensitivity without increasing complications and seems to be preferred for the endoscopic sampling and diagnosis of MBSs (chictr.org.cn, identifier: ChiCTR1800015978).
