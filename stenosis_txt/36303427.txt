Title: Pharmacological Effects of Resveratrol in Intervertebral Disc Degeneration: A Literature Review.

Abstract: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) is a high incidence disease of musculoskeletal system that often leads to stenosis, instability, pain and even deformity of the spinal segments. IDD is an important cause of discogenic lower back pain and often leads to large economic burden to families and society. Currently, the treatment of IDD is aimed at alleviating symptoms rather than blocking or reversing pathological progression of the damaged intervertebral disc. Resveratrol (RSV) is a polyphenol phytoalexin first extracted from the Veratrum grandiflflorum O. Loes and can be found in various plants and red wine. Owing to the in-depth study of pharmacological mechanisms, the therapeutic potential of RSV in various diseases such as osteoarthritis, neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases and diabetes have attracted the attention of many researchers. RSV has anti-apoptotic, anti-senescent, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anabolic activities, which can prevent further degeneration of intervertebral disc cells and enhance their regeneration. With high safety and various biological functions, RSV might be a promising candidate for the treatment of IDD. This review summarizes the biological functions of RSV in the treatment of IDD and to facilitate further research.
