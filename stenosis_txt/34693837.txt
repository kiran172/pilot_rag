Title: Mortality in patients with Crohn's disease in Örebro, Sweden 1963-2010.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Some studies have suggested a reduced life expectancy in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) compared with the general population. The evidence, however, is inconsistent.
AIMS: Prompted by such studies, we studied survival of CD patients in Örebro county, Sweden.
METHODS: From the medical records, we identified all patients diagnosed with CD during 1963-2010 with follow-up to the end of 2011. We estimated: overall survival, net and crude probabilities of dying from CD, relative survival ratio (RSR), and excess mortality rate ratios (EMRR) at 10-year follow-up.
RESULTS: The study included 492 patients (226 males, 266 females). Median age at diagnosis was 32 years (3-87). Net and crude probabilities of dying from CD increased with increasing age and were higher for women. Net survival of patients aged ≥60 at diagnosis was worse for patients diagnosed during 1963-1985 (54%) than for patients diagnosed during 1986-1999 (88%) or 2000-2010 (93%). Overall, CD patients' survival was comparable to that in the general population [RSR = 0.98; 95% CI: (0.95-1.00)]. However, significantly lower than expected survival was suggested for female patients aged ≥60 diagnosed during the 1963-1985 [RSR = 0.47 (0.07-0.95)]. The adjusted model suggested that, compared with diagnostic period 1963-1985, disease-related excess mortality declined during 2000-2010 [EMRR = 0.36 (0.07-1.96)]; and age ≥60 at diagnosis [EMRR = 7.99 (1.64-39.00), reference: age 40-59], female sex [EMRR = 4.16 (0.62-27.85)], colonic localization [EMRR = 4.20 (0.81-21.88), reference: ileal localization], and stricturing/penetrating disease [EMRR = 2.56 (0.52-12.58), reference: inflammatory disease behaviour] were associated with poorer survival.
CONCLUSION: CD-related excess mortality may vary with diagnostic period, age, sex and disease phenotype.Key summaryThere is inconsistent evidence on life expectancy of patients with Crohn's diseaseCrohn's disease-specific survival improved over time.Earlier diagnosis period, older age at diagnosis, female sex, colonic disease and complicated disease behaviour seems to be associated with excess Crohn's disease-related mortality.
