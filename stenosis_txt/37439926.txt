Title: Comparable Efficacy of Laser-Cut and Braided Self Expanding Metallic Biliary Stent: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In patients with unresectable malignant biliary obstruction (MBO), endoscopic biliary drainage is the treatment of choice. Self-expanding metallic stents (SEMS) are mainly used for this purpose, and data is limited on the comparative outcomes of laser-cut versus braided SEMS. Herein, we performed the first systematic review and meta-analysis to study the effectiveness and safety of braided and laser-cut SEMS in MBO.
METHODS: Multiple databases, including Medline, Scopus, and Embase, were searched (in May 2022) using specific terms for studies evaluating the outcomes of braided and laser-cut SEMS in MBO. Outcomes of interest were technical and clinical success, recurrent biliary obstruction, and adverse events. Standard meta-analysis methods were employed using the random-effects model. I2% heterogeneity was used to assess the heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Seven studies were included in the final analysis. (Laser-cut: 271 patients, 46% females, mean age 70 years; and braided: 282 patients, 47% females, mean age 72 years). The pooled rate of technical success and clinical success with laser-cut SEMS was 99% (95% CI [95-99; I2 = 0%]), 86% [60-96; I2 = 74%], and 98% [96-99; I2 = 0%], 89% [74-95; I2 = 78%] with braided. The pooled rate of recurrent biliary obstruction with laser-cut SEMS was 26% [14-43; I2 = 88%] and 12% [5-27; I2 = 56%) with braided. Pooled total adverse events were 11% [5-21; I2 = 77%] in laser-cut and 12% [6-24; I2 = 63%] in braided.
CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis demonstrates similar clinical outcomes with laser-cut and braided SEMS in MBO. Given the comparable performance, a cost-effectiveness analysis might help in choosing one type versus another in patients with MBO.
