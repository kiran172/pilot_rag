Title: Our Experience with Laparoscopic Pyloromyotomy in Patients with Infantile Hypertrophic Pyloric Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aim to discuss our experience with laparoscopic pyloromyotomy in patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) and skills development throughout our learning curve.
METHODS: We retrospectively collected data from 15 patients with IHPS who underwent laparoscopic pyloromyotomy between 2016 and 2019 in our clinic. Evolution in operation techniques, peroperative and postoperative surgical complications were analysed.
RESULTS: In this research, 15 patients (male-to-female ratio:2.7/1) were studied. The median age at presentation was 36.5 days (25-100 days). Non-bilious projectile vomiting was seen in all of the patients, and in eight cases, marked failure to thrive was seen. Situs inversus totalis was seen in one of the cases as an associated anomaly, no other anomalies were noted. A palpable olive-shaped mass was found in only 33% of infants (five cases). A patient was detected to have no IHPS peroperatively. One of the cases was converted to open technique due to peroperative technical difficulties. A patient underwent 2nd operation due to incomplete pyloromyotomy. The duration of the first and last cases was 110 mins and 35 mins, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The laparoscopic approach in patients with infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis can result in good postoperative outcomes and satisfying surgery in the hands of surgeons who perform minimally invasive surgery routinely.
