Title: Fusion of Bovine Tissue Aortic Valve Leaflets in a Patient With Left Ventricular Assist Device.

Abstract: Patients with both a prosthetic aortic valve and prolonged left ventricular assist device support can develop rapid deterioration of their valve prosthesis. In patients with myocardial recovery who are undergoing explantation of their ventricular assist device, preoperative and intraoperative evaluation of the valve prosthesis should be performed to ensure adequate function. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
