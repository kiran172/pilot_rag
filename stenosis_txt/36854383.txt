Title: Myocardial Evaluation in Patients with Aortic Stenosis by Cardiac Computed Tomography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic valve stenosis (AVS) is one of the most prevalent pathologies affecting the heart that can curtail expected survival and quality of life if not managed appropriately.
CURRENT STATUS: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has long played a central role in this subset, mostly for severity assessment and for procedural planning. Although not as widely accepted as other imaging modalities for functional myocardial assessment [i. e., transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)], this technique has recently increased its clinical application in this regard.
FUTURE OUTLOOK: The ability to provide morphological, functional, tissue, and preprocedural information highlights the potential of the "all-in-one" concept of cardiac CT as a potential reality for the near future for AVS assessment. In this review article, we sought to analyze the current applications of cardiac CT that allow a full comprehensive evaluation of aortic valve disease.
KEY POINTS: · Noninvasive myocardial tissue characterization stopped being an exclusive feature of cardiac magnetic resonance.. · Emerging acquisition methods make cardiac CT an accurate and widely accessible imaging modality.. · Cardiac CT has the potential to become a "one-stop" exam for comprehensive aortic stenosis assessment..
