Title: The Need for Studies on Oral Corticosteroids After Sialendoscopy for Obstructive Salivary Gland Disease: Systematic Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This qualitative systematic review evaluates the evidence in support of the use of oral corticosteroids in patients undergoing sialendoscopy for the treatment of obstructive sialadenitis.
DESIGN: Qualitative systematic review.
METHODS: A literature search was conducted from January 1985 and September 2020. Inclusion criteria embraced peer-reviewed articles in which adult patients undergoing interventional sialendoscopy for obstructive salivary gland disease received oral corticosteroids. The results were initially screened based on title and abstract, and the remaining articles were reviewed for eligibility.
RESULTS: About 218 papers were selected by title and abstract, 96 were selected for full-text review, and 9 met the inclusion criteria. Eight published reports were retrospective observational studies and 1 was a prospective comparative study. Overall, the heterogeneity of clinical data stood out in this systematic review. The pooled success rate in the studies was 873/979 (89%). Only 5 studies described a rationale for oral corticosteroid use as part of the post-operative management. In 4 studies, a prednisone total daily dose of 40 to 50 mg was used. One study clearly showed a lower recurrence rate in patients who received oral steroids for more than 7 days in addition to sialendoscopy for management of ductal stenoses.
CONCLUSION: This systematic review showed that most centers that prescribe oral corticosteroids after sialendoscopy are unaware of the specific results with this treatment. For ductal stenoses, only 1 paper clearly showed the benefits of oral corticosteroids after sialendoscopy but more high-quality evidence is required in the form of a comparative study or randomized controlled trial, with appropriate long-term follow up.
