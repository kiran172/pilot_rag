Title: Cerebral Embolic Protection during Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation: Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: In patient undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), stroke remains a potentially devastating complication associated with significant morbidity, and mortality. To reduce the risk of stroke, cerebral protection devices (CPD) were developed to prevent debris from embolizing to the brain during TAVI. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the safety and efficacy of CPD in TAVI. The MEDLINE (PubMed, Ovid) and Cochrane databases were queried with various combinations of medical subject headings to identify relevant articles. Statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model to calculate unadjusted odds ratio (OR), including subgroup analyses based on follow-up duration, study design, and type of CPD. Using a pooled analysis, CPD was associated with a significant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events MACE (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.70-0.81, P < 0.01), mortality (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.58-0.74, P < 0.01) and stroke (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76-0.93, P < 0.01) in patients undergoing TAVI. Similarly, on MRI volume per lesion were lower for patients with CPD use. No significant difference was observed in acute kidney injury (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.42-1.37, P = 0.68), bleeding (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.71-1.20, P = 0.55) or vascular complications (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.62-1.31, P = 0.6) for patients undergoing TAVI with CPD. In conclusion, CPD device use in TAVI is associated with a reduction of MACE, mortality, and stroke compared with patients undergoing TAVI without CPD. However, the significant reduction in mortality is driven mainly by observational studies.
