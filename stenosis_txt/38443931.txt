Title: Study on the rationality of small diameter metallic airway stent in treatment of tracheal stenosis in injured rabbits.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To observe the occurrence of related complications after self-expandable metallic (SEM) airway stents implantation with different diameters at different time points, and to provide theoretical basis for the optimal chioce of existing airway stents in clinical practice.
METHODS: Healthy New Zealand white rabbits were used to establish benign tracheal stenosis models after chest CT examination. Forty-fivemodel rabbits with more than 50% of airway stenosis were divided into two groups. Small-diameter SEM stents (The ratio of stent diameter to airway diameter is nearly 1.0) were implanted in Group A in 21 rabbits, and large-diameter tracheal stents (The ratio of stent diameter to airway diameter is more than 1.2) were implanted in Group B in 24 rabbits. Stent-related complications were observed after stent implantation in 2nd,4th,8th, and 12th week by bronchoscopygross anatomy, pathological and the expressions of IL-1RA, IL-8 and MMP9 in involved tracheal.
RESULTS: The incidence rate of tracheomalacia of stent was significantly higher in group B (24/24 100%) than that in group A (1 /21,4.8%) (P < 0.05). The incidence rate of scar contracture at both ends of stent was significantly higher than in group B (11 / 24,45.8%) that in group A (2 /21, 9.5%) (P < 0.05). The pathological results of both A and B showed that the columnar epithelium of bronchial mucosa began to damage and detach, inflammatory cells infiltrated after 2nd and 4th week of stenting, The epithelium was repaired, the lamina propria glands almost disappeared, collagen fiber proliferation was obvious, and scars were formed after 8th and 12th week of stenting. ELISA results revealed that the expressions of IL-1RA, IL-8, and MMP9 were increased in the stent group than in model rabbit with benign tracheal stenosis. IL-1RA and MMP9 increased at different periods in group B, but the expression of IL-1RA and MMP9 showed a tread of increasing in the early stage and then decreasing in group A.
CONCLUSION: Metal stents can cause different degrees of stent-related complications in rabbits with benign tracheal stenosis. The incidence of stent-induced tracheomalacia and scar contracture were higher in Group B than that in Group A. IL-1RA, IL-8 and MMP9 may be involved in the development of complications after stentimplantation and peak value of group B movered backward. ing.
