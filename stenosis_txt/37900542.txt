Title: An Infrequently Encountered Cause of Hemoptysis.

Abstract: Mitral stenosis (MS) is not a common entity in modern-day medicine, especially in developed countries, as the most common etiology is still rheumatic fever.Â MS can present mainly with a wide range of cardiac symptoms. However, infrequently, MS can cause extra-cardiac symptoms as well. We present a case report of a patient with severe bioprosthetic mitral valve stenosis with intermittent hemoptysis and cardiogenic shock. We aim to report this case to remind clinicians about this uncommon but significant cause of hemoptysis. This case report also emphasizes the importance of utilizing a team approach while treating patients with severe MS, especially if they have serious complications that could be life-threatening. We also aim to add to the current literature by reporting this case.
