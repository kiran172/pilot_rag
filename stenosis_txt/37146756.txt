Title: Spontaneous CSF fistula as a manifestation of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Spontaneous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fistula, of unknown origin, is a rare condition whose aetiology is increasingly related to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). This study tries to raise awareness that they should not be considered as two different processes, but that fistulas can be a form of debut, requiring a study and subsequent treatment. Repair techniques are described, as well as the study of HII.
RESULTS: We treated 8 patients, 5 women and three men, aged between 46 and 72 years, with a diagnosis of spontaneous CSF fistula, four nasal and four otics who underwent surgical treatment. After repair, a diagnostic study was performed for IIH by MRI and Angio-MRI, presenting in all cases a transverse venous sinus stenosis. The intracranial pressure values obtained by lumbar puncture showed values of 20mm Hg or higher. All patients were diagnosed with HII. The one-year follow-up did not reveal any recurrence of the fistulas, maintaining a control of the HII.
CONCLUSION: Despite their low frequency of both cranial CSF fistula and IIH, an association of both conditions should be considered by continuing the study and surveillance of these patients after fistula closure.
