Title: Urologic dermatology: a comprehensive foray into the noninfectious etiologies of balanitis.

Abstract: Balanitis is classically defined as inflammation of the glans penis, often also encompassing the prepuce (balanoposthitis). Several investigations have found that a sizable proportion of urology clinic visits are due to balanitis or related complaints. Balanitis can have numerous complications, including severe pain, urethral stenosis, phimosis, sexual dysfunction, and if untreated, malignancy. Unfortunately, there is no recent or comprehensive review that describes the various etiologies, clinical workup, and treatments for balanitis. Herein this review, we attempt to provide the reader with a complete and updated guide to balanitis in an attempt to improve clinical outcomes.
