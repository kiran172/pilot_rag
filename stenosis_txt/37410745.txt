Title: Intermediate-Term Outcomes Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Patients with a History of Chest Radiation Therapy: A Propensity Score Matched Analysis.

Abstract: Chest radiation therapy (XRT) has been associated with a higher rate of mortality following surgical aortic valve replacement. We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI from January 1 2012 to July 31 2020 comparing patients with and without XRT. A total of 915 patients met inclusion criteria, with a total of 50 patients found to have a history of XRT. At a mean follow-up of 2.4 years, unadjusted and propensity score matching analysis demonstrated no differences in mortality, heart failure or bleeding-related hospitalization, overall stroke, and 30-day pacemaker implantation in patients with and without XRT.
