Title: The flow index provides a comprehensive assessment of erectile dysfunction by combining blood flow velocity and vascular diameter.

Abstract: Dynamic duplex sonography (DUS) is not comprehensive in the evaluation of arteriogenic erectile dysfunction (ED). We introduced a new parameter, the flow index (FI), into the assessment of arteriogenic ED. A retrospective review of a prospective database was conducted. Patients undergoing DUS and pelvic computed tomography angiography for the evaluation of ED were included. The FI was calculated from peak systolic velocity (PSV) and the percentages of pelvic arterial (PLA) stenosis. Correlations between PSV, PLA stenosis, the FI, and erectile function were calculated. Eighty-three patients were included. Compared with PSV, the FI had better correlations with the erection hardness score (EHS) (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.405, P &lt; 0.001 for FI; r<sub>s</sub> = 0.294, P = 0.007 for PSV). For EHS &lt; 3, the areas under the ROC curve of FI and PSV were 0.759 and 0.700, respectively. In patients with normal DUS but EHS &lt; 3, PLA stenosis was more severe (62.5% vs. 10.0%, P = 0.015), and the FI was lower (8.35 vs. 57.78, P = 0.006), while PSV was not different. The FI is better than PSV in the evaluation of arteriogenic ED. On the other hand, assessment of the pelvic arterial system should be included in the evaluation of ED.
