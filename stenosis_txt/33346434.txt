Title: [Role of magnetic resonance imaging in patients with aortic stenosis before and after replacement of the valve].

Abstract: Risk stratification among patients with aortic stenosis remains inadequate, and there is a clinical need for the correct identification of high-risk patients who would benefit from aortic valve intervention before developing left ventricular decompensation. Since the publication of the results of the PARTNER study, transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has become the method of choice for aortic valve stenosis in inoperable patients and is a real alternative to conventional surgical replacement of the aortic valve in high-risk patients. In planning TAVI and postoperative monitoring of a patient from imaging methods, the leading role is played by echocardiography and multispiral computed tomography. However, in recent years, the interest of researchers in the use of magnetic resonance imaging in this category of patients has increased. The review article examines the potential role of magnetic resonance imaging in patients with aortic stenosis before and after TAVI.
