Title: Asymptomatic Giant Aneurysm of the Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: The most common cause of coronary artery aneurysms is atherosclerosis, which is associated with over 50% of all aneurysms diagnosed in adults. Although patients can be asymptomatic throughout their lives, giant coronary artery aneurysms can manifest themselves as myocardial infarction, aneurysmal rupture, and sudden cardiac death as well. Herein, we describe an asymptomatic patient with numerous risk factors and a positive cardiopulmonary exercise test who was admitted to the cardiology clinic for coronary angiography. A giant coronary artery aneurysm (3.0Ã—2.0 cm in diameter) in the left anterior descending coronary artery and significant stenosis in both left and right coronary arteries were found. After discussing possible treatment options, the hospital's heart team recommended the surgical resection of the aneurysm and double coronary artery bypass graft. Four years after the cardiac surgery, at the time of writing the current manuscript, the patient is still in good condition and with no symptoms.
