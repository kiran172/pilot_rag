Title: Prevalence of rheumatic heart disease in adults from the Brazilian Amazon Basin.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) continues to be a burden in low- and middle-income countries and prevalence estimates are lacking from South America. We aimed to determine the prevalence of RHD in the Brazilian Amazon Basin.
METHODS: We examined a random sample of adults (≥18 years) from the general population, who underwent echocardiographic image acquisition by a medical doctor. All images were analyzed according to (i) the 2012 World Heart Federation criteria and (ii) a simplified algorithm for RHD from a previously validated risk score (categories: low-, medium-, high-risk) which involved assessment of the mitral valve (leaflet thickening and excessive motion, regurgitation jet length) and aortic valve (thickening and any regurgitation).
RESULTS: A total of 488 adults were screened (mean age 40 ± 15 years, 38% men). The prevalence of RHD was 39/1000 adults (n = 17 definite and n = 2 borderline). Fourteen (74%) had pathological mitral regurgitation, four (21%) mitral stenosis, 0 (0%) pathological aortic regurgitation and six (32%) both mitral and aortic valve disease. None had a prior diagnosis of RHD, 10 (53%) had positive cardiac auscultation and two (11%) reported a history of rheumatic fever. The simplified algorithm identified four (21%) adults as low-risk, six (32%) as intermediate, and nine (47%) as high-risk.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of RHD was 39/1000 in adults from the Brazilian Amazon Basin, indicating the need for screening programs in remote areas. A simplified model was only able to categorize every second case of RHD as high-risk. External validation of simplified screening models to increase feasibility in clinical practice are encouraged.
