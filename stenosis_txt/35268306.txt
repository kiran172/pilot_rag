Title: Potential Molecular Biomarkers of Central Nervous System Damage in Breast Cancer Survivors.

Abstract: Damage of the central nervous system (CNS), manifested by cognitive impairment, occurs in 80% of women with breast cancer (BC) as a complication of surgical treatment and radiochemotherapy. In this study, the levels of ICAM-1, PECAM-1, NSE, and anti-NR-2 antibodies which are associated with the damage of the CNS and the endothelium were measured in the blood by ELISA as potential biomarkers that might reflect pathogenetic mechanisms in these patients. A total of 102 patients enrolled in this single-center trial were divided into four groups: (1) 26 patients after breast cancer treatment, (2) 21 patients with chronic brain ischemia (CBI) and asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ICA stenosis) (CBI + ICA stenosis), (3) 35 patients with CBI but without asymptomatic carotid stenosis, and (4) 20 healthy female volunteers (control group). Intergroup analysis demonstrated that in the group of patients following BC treatment there was a significant increase of ICAM-1 (mean difference: −368.56, 95% CI −450.30 to −286.69, p < 0.001) and PECAM-1 (mean difference: −47.75, 95% CI −68.73 to −26.77, p < 0.001) molecules, as compared to the group of healthy volunteers. Additionally, a decrease of anti-NR-2 antibodies (mean difference: 0.89, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.48, p < 0.001) was detected. The intergroup comparison revealed comparable levels of ICAM-1 (mean difference: −33.58, 95% CI −58.10 to 125.26, p = 0.76), PECAM-1 (mean difference: −5.03, 95% CI −29.93 to 19.87, p = 0.95), as well as anti-NR-2 antibodies (mean difference: −0.05, 95% CI −0.26 to 0.16, p = 0.93) in patients after BC treatment and in patients with CBI + ICA stenosis. The NSE level in the group CBI + ICA stenosis was significantly higher than in women following BC treatment (mean difference: −43.64, 95% CI 3.31 to −83.99, p = 0.03). Comparable levels of ICAM-1 were also detected in patients after BC treatment and in the group of CBI (mean difference: −21.28, 95% CI −111.03 to 68.48, p = 0.92). The level of PECAM-1 molecules in patients after BC treatment was also comparable to group of CBI (mean difference: −13.68, 95% CI −35.51 to 8.15, p = 0.35). In conclusion, among other mechanisms, endothelial dysfunction might play a role in the damage of the CNS in breast cancer survivors.
