Title: [Update to the position paper of the Italian Society of Interventional Cardiology (SICI-GISE) on institutional and operator requirements for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Chapter 2: Technical nursing care in TAVI].

Abstract: Calcific degenerative aortic stenosis is the most frequent valve disease in the western population. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation procedures are significantly increasing, as they now represent the first choice in inoperable patients and have been shown to be non-inferior to cardiac surgery in patients at high and intermediate surgical risk. In this scenario, it is necessary to define and standardize the technical nursing care to guarantee patient safety and improve quality of care.The purpose of this document is to propose, on the basis on currently available literature, a model for the development of assistance based on shared objectives and clinical competence.
