Title: [Chronic intestinal failure].

Abstract: The term intestinal failure (IF) is understood as the transient or irreversible loss of the resorptive capacity of the bowels. This includes a multitude of diseases, some of which have anatomical causes and others functional causes. The functional capacity (absorption and motility) of the remaining digestive tract and the bacterial overgrowth and false colonization of the small bowel are of prognostic importance. After exclusion of pathological intestinal findings, such as stenosis and dilatation, initially conservative treatment is employed with the aim of intestinal adaptation. Before failure or complications, initially conservative surgery and then organ replacement by transplantation should be considered. The IF is a temporary or permanent condition. For adults a length of 100cm small bowel without the colon, 60cm still with continuity to the colon and 35cm small bowel with complete preservation of the colon including the ileocecal valve are potentially sufficient for intestinal autonomy.
