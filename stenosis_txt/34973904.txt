Title: 10-Year All-Cause Mortality Following Percutaneous or Surgical Revascularization in Patients With Heavy Calcification.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess 10-year all-cause mortality in patients with heavily calcified lesions (HCLs) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).
BACKGROUND: Limited data are available on very long term outcomes in patients with HCLs according to the mode of revascularization.
METHODS: This substudy of the SYNTAXES (Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery Extended Survival) study assessed 10-year all-cause mortality according to the presence of HCLs within lesions with >50% diameter stenosis and identified during the calculation of the anatomical SYNTAX (Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery) score among 1,800 patients with the 3-vessel disease and/or left main disease randomized to PCI or CABG in the SYNTAX trial. Patients with HCLs were further stratified according to disease type (3-vessel disease or left main disease) and assigned treatment (PCI or CABG).
RESULTS: The 532 patients with ≥1 HCL had a higher crude mortality rate at 10 years than those without (36.4% vs 22.3%; HR: 1.79; 95% CI: 1.49-2.16; P &lt; 0.001). After adjustment, an HCL remained an independent predictor of 10-year mortality (HR: 1.36; 95% CI: 1.09-1.69; P = 0.006). There was a significant interaction in mortality between treatment effect (PCI and CABG) and the presence or absence of HCLs (P<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.005). In patients without HCLs, mortality was significantly higher after PCI than after CABG (26.0% vs 18.8%; HR: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.97-1.41; P = 0.003), whereas in those with HCLs, there was no significant difference (34.0% vs 39.0%; HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.64-1.13; P = 0.264).
CONCLUSIONS: At 10 years, the presence of an HCL was an independent predictor of mortality, with a similar prognosis following PCI or CABG. Whether HCLs require special consideration when deciding the mode of revascularization beyond their current contribution to the anatomical SYNTAX score deserves further evaluation.
