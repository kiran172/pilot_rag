Title: [Stenotic ischemic enteritis secondary to intraperitoneal band infiltration: a case report].

Abstract: A 55-year-old man presented with vomiting and upper abdominal pain. Two months later, computed tomography revealed jejunal wall thickening and contrast enhancement. Double-balloon endoscopy revealed severe jejunal stenosis and mucosal prolapse. The patient was diagnosed with stenotic ischemic small bowel inflammation and underwent partial small bowel resection. Clinicians should consider intraperitoneal band formation in the differential diagnosis of patients without a history of abdominal surgery or trauma. Surgical resection should be considered to prevent strangulation ileus.
