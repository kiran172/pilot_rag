Title: Diagnostic value of endoscopic ultrasound in groove pancreatitis.

Abstract: Aim: Groove pancreatitis (GP) is a rare type of chronic pancreatitis characterized by varying degrees of thickening and scarring of the duodenal wall, duodenal lumen stenosis, mucosal hypertrophy with plicae and cyst formation. GP is primarily observed in middle-aged male patients with a history of alcohol consumption. Clinical symptoms are usually non-specific, and there is currently no unified diagnostic standard. However, imaging methods, particularly endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), are useful for diagnosis. EUS-guided biopsy can provide a strong basis for the final diagnosis. This review summarizes the value of EUS and its derivative technologies in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis and treatment of GP.Methods: After searching in PubMed and Web of Science databases using 'groove pancreatitis (GP)' and 'endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)' as keywords, studies related were compiled and examined.Results: EUS and its derivative technologies are of great significance in the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of GP, but there are still limitations that need to be comprehensively applied with other diagnostic methods to obtain the most accurate results.Conclusion: EUS has unique value in both the diagnosis and treatment of GP. Clinicians need to be well-versed in the advantages and limitations of EUS for GP diagnosis to select the most suitable imaging diagnostic method for different cases and to reduce the unnecessary waste of medical resources.
