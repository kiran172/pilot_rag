Title: Young gastric cancer patient with high CA19-9 complicated by Trousseau syndrome.

Abstract: A 47-year-old Japanese woman presented with epigastric discomfort and anorexia. Upper endoscopy showed type 4 advanced gastric cancer in the gastric antrum with stenosis of the pyloric portion. Abdominopelvic CT revealed peritoneal dissemination, and stage IV advanced gastric cancer was diagnosed. Laparoscopic gastrojejunostomy and enterostomy were performed. Trousseau syndrome occurred 7 days post-surgery. Despite appropriate treatment, the patient developed a pulmonary embolism 13 days later and died 18 days post-surgery. Even in young cancer patients without lifestyle disease complications, it is important to pay attention to Trousseau syndrome as part of cancer management.
