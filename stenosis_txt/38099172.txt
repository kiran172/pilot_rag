Title: Renal Transplant Artery Stenosis and Kinking: An Unusual Association.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis of the kidney allograft associated with kinking is not a frequent finding. As a correctable cause of graft dysfunction, it is important to diagnose it as soon as possible to avoid further graft damage and improve graft and patient survival. As pulsed wave Doppler ultrasound mapping of the graft's renal arteries is essential to diagnose possible alterations, point of care ultrasound (POCUS) is a highly useful tool for early diagnosis. We present a case in which nephrologists performed this examination promptly allowing a timely diagnosis and treatment plan.
