Title: Nasal Obstruction in the Infant.

Abstract: Neonatal nasal obstruction is common in both the hospital and clinic settings. Causes can range from rhinitis to congenital masses, with a wide variety of congenital nasal masses described. A complete history and physical examination are necessary for correct diagnosis and management. Arhinia and bilateral choanal atresia will present with complete obstruction leading to forced mouth breathing. Partial obstruction will require assessment of nasal patency with possible nasal endoscopy and imaging. Medical and surgical options for treatment are discussed.
