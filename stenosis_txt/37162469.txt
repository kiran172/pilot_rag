Title: Management of biliary complications in liver transplant recipients using a fully covered self-expandable metal stent with antimigration features.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Following liver transplant (LT) with duct-to-duct anastomosis, biliary strictures and leaks are typically managed with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and stenting. While multiple side-by-side plastic stents are typically used for management of anastomotic strictures, fully covered self-expandable metal stents (FCSEMS) can be used to decrease the number of ERCPs with longer periods of stent patency. The risk of migration can limit their use. FCSEMS with antimigration fins to manage benign biliary complications following LT may provide stricture resolution with limited adverse events (AEs).
METHODS: Single center retrospective study of LT patients who required FCSEMS from 1/2014 to 4/2022. Primary outcomes included stricture resolution and recurrence. Secondary outcomes were stent migration, occlusion, removability, and number of ERCPs.
RESULTS: Forty-three patients (mean age 55.5 years) with anastomotic strictures (N.=37), bile leaks (N.=4) or both (N.=2) were included. The median time from LT to FCSEMS placement was 125 days. Within one year of LT, 31 patients required intervention; early intervention at less than 30 and 90 days was needed in 7 and 19 patients, respectively. The median length of follow-up was 816.5 days. Stricture resolution was seen in 35 patients (81%) after a median stent dwell time of 130.5 days; recurrence occurred in 8 patients. There were three instances of partial stent migration that did not require reintervention or interfere with removability. The mean number of ERCPs required was 2.5.
CONCLUSIONS: The use of a FCSEMS with antimigration features yields effective stricture resolution with longer stent dwell times and fewer ERCPs.
