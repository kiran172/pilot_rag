Title: Case of lumbar spinal stenosis and chronic tophaceous gout.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Rarely, chronic tophaceous gout can result in lumbar spinal stenosis and neural compression.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 67-year-old male presented with the radiographic and magnetic resonance findings of gout involving and causing compression of the lumbar spine that responded to surgical decompression.
CONCLUSION: It is difficult to diagnose lumbar spinal stenosis secondary to tophaceous gout. Notably, the treatment, based on the clinical presentation, may include both medication and surgical decompression.
