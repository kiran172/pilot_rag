Title: [Urethroplasty technological changes for the treatment of male urethral stricture].

Abstract: Urethroplasty is an important method to treat male urethral stricture. Nowadays, urethroplasty mainly includes two types: anastomotic urethroplasty and substitution urethroplasty. Anastomotic urethroplasty mainly includes primary anastomosis urethroplasty and non-transecting anastomotic urethroplasty. Substitution of urethroplasty mainly includes staged urethroplasty and one-stage urethroplasty. Substitution materials always are chosen by pedicle skin flap and free mucosal graft. Anastomosis urethroplasty has shown good results in short bulbar urethral stricture and posterior urethral stricture after pelvic fracture. Among them, non-transecting anastomosis urethroplasty has become a new surgical method for iatrogenic, single, short or non-occluded stenosis. At present, the one-stage substitution urethroplasty is the most widely used. However, there are still many complicated cases that must be solved by staged urethroplasty. Pedicle skin flap and oral mucosa are widely used as substitutes at present. How to select the best surgical procedure and substitute materials individually would be the problem worthy of attention in the future. Accumulating more long-term follow-up data is helpful for objective comparison of various surgical procedures and grafts.
