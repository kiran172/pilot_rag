Title: A Peculiar Case of Isolated Bilateral Tympanic Plate Fractures.

Abstract: Tympanic plate fractures are uncommon injuries and carry the risk of external auditory canal stenosis. TheseÂ injuries are often associated with fractures of adjacent bones like the mandible, maxilla, and temporal bone. Isolated bilateral tympanic bone fractures have rarely been reported. The most frequently advocated treatment for these injuries is surgical to prevent canal stenosis in the future. The effectiveness of non-operative management has been seldom reported. In the current case report, we present an uncommon injury with isolated bilateral tympanic plate fractures secondary to trauma to the mandible with no associated mandible or condylar fractures that were treated non-operatively. The functional outcomes were favorable at one year of follow-up.
