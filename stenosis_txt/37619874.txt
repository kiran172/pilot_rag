Title: An 18-year evolution of congenital heart disease in China: An echocardiographic database-based study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Data on the evolution of congenital heart disease (CHD) in China remain scarce. Based on a Chinese echocardiography database, we analyzed the observed rate (OR) and spectrum changes of CHD over the past 18 years with a focus on the congenital aortic valve malformation (CAVM) and Adult CHD (ACHD).
METHODS AND RESULTS: The transthoracic echocardiographic data of 682,565 records from 2003 to 2020 were retrospectively reviewed at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital, China. A total of 37,200 CHD cases were recruited in this study. Over the three periods (from 2003 to 2008, 2009-2014, to 2015-2020), the OR of Total CHD decreased (106.72, 90.64, and 67.43 per 1000 cases, respectively); the proportion of Simple CHD to Total CHD increased (80.96%, 83.41%, and 87.97%, respectively), with a decrease in the proportion of Complex CHD (18.11%, 15.51%, and 10.42%, respectively) (p < 0.05 for all). The proportion of ACHD increased in most types of CHD [Total CHD: 25.79%, 27.84%, and 31.43%; CAVM: 69.02%, 73.42%, and 78.16%; CAVM with aortic stenosis (AS): 67.42%, 70.73%, and 79.25%; respectively, p < 0.05 for all], with a much higher proportion in both CAVM and CAVM with AS than in the other CHD types. The proportion of CHD patients receiving intervention increased over the designated periods.
CONCLUSIONS: This study depicts the longitudinal changes of CHD in the Chinese population with a single-center echocardiographic data, revealing an increased proportion of Simple CHD, ACHD (including CAVM and CAVM with AS), and a decreased OR of Total CHD and proportion of Complex CHD.
