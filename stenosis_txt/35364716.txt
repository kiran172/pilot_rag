Title: Carotid vulnerable plaque coexisting with cerebral small vessel disease and acute ischemic stroke: a Chinese Atherosclerosis Risk Evaluation study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the associations between carotid vulnerable plaque features coexisting with cerebral small vessel diseases (CSVDs) and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and, furthermore, to determine whether coexisting diseases had a stronger association with AIS than a single disease.
METHODS: Patients with cerebrovascular symptoms and carotid plaque were recruited from the cross-sectional, multicenter CARE-II study. The population was divided into two groups (AIS and transient ischemic stroke (TIA)). MRI features of carotid plaques (including luminal stenosis and plaque vulnerabilities) and CSVDs (such as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) and lacunes) were evaluated. Coexisting diseases were defined as the presence of at least one carotid plaque features and one or more CSVDs feature. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to examine the associations between coexisting diseases and AIS.
RESULTS: Of the recruited 634 patients (mean age: 59.1 ± 11.3 years; 429 males), 312 (49.2%) patients had AIS. These subjects had a higher prevalence of carotid vulnerable plaques, lacunes, and moderate-to-severe WMHs (a total Fazekas score of 3-6) than those with TIA (42.6% vs. 29.5%, 59.6% vs. 26.4%, 69.9% vs. 60.6%, respectively, all p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that carotid plaque features coexisting with lacunes or moderate-to-severe WMHs had a stronger association with AIS compared to carotid lesions alone (all p < 0.05) (i.e., vulnerable plaque coexisting with lacunes vs. vulnerable plaque alone, adjusted odds ratio: 3.67 vs. 1.62).
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid vulnerable plaque features coexisting with CSVDs, particularly lacunes, had a stronger association with AIS compared to carotid lesions alone in a large, symptomatic, cohort.

CLINICALTRIALS: gov , unique identifier: NCT02017756 KEY POINTS: • Carotid vulnerable plaque features coexisting with cerebral small vessel diseases, such as lacunes, had a stronger association with acute ischemic stroke compared to single diseases in symptomatic patients. • A comprehensive assessment of coexisting cerebrovascular diseases may help stratify the risk of acute ischemic stroke.
