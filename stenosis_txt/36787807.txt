Title: Impact of neighborhood social disadvantage on carotid artery disease presentation, management, and discharge outcomes.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have highlighted that race and socioeconomic status serve as important determinants of disease presentation and perioperative outcomes in carotid artery disease. However, these investigations only focus on individual factors of social disadvantage, and fail to account for community factors that may drive disparities. Area Deprivation Index (ADI) is a validated measure of neighborhood adversity that offers a more comprehensive assessment of social disadvantage. We examined the impact of ADI ranking on carotid artery disease severity, management, and postoperative outcomes.
METHODS: We identified patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA), transfemoral carotid artery stenting (tfCAS), and transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR) in the Vascular Quality Initiative registry between 2016 and 2020. Patients were assigned ADI scores of 1 to 100 based on zip codes and grouped into quintiles, with higher quintiles reflecting increasing adversity. Outcomes assessed included disease presentation, intervention type, and discharge patterns. Logistic regression was used to evaluate independent associations between ADI quintiles and these outcomes.
RESULTS: Among 91,904 patients undergoing carotid revascularization, 9811 (10.7%) were in the lowest ADI quintile (Q1), 18,905 (20.6%) in Q2, 25,442 (27.7%) in Q3, 26,099 (28.4%) in Q4, and 11,647 (12.7%) in Q5. With increasing ADI quintiles, patients were more likely to present with symptomatic disease (Q5, 52.1% vs Q1, 46.6%; P < .001), and stroke vs transient ischemic attack (Q5, 63.1% vs Q1, 53.5%; P < .001); they also more frequently underwent CAS vs CEA (Q5, 46.4% vs Q1, 33.9%; P < .001), and specifically tfCAS vs TCAR (Q5, 54.2% vs Q1, 33.9%; P < .001). In adjusted analyses, higher ADI quintiles remained as independent risk factors for presenting with symptomatic disease and stroke and undergoing CAS and tfCAS. Across ADI quintiles, patients were more likely to experience death (Q5, 0.8% vs Q1, 0.4%; P < .001), stroke/death (Q5, 2.1% vs Q1, 1.6%; P = .001), failure to discharge home (Q5, 11.5% vs Q1, 8.0%; P < .001) and length of stay >2 days (Q5, 33.3% vs Q1, 26.3%; P < .001) following revascularization.
CONCLUSIONS: Among carotid revascularization patients, those with greater neighborhood social disadvantage had greater disease severity and more frequently underwent tfCAS. These patients also had higher rates of death and stroke/death, were less frequently discharged home, and had prolonged hospital stays. Greater efforts are needed to ensure that patients in higher ADI quintiles undergo better carotid surveillance and are treated appropriately for their carotid artery disease.
