Title: Systemic inflammation index as useful tool to predict arteriovenous graft stenosis: Our experience and literature review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Many studies show that settings of severe inflammatory stress might be responsible for changes in circulating blood cells count. Effective inflammation indices are created calculating the quantitative relationship between these cells. No previous studies have been proposed on hemodialysis patients exploring the association between arteriovenous graft (AVG) stenosis and systemic inflammation markers, such as Neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and systemic-immune-inflammation index (SII).
METHODS: Patients undergone surgery for AVG creation in a 2-year period are examined. Examining their full blood count, we have established the value of inflammatory indices (NLR, PLR, SII) and we have compared their mean values in patients who have developed significant stenosis or not. Finally, we have considered the connection between those values and stenosis onset and recurrence in AVG.
RESULTS: Fifty-two patients are included in the study [male: 40%, mean age 70 ± 15 years (range 55-86)]. We have found out there is not statistical significance in preoperative values of inflammatory index (NLR p 0.33, PLR p 0.15, SII p 0.98) Otherwise NLR and SII indices were statistically significant 3 months after surgery (NLR 2.04 ± 0.98 vs 3.91 ± 2.10, p &lt; 0.001; SII 415.32 ± 255.15 vs 636.91 ± 349.01, p 0.014).
CONCLUSIONS: Increased post-operative values of NLR and SII have proved a strong association with AVG outflow stenosis onset and recurrence.
