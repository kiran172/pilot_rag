Title: Trends in mortality among the geriatric population undergoing Surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) and potential racial disparities: a 20-year perspective via the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in cardiovascular conditions are well documented. Whether similar race-based discrepancies in health outcomes also exist among elderly patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for aortic stenosis remains understudied.
METHODS: We abstracted data from the National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample over a 20-year period from 2001 to 2020 using specific ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes. We included patients aged ≥ 60 and ≤ 80 years with races recorded as White, African American, or Hispanic at the time of their hospitalization for surgery. We analyzed and reported the baseline characteristics, risk-adjusted in-hospital mortality, and complications stratified by race.
RESULTS: Of 420,181 patients studied, 90.0% identified as White, 4.0% as African American and 6.0% as Hispanic. Despite a decrease in overall in-hospital mortality rates from 3.8% between 2001-2005 to 1.8% between 2016-2020, African Americans had higher odds of all-cause in-hospital deaths compared to Whites (aOR = 1.390, P &lt; 0.001). Additionally, they were more likely to experience cardiogenic shock (aOR = 1.241, P &lt; 0.001) and acute kidney injury (aOR = 1.314, P &lt; 0.001) as well as more likely to require organ support such as IABP use (aOR = 1.336, P &lt; 0.001) or invasive mechanical ventilation (aOR = 1.342, P &lt; 0.001). Interestingly, African Americans were less likely to report events of acute ischemic stroke compared to Whites (aOR = 0.852, P &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a reassuring reduction in overall in-hospital mortality rates of geriatric patients undergoing SAVR for aortic stenosis, racial disparities in health outcomes remain pervasive with minorities more likely to report higher in-hospital morbidity and mortality.
