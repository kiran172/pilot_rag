Title: [Covered endovascular reconstruction of aortic bifurcation (CERAB)].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortoiliac stenosis is common cause of peripheral arterial disease (PAD), which is particularly prevalent in older age (> 60 years) with a prevalence of 20%. In early stages (TASC [Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society Consensus] II A/B), these stenoses can be successfully treated by endovascular procedures. For more complex aortoiliac stenoses (TASC II C/D), open surgical treatment was the primary treatment in the past.
CLINICAL ISSUE: Because of the advanced age and multiple comorbidities of PAD patients with complex aortoiliac stenoses, open surgical treatment is usually associated with high risk, and therefore endovascular procedures are an alternative despite their poorer outcome. Covered endovascular reconstruction of the aortic bifurcation (CERAB) aims to improve the primary patency rate compared with the usual endovascular implantation of kissing stents.
DATA: With regard to the primary patency rate, open surgical treatment remains superior to both endovascular procedures; however, the CERAB technique shows a better 5‑year outcome than the kissing stent technique. No differences are found in the secondary patency rate for any of the three procedures. The morbidity and mortality of the CERAB and kissing stent techniques are comparably low, and both procedures are superior to open surgical treatment.
CONCLUSION: Because of the better long-term outcome of the CERAB versus the kissing stent technique, it should be used in patients with complex aortoiliac stenoses with increased risk of complications expected with open surgical treatment.
