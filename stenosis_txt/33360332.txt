Title: Brachial artery thrombosis following bee sting, case report.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Bee stings are the most common among insect emergencies.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: We present a 47-year-old male patient who was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of pallor, chills, numbness and bruising on the left palm one hour after a bee sting on his left leg, and a very rare case of brachial artery stenosis in Dopler ultrasonography.
DISCUSSION: Often bee stings occur only with local allergic reactions; sometimes it can also cause myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, bleeding, hemolytic anemia, and kidney disease and neurological manifestations. Side effects are generally thought to be related to the dose of this venom in these patients who are admitted to the emergency room with a bruise extending from the left hand to the arm after bee bites.
CONCLUSION: With this case presented, we wanted to emphasize that thrombosis may occur due to bee stings, albeit rarely, and doctors in emergency departments should recognize these very rare cases.
