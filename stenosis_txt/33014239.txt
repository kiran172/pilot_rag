Title: Endoscopic meatotomy in the treatment of ureterocele: results in adult patients.

Abstract: To evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic meatotomy in the treatment of ureterocele in adults. A retrospective study of adult patients with ureterocele, treated between January 1987 and December 2014. In 47 patients, 55 intravesical ureteroceles were diagnosed and classified as 18 right, 21 left and eight bilateral (38%, 44% and 17% respectively). According to the Bruézière classification, 41 (75%) ureteroceles were type A and 14 (25%) others were type C. These ureteroceles were complicated by calculus formation in 22 cases, moderately dilated excretory pathways in 16 cases and both complications in a total of 9 cases. Four patients had a complicated ureterocele with pyelonephritis, one of which was emphysematous. The endoscopic treatment was performed in cases of complicated and/or symptomatic ureteroceles. Fifty one cases were treated by a "smiling mouth" meatotomy consisting in a transverse horizontal incision, with the treatment of any associated complication. The mean operative time was 35 minutes (10-90). The operative follow-up was uneventful in 42 patients and complications occurred in 5 patients (2 urinary retentions, 2 infectious complications and one hematuria). The mean duration of postoperative stay was 1-2 days. The mean follow-up was 15 months. Four patients developed vesicoureteral reflux and no stenosis was noted. The endoscopic incision of the ureteroceles seems today, after reviewing the results, to be a good treatment of adult ureterocele. It is a simple, minimally invasive and has a low morbidity rate.
