Title: Sleep architecture of short sleep time in patients with obstructive sleep apnea: a retrospective single-facility study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Sleep architecture consists of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and non-REM sleep time. Non-REM sleep time is further classified into three stages by depth (stage N1-N3). Some studies have reported that short sleep time predicts all-cause mortality. Short sleep time can have characteristics of sleep architecture which contribute to poor prognosis. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a disease which causes cessation or decline of ventilation during sleep due to upper airway stenosis and affects sleep architecture. Few studies have reported on the sleep architecture of short sleep time in patients with OSA. Therefore, we aimed to observe this phenomenon.
METHODS: From May 2008 to September 2021, patients diagnosed with OSA at our facility were assessed for clinical history and underwent full-night polysomnography (PSG). These patients were classified into two groups: total sleep time (TST) recorded on PSG consisting of a short TST (< 7 h) group and a not short TST (≥ 7 h) group.
RESULTS: Of 266 patients with OSA, compared to the not short TST group (n = 131), the short TST group (n = 135) had a lower REM sleep time (%) and a higher stage N1 sleep time (%). There was a significant difference in age between the two groups, so sub-analyses classified the patients by age: non-elderly patients (< 65 years) and elderly patients (≥ 65 years) to adjust for age. Both sub-analyses showed similar results to the analysis for the combined ages regarding sleep architecture.
CONCLUSION: Patients with OSA who had short sleep time had disordered sleep architecture with a lower REM sleep time (%) and more stage N1 sleep time.
