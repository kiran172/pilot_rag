Title: Coronary artery compression by pulmonary artery stenting after arterial switch operation: a novel indication for coronary compression test.

Abstract: Pulmonary artery stenosis is one of the most common complications after arterial switch operation. Stent implantation is an effective treatment with some risks related to coronary artery compression. We present the case of a patient affected by pulmonary stenosis after arterial switch operation. Coronary compression testing demonstrated compression of the left coronary artery from the balloon inflated in the left pulmonary artery. We should systematically consider the use of coronary balloon testing before stent implantation in patients with a history of switch operation.
