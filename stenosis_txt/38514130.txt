Title: [Carotid Artery Stenting].

Abstract: Currently, stricter indications for carotid artery stenosis are required owing to improvements in multifaceted medical treatment, including the intensive management of risk factors for atherosclerosis and lifestyle changes. High-risk factors for carotid artery stenting, such as vulnerable plaques, severe calcification, pseudo-occlusion, and difficult access, should be evaluated before endovascular intervention. Therefore, we need to understand the characteristics of each device to achieve maximum risk reduction for carotid artery stenting.
