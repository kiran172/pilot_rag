Title: Association Between Cumulative Exposure to Increased Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and the Prevalence of Asymptomatic Intracranial Atherosclerotic Stenosis.

Abstract: Background and Purpose: Intracranial atherosclerosis has gained increasing attention due to the high risk of recurrent clinical or subclinical ischemic events, while the relationship between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measured at a single time point and intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is inconsistent. This study aims to assess the association between cumulative exposure to increased LDL-C and the prevalence of asymptomatic ICAS. Methods: The Asymptomatic Polyvascular Abnormalities Community study was investigated on the epidemiology of asymptomatic polyvascular abnormalities in Chinese adults. In this study, we included 4,523 participants with LDL-C measured at 3 examinations in 2006, 2008, and 2010. Cumulative exposure to increased LDL-C was calculated as following: LDL-C burden<sub>2006-2008</sub> = [(LDL-C<sub>2006</sub>-1.8) + (LDL-C<sub>2008</sub>-1.8)]/2 * time<sub>2006-2008</sub>; LDL-C burden = LDL-C burden<sub>2006-2008</sub> + LDL-C burden<sub>2008-2010</sub>. Transcranial doppler ultrasonography was performed in 2010 to detecting the ICAS. Results: Of the 4,347 patients, 13.3% (580/4,347) were diagnosed with ICAS. In univariate analysis, the association between LDL-C burden and ICAS prevalence was significant, the odds ratios (95% confidence interval) from the lowest to the highest quartile were 1 (reference), 1.30 (0.99-1.70), 1.32 (1.01-1.73), and 2.14 (1.66-2.75), respectively (P &lt; 0.05). After adjustment for potential confounding factors, the same result was reached. Conclusions: Cumulative exposure to increased LDL-C is concentration-dependently associated with increased prevalence of asymptomatic ICAS, especially in those under the age of 65 y or free of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia.
