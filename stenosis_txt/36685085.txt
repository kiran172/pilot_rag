Title: Diagnosis and Management of Postoperative Complications After Sleeve Gastrectomy.

Abstract: Sleeve gastrectomy (SG) has demonstrated excellent outcomes in terms of weight loss and resolution of obesity-related comorbidities as a single procedure. It has gained rapidly increasing popularity among bariatric surgeons and patients over the last two decades. This is due to its relative ease of use and less frequent morbidities related to the procedure. Even though the overall complication rate after SG is reported to be lower than conventional Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or biliopancreatic diversion, it still affects 1-10% of the patients undergoing SG, which is not negligible. Early postoperative complications that can occur within 30 days after SG include hemorrhage, leakage, sleeve stenosis, and reflux. Thromboembolic events are rare but can occur after surgery. Here, we review the incidence, diagnosis, and management of these early postoperative complications.
