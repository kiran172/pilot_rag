Title: Management of arterial dissections in 12 patients during transarterial chemoembolization and yttrium-90 selective internal radiotherapy for primary and secondary liver tumours.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe rates and management strategies of arterial dissections in transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) and Yttrium-90 selective internal radiotherapy (90Y SIRT) for primary and secondary liver tumours.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective review included 1377 hepatic angiographies between May 2010 and June 2015 in a single centre for TACE and 90Y SIRT of liver tumours. The angiogram results, management, treatment outcomes and follow-up angiography/imaging findings were recorded.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Twelve cases of arterial dissections (12/1377, 0.87%) were documented. Three dissections (3/633, 0.47%) occurred during TACE, seven (7/449, 1.56%) during pre-treatment planning angiographies (PTPA) for 90Y SIRT, and two (2/249, 0.80%) during the treatment procedure of 90Y SIRT. The preferred management strategy was to manoeuvre past the dissection and complete the procedure, which was achieved in six patients (50%). Angioplasty with stenting was performed in one patient. In three patients, the procedure was held off for up to 3 months to allow the dissection to heal before repeating the procedure. A dissection that occurred during PTPA was detected only when the patient returned for 90Y SIRT. PTPA was immediately repeated for this patient. The last patient opted for sorafenib. Residual 50% stenosis was seen in one patient on follow-up hepatic angiography, but he was otherwise asymptomatic. In the remaining patients, no residual dissection or clinical sequelae was observed on follow-up.
CONCLUSION: Arterial dissection is a rare but important complication of transarterial locoregional therapy. Where possible, attempts should be made at completing the therapy. Deferring treatment can be considered as dissections usually heal within 3 months.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4, case series.
