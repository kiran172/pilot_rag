Title: Prognostic Impact of Renal Function on 5-Year Outcomes After Fractional Flow Reserve-Guided Deferral of Revascularization.

Abstract: Background Chronic kidney disease (CKD) might influence fractional flow reserve (FFR) value, potentially attenuating its prognostic utility. However, few large-scale data are available regarding clinical outcomes after FFR-guided deferral of revascularization in patients with CKD. Methods and Results From the J-CONFIRM registry (Long-Term Outcomes of Japanese Patients With Deferral of Coronary Intervention Based on Fractional Flow Reserve in Multicenter Registry), 1218 patients were divided into 3 groups according to renal function: (1) non-CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate ≥60 mL/min per 1.73 m2), n=385; (2) CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate 15-59 mL/min per 1.73 m2, n=763); and (3) end-stage renal disease (ESRD) (eGFR &lt;15 mL/min per 1.73 m2, n=70). The primary study end point was the cumulative 5-year incidence of target vessel failure (TVF), defined as a composite of cardiac death, target vessel myocardial infarction, and clinical driven target vessel revascularization. Cumulative 5-year incidence of TVF was significantly higher in the ESRD group than in the CKD and non-CKD group, whereas it did not differ between the CKD and non-CKD groups (26.3% versus 11.9% versus 9.5%, P&lt;0.001). Although the 5-year TVF risk increased as the FFR value decreased regardless of renal function, patients with ESRD had a remarkably higher risk of TVF at every FFR value than those with CKD and non-CKD. Conclusions At 5 years, patients with ESRD showed a higher incidence of TVF than patients with CKD and non-CKD, although with similar outcomes between patients with CKD and non-CKD. Patients with ESRD had an excess risk of 5-year TVF at every FFR value compared with those with CKD and non-CKD. Registration URL: https://www.umin.ac.jp; Unique identifier: UMIN000014473.
