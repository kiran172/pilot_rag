Title: Successful excision of a giant subcarinal bronchogenic cyst by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.

Abstract: Mediastinal bronchogenic cysts, regarded as congenital foregut abnormalities, are uncommon. These cysts can compress adjacent structures, causing obstructive symptoms and complications. A 57-year-old man was admitted to our hospital with complaints of tachycardia, dyspnea, and chest pain. Enhanced computed tomography revealed a 90 × 90 mm, well-defined subcarinal cystic mass causing significant compression and stenosis of the right main bronchus, right pulmonary artery, and right inferior pulmonary vein. The mass was successfully excised using one window and two-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery with partial resection and repair of pulmonary artery, and the postoperative course was good with no recurrence.
