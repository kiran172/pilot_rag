Title: Results of endovascular interventions for peripheral arterial diseases on the targeted arterial segments.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Endovascular interventions (EVIs) are an effective and minimally invasive therapeutic option for peripheral arterial diseases (PADs). This study aimed to evaluate the results of EVIs for PADs on the targeted arterial segments (TASs).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: One hundred and sixteen (116) participants with PADs were included in this cohort study. The diagnosis of PAD in this study was based on the ankle-brachial index (ABI) and Rutherford classification, confirmed by Duplex ultrasound and computed tomography angiography (CTA). The targeted arterial segments (TASs) were treated using either balloon angioplasty or endovascular stenting. At the end of each EVI, a post-procedure angiography was performed to evaluate the EVIs' results (i.e., balloon angioplasty and endovascular stenting) for PADs on the TASs. The results of EVIs were classified as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory. Satisfactory if the TASs were recanalized or had <30% stenosis after the EVIs. Unsatisfactory if the TASs were still occluded or had >30% stenosis after the EVIs.
RESULTS: The mean participants' age was 54.42Â±7.74 years; 35.3% of them were diabetic, 36.2% were hypertensive, and 28.5% had multiple medical disorders. Based on Rutherford classification, 44.83% of the participants had grade I, category 2 chronic ischemia, 23.28% had grade I, category 3 chronic ischemia, 12.93% had grade II, category 4 chronic ischemia, and 18.96% had grade III, category 5 chronic ischemia. About 87.1% of the participants' PADs were managed using balloon angioplasty. The affected arteries were the superficial femoral arteries in 47.5%, popliteal arteries in 18.8%, posterior tibial arteries in 18.8%, and anterior tibial arteries in 14.9%. About 12.9% of the participants' PADs were managed using endovascular stenting and the affected arteries were the common iliac arteries in 60%, and external iliac arteries in 40%. The results of EVIs were satisfactory in 98.28% of the participants, while it was unsatisfactory in 1.72% of them.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular interventions in this study were an effective and minimally invasive therapeutic option for PADs, with satisfactory results in 98.28%. Further studies, including the long-term and clinical outcomes after EVIs for PADs, are required.
