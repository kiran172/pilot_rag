Title: Double-root transfer and the half-turned truncal switch.

Abstract: Transposition of great arteries (TGA) or double-outlet right ventricle (DORV) with ventricular septal defect (VSD) and pulmonary stenosis (PS) is a complex congenital cardiac malformation, which can be treated by both univentricular and biventricular pathways. Biventricular repair includes Rastelli operation, reparation a l'etage ventriculaire (REV), pulmonary root translocation, and Nikaidoh procedures. Double-root translocation (DRT) technique and half-turned truncal switch technique (HTTS) are being considered as useful alternatives. In this review, we will see in detail about DRT and HTTS.
