Title: "Pediatric Spontaneous Intracranial Dissecting Aneurysms: Impact of Ischemic and Hemorrhagic Manifestations on Endovascular Treatment Strategies - Insights from a Developing World Setting".

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Pediatric spontaneous intracranial dissecting aneurysms are rare, but systematic studies comparing hemorrhagic and ischemic presentations are lacking. This study addresses gaps in understanding their epidemiology, clinical presentation, management, and outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 23 pediatric patients with nontraumatic intracranial dissecting aneurysms treated between July 2018 and December 2023 was conducted. Patients were divided into 2 groups based on presentation: hemorrhagic (n = 16) and ischemic (n = 7). Clinical data were analyzed, including demographics, radiologic findings, treatment modalities, and outcomes.
RESULTS: Clinical presentations varied, with limb weakness being more prevalent in hemorrhagic cases (P = 0.014), while headache and seizures were more common in ischemic cases. Angiographic analysis revealed distinct patterns, with hemorrhagic cases showing more distal involvement on vessel segments with stenosis and dilatation (pearl string sign). At the same time, the ischemic group exhibited the double-lumen sign. Various treatments, including microsurgery and endovascular techniques, were utilized, with perioperative complications observed, including one mortality in a hemorrhagic case. Multiple regression analysis identified significant risk factors for perioperative complications, namely, the configuration of the dissecting aneurysm (P = 0.016) and the type of presentation (P = 0.0006). Long-term Glasgow Outcome Scores were comparable, but patients with hemorrhagic manifestations experienced prolonged hospital and ICU stays (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Pediatric intracranial dissecting aneurysms, particularly hemorrhagic cases, are associated with severe neurologic deficits and higher perioperative complications. Despite similar long-term outcomes, hemorrhagic cases require prolonged hospitalization, increasing treatment costs. Optimizing management strategies for pediatric intracranial dissecting aneurysms, especially those with hemorrhagic features, is essential to improve outcomes and reduce healthcare expenditures.
