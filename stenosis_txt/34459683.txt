Title: The role of noninvasive imaging in the diagnostic workup for pulsatile tinnitus.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the diagnostic yield of advanced noninvasive imaging in the evaluation of patients with pulsatile tinnitus.
BACKGROUND: Pulsatile tinnitus can be caused by high-risk cerebrovascular pathologies such as arteriovenous fistulae. The role of advanced noninvasive imaging, including magnetic resonance angiography and magnetic resonance venography, in the diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus is not well defined.
DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients presenting for outpatient diagnostic evaluation of pulsatile tinnitus from January 2018 to March 2020 at Weill Cornell Medicine. Patients with non-pulsatile tinnitus and established etiologic diagnoses were excluded. Systematic chart abstraction was summarized using standard descriptive statistics. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with nondiagnostic noninvasive imaging.
RESULTS: A total of 187 patients (139 (74.3%) women) took part in this study, with a mean age of 48.6 years (standard deviation (SD) = 15.5 years) and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 26.9 kg/m2 (SD = 6.1 kg/m2). Of the 187 patients, 121 (64.7%) underwent exclusively noninvasive imaging, and 66 (35.3%) patients also had digital subtraction angiography (DSA). In patients who had exclusively noninvasive imaging, 62 (51.2%) patients received a diagnosis. In patients who underwent noninvasive and DSA imaging, 14 (21.2%) patients received a diagnosis based on DSA. Patients who were older at symptom onset (odds ratio (OR) = 1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.01-1.09) and those with a lower BMI (OR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.77-0.98) were more likely to have nondiagnostic noninvasive imaging.
CONCLUSION: Noninvasive cerebrovascular imaging often uncovers the etiology of pulsatile tinnitus. DSA remains useful for additional evaluation for patients with specific associated features.
