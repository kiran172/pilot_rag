Title: Recurrent flash pulmonary edema in unilateral renal artery stenosis with contralateral kidney shrinkage: A case report.

Abstract: RATIONALE: Flash pulmonary edema is a critical medical condition characterized by sudden and severe fluid accumulation in the lungs, which poses an immediate and life-threatening emergency. This can arise from a variety of underlying causes. This manuscript presents a case of recurrent pulmonary edema that was successfully managed through the insertion of a renal artery stent.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 78-year-old woman visited the emergency room with recurrent acute dyspnea. Computed tomography renal angiography revealed renal artery stenosis of a single-functioning kidney.
DIAGNOSES: Flash pulmonary edema caused by renal artery stenosis of a functioning single kidney.
INTERVENTIONS: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting were performed for the renal artery stenosis.
OUTCOMES: The patient's kidney function rapidly improved, and she has been free of flash pulmonary edema for 2 years.
LESSONS: Flash pulmonary edema can have various causes and can immediately be a life-threatening emergency. However, it can be treated with percutaneous revascularization if it is caused by renal artery stenosis. This case report reinforces the importance of accurate and immediate diagnosis when dealing with flash pulmonary edema. This case emphasizes the potential therapeutic benefit of renal artery stenting in the management of flash pulmonary edema caused by renal artery stenosis in patients with a single-functioning kidney.
