Title: Long-term outcomes of large balloon dilatation for benign anastomotic stricture following surgical resection of esophageal cancer.

Abstract: Surgical resection of esophageal cancer may result in benign anastomotic strictures, which are usually treated by balloon dilatation. Here we reported the long-term outcomes of large balloon dilatation for benign anastomotic strictures secondary to esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. From February 2011 to December 2016, 27 esophageal cancer patients underwent large balloon dilatation for benign strictures following surgical resection. Clinical success rate, number of dilatation sessions, complication rate, and mortality rate were evaluated. A total of 27 patients developed a benign stricture at the esophagectomy site. A total of 50 dilatation sessions of large balloon were performed, with a mean of 1.8 sessions per patients (range 1.0-5.0). Only 1 perforation was observed (2.0% per dilatation session), and required no surgery. No procedure-related deaths were recorded. Large balloon dilation was technically successful in the remained 26 patients (96.3%). Dysphagia score and stricture index decreased significantly (P < .0001). Proximal diameter of stricture, stricture diameter and length decreased significantly. Patients were followed up for 36.3 ± 7.1 months, and 14 patients survived without dysphagia. The survival rates were 95.0%, 69.1%, 34.5% for 1, 5, and 9 years, respectively. The median survival was 96.0 months. Large balloon dilatation can be a safe and feasible treatment for benign anastomic strictures following surgical resection of esophageal cancer, with a low perforation rate. However, further study compared with small balloon dilatation is warranted.
