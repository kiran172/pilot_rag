Title: A Simple Predictor for Long-Term Mortality After Percutaneous Iliac Artery Intervention: Systemic Immune Inflammatory Index.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peripheral arterial disease is a common disease all over the world. Medical treatment, percutaneous invasive treatment, and operation are the considerable options. Percutaneous treatment is a valid option with a higher patency rate. Systemic immune-inflammatory index (SII) is a formula which is calculated as neutrophil count to platelet count divided into lymphocyte count. This formula demonstrates the active inflammatory state. In our study, we aimed to demonstrate the relationship with SII and the mortality, major cardiovascular events, and success rates of percutaneous treatment of iliac artery disease.
METHODS: A total of 600 patients underwent percutaneous intervention due to iliac artery disease were enrolled. The primary end point was mortality and the secondary end points were in-hospital thrombosis, restenosis, residual stenosis, and postintervention complications. The best cut-off value of SII to predict mortality was determined and the patients were divided into 2 groups, as those with higher SII values (1,073.782 <) and as those with lower SII values (1,073.782 >). Each group was evaluated in terms of clinical, laboratory, and technical aspects.
RESULTS: After exclusion criteria were applied, 417 patients were enrolled into the study. Patients with high SII values had higher rates of in-hospital thrombosis [0 (0%); 3 (2.2%), P = 0.037] and mortality [38 (13.7%); 46 (33.1%), P < 0.001]. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, chronic kidney disease [odds ratio: 4.104, 95 0.5 confidence interval: 2.250-7.487, P < 0.001] and SII [odds ratio: 3.346, 95 0.5 confidence interval: 1.982-5.649, P < 0.001] were found to be independent risk factors for mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: SII is a relatively new, simple, and effective mortality risk predictor in patients with iliac artery disease who underwent percutaneous intervention. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study which uses SII to predict mortality in such patient group.
