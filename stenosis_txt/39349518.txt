Title: Management of adult focal nasolacrimal duct stenosis: long-term outcomes of 3D CT-DCG-assisted and endoscopically guided coronary catheter balloon dacryoplasty.

Abstract: The purpose was to evaluate the use of 3D CT-DCG-assisted and endoscopically guided coronary catheter balloon dacryoplasty (CC-BDCP) in adults with focal stenosis of the nasolacrimal duct (NLD) and report their long-term outcomes. A prospective, non-randomized, single-center clinical study was performed, and the patients underwent endoscopy-guided CC-BDCP using percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) balloon catheters. 25 patients were enrolled in the study. The CC-BDCP procedure was performed in 21 of 25 (84%) patients, and the remaining 4 (16%) patients had significant procedural difficulties due to unfavorable anatomical conditions. Of the 21 patients, 10 (47.6%) were procedurally assessed as "easy" (eCC-BDCP) and in 11 (52.4%) as procedurally "difficult" (dCC-BDCP). Values on Munk's epiphora intensity scale changed overall from 4.0 preoperatively to 1.4 ± 1.6 (p = 0.00001) postoperatively overall. FDDT changed overall from 2.9 ± 0.3 to 1.1 ± 1.2 after treatment (p = 0.00008) (from 2.8 ± 0.4 to 0.3 ± 0.6 in the eCC-BDCP group and from 2.9 ± 0.3 to 1.4 ± 1.2 in the dCC-BDCP group (p = 0.01352). The anatomical and functional success rate was 77% overall, 90% in the eCC-BDCP group, and 64% in the dCC-BDCP group. The CC-BDCP led to a statistically significant decrease in epiphora in a particular group of adult patients with demonstrable focal stenosis of the NLD.
