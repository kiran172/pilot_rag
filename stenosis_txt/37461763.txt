Title: Swimming With Sharks: Left Main Coronary Obstruction Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Delayed coronary obstruction (DCO) occurs when there is obstruction of the coronary ostia following a transcatheter aortic valvular implantation (TAVI). It is an uncommon but serious complication that often leads to death, usually presents as severe hypotension after TAVI, and should be suspected if migration of the valve occurs. We report the case of a 70-year-old female patient with severe aortic stenosisÂ who underwent TAVI using a 26-mm CoreValve Evolut Pro (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland). Although the valve was implanted successfully, she experienced hypotension with intermittent ST elevations and had a cardiac arrest shortly after, requiring Advanced Cardiovascular Life Support (ACLS). An aortogram showed sealing of the sinotubular junction (STJ) by CoreValve, without coronary flow. CoreValve was then snared and repositioned in the ascending aorta recovering coronary flow and cardiac pulsatility. A second TAVI was performed and an Edwards 20 mm Sapiens 3 valve (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA) was implanted as standard procedure.
