Title: A case of cervical schwannoma with upper tracheal stenosis followed up as asthma for 4 years.

Abstract: Cases of upper tracheal stenosis due to cervical schwannoma are fairly rare; therefore, no treatment has been determined. In this case, our patient had been treated for asthma for 4 years and was admitted to our hospital because of exacerbation. Computed tomography showed a tracheal stenosis lesion just below the vocal cords, and a biopsy revealed schwannoma. Conservative therapy was preferred rather than tumour resection by surgery. Follow-up for 5 years showed no changes on imaging. Conservative treatment is considered as an option if the extratracheal tumour does not grow.
