Title: A comparison of computed tomography imaging with histopathology in the sensitivity and correlation of evaluating coronary arterial calcification.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The sensitivity and correlation of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) as compared with histopathology are unknown in evaluating coronary arterial calcification. In this study, we retrospectively evaluated qualitatively and quantitatively the sensitivity and correlation of coronary CTA compared with histopathology in assessing coronary arterial calcification.
METHODS: This study was conducted on 12 randomly selected cadavers aged over 40 years at the time of death, and 53 segments of coronary arteries from these 12 cadavers were obtained from the Human Anatomy Laboratory of Tianjin Medical University. The artery segments were scanned using contrasted-enhanced dual-source computed tomography (DSCT) with an axial slice thickness of 0.6 mm. Coronary artery calcification in a coronary segment was defined as the presence of 1 or more voxels with a CT density >130 Hounsfield units. According to the arc of calcification in the cross section of the coronary artery wall, calcified plaques were divided into three categories: mild, moderate, and severe calcification. The coronary artery stenosis caused by calcified plaque was observed and calculated with multiplanar reconstruction (MPR), maximum density projection, volume rendering (VR), and cross-sectional reconstruction. After CT enhancement scanning, the coronary artery specimens were cut into 4-mm long segments and embedded in paraffin for pathological staining. Pathological classification and coronary artery stenosis measured with pathological analysis were used as comparison criteria.
RESULTS: Histopathology detected 69 Vb-type plaques, while DSCT detected 57 calcified plaques. The sensitivity of CT for detecting mild, moderate, and severe calcified plaques were 88.3% [95% confidence interval (CI): 74.1-95.6%], 100% (95% CI: 69.8-100%), and 100% (95% CI: 73.2-100%), respectively. DSCT had a significant (P&lt;0.001) correlation with histopathology in quantifying coronary artery stenosis caused by mild, moderate, and severe calcified plaques (R2=0.9278, R2=0.9158, R2=0.7923, respectively). Compared with histopathology, DSCT overestimated coronary artery stenosis caused by mild, moderate, and severe calcified plaques (3.2%±2.0%, 4.9%±4.7%, and 14.7%±8.2%, respectively; P&lt;0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: DSCT contrast enhancement scanning can detect and characterize coronary artery calcification with a good correlation with histopathologic quantification of coronary artery stenosis caused by different types of calcified plaques, even though coronary CTA may overestimate the stenosis.
