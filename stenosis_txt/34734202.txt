Title: Improvement of evaluation in Chinese patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease using the very-high-risk refinement: a population-based study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Continuous refinement of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) stratification has raised the definition of very-high-risk (VHR) recently, which has been underutilized in China. We aimed to identify patients at VHR and evaluate their performances in a Chinese population.
METHODS: A total of 9944 patients with ASCVD was continuously enrolled. Patients at VHR was identified according to 2018 AHA/ACC guideline. Median follow-up was 36.4 months. Clinical characteristics, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) achievements, and the prognostic value of VHR mapping for cardiovascular events (CVEs) were evaluated.
FINDINGS: Overall, 26% (2542/9944) of patients were deemed as VHR, which were subsequently divided into two subgroups of VHR-1 [31% (779/2542)] and VHR-2 [69% (1763/2542)]. The rates of VHR were higher among patients of male (30%,2157/7268), young with age &lt;45 years (46%,518/1130), and low-income regions (27%, 498/1838). Patients at VHR carried higher rates of risk factors than those at non-VHR (all p&lt;0.001). However, only 3% (80/2542) of patients at VHR were prescribed with high-intensity of statins, and just 13% (321/2542) of them reached the LDL-C goal (&lt;1.4mmol/L). Furthermore, of patients with coronary stenosis (n=9806), multiple-diseased vessels (47%, 1192/2523 vs. 36%,2587/7283) and occlusive lesions (36%, 902/2523 vs. 13%, 949/7283) were detected more commonly in those at VHR than non-VHR. The adjusted hazard ratios of VHR-1 and VHR-2 for primary CVEs were 2.58(1.61-4.14) and 2.23(1.55-3.20), respectively.
INTERPRETATION: Our study firstly reported that patients at VHR carried more severe ASCVD burden, lower LDL-C achievement, and higher CVEs risk, suggesting that the refinement of ASCVD might be considered in China to further understand patients at VHR.
