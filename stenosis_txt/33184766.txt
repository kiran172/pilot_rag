Title: Coronary Artery Disease in Patients with HIV Infection: An Update.

Abstract: Premature cardiovascular disease among the HIV-infected population is of great concern among clinicians. The increased life expectancy of HIV-infected individuals is mainly due to the early detection of infection and the advent of antiretroviral therapy. Once known as a deadly disease, HIV infection has transitioned into a chronic condition. Cardiovascular disease in this population is thought to progress early due to traditional and non-traditional risk factors. Early detection of subclinical atherosclerosis has become a center of focus in research as our complete understanding of this process it not yet well known. Advancements in cardiac computed tomography angiography has enabled the exploration of coronary artery disease by further evaluation of coronary stenosis and plaque analysis. An increase in cardiovascular event rates in this population is currently thought to be linked to antiretroviral therapy, Framingham risk factors, and HIV. We sought to present an updated comprehensive review of the available literature on HIV related to atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk.
