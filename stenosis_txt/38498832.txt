Title: Frequency and characteristics of severe relapse in giant cell arteritis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequency and characteristics of severe relapse in patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) in a real-life setting.
METHODS: In a monocentric database of 530 patients, we retrospectively analysed patients who experienced at least one relapse and distinguished severe from nonsevere relapses. Severe relapse was defined by the occurrence of an ischaemic event (ophthalmologic, neurologic, digestive, limb ischaemia), the occurrence of an aortic complication (i.e. new or worsening of aortic dilation, aortic dissection), or new or worsening of vascular stenosis.
RESULTS: From the cohort of 530 patients, 242 (45.7%) patients experienced relapse at least once, including 13 (2.5% of the cohort) who experienced severe relapse. Among the 464 recorded relapses, 14 (3% of all relapses) were severe. Severe relapse corresponded to the following vascular events: a peripheral limb ischaemia in 6 patients, a visual event in 3 patients (including 2 acute anterior ischaemic anterior neuropathies), an aortic complication in 3 patients, a mesenteric ischaemia in one patient and an ischaemic stroke in one patient.When compared with the 229 patients who experienced nonsevere relapses, severe relapse patients were younger at diagnosis (p= 0.02), more frequently showed limb claudication at baseline (p< 0.0001) and fewer GCA-related cranial signs (p< 0.0001). At diagnosis, more large-vessel vasculitis on imaging (82% vs 36%, p= 0.002) were observed in patients with severe relapse. The death rate did not differ between patients with severe and nonsevere relapses.
CONCLUSION: In a real-life setting, relapse affects nearly half of GCA patients, but severe relapse is rare.
