Title: Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy Associated With Influenza A and a Ground-Level Fall.

Abstract: Our case involves a 92-year-old female who presented to the emergency department due to a ground-level fall and difficulty breathing. She was found to have influenza A, elevated troponin, and decreased left ventricular ejection fraction. However, cardiac catheterization did not reveal any coronary artery stenosis, supporting a diagnosis of takotsubo cardiomyopathy (TC). The patient's ejection fraction was normal after nine months. This case highlights the importance of considering TC in elderly female patients who have reduced ejection fraction and elevated troponin in the setting of infection and a recent fall.
