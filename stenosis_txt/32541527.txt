Title: Microendoscopic discectomy versus minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis without spondylolisthesis.

Abstract: Micoendoscopic discectomy (MED) and minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MIS-TLIF) has become alternatives of the traditional open decompression surgery alone and decompression plus fusion surgery in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS). To date, there is no study focusing on the comparison of clinical outcomes after MED and MIS-TLIF for LSS without spondylolisthesis.Four hundred ninety-seven patients who underwent MED (236 cases) or MIS-TLIF (261 cases) for LSS without spondylolisthesis were included in this study. Perioperative outcomes (hospital stay, operation time and blood loss), cost, functional scores (Oswestry Disability Index, 12-item short form health survey) with a 24-month follow-up visit, complication and reoperation condition within 24 months after surgery were recorded and assessed.No significant difference of clinical outcomes over time was observed between these 2 surgical approaches. Compared with MIS-TLIF, MED was associated with greater satisfaction at 1-month time point postoperatively, whereas this effect was equalized at 3-month time point postoperatively. MED brought advantages in shorter hospital stay, shorter operation time, less blood loss, and less cost over MIS-TLIF.There was no significant difference in 24-month function scores over time between MED group and MIS-TLIF group. Compared with MIS-TLIF, MED could result in a better perioperative effect and less cost.
