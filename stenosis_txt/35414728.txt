Title: Long-term results of oversized balloon dilation for benign anastomotic biliary strictures: initial two-center experience.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe, assess the feasibility of, and quantify the long-term patency achieved with percutaneous transhepatic biliary dilation using the anastomotic biliary stricture (ABS) oversized balloon dilation technique as a single-step procedure for the treatment of benign anastomotic biliary strictures following hepatobiliary surgery.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective, two-center study including 16 consecutive cases of symptomatic benign biliary-enteric strictures. After assessment of the diameter of the bile duct by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, the strictures were dilated with oversized balloons (40-50% larger than the bile duct diameter) and an external biliary-enteric drain was placed. After drain removal, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results were evaluated every three months, whereas follow-up magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 30 days out and follow-up computed tomography was performed at 6 and 12 months out.
RESULTS: The mean follow-up time was 31.8 Â± 8.15 months. Kaplan-Meier-estimated 1-, 2-, and 3-year patency rates were 88.2%, 82.4%, and 82.4%, respectively. There was one major complication-a small dehiscence of the anastomosis-which extended the catheter dwell time. Minor complications occurred in two cases-one small perihepatic hematoma and one segmental thrombosis of the left portal branch-neither of which required further intervention.
CONCLUSION: The single-step ABS oversized balloon dilation technique is a feasible treatment for benign anastomotic biliary-enteric strictures. The technique appears to be associated with high rates of long-term clinical success and patency.
