Title: Twenty-Four-Month Efficacy of Ureteroureterostomy Combined With Unilateral Nephrostomy Following Radical Cystectomy.

Abstract: Introduction The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 24-month outcomes of ureteroureterostomy combined with unilateral nephrostomy following radical cystectomy in patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (BC). Materials and methods This single-center study with prospectively collected data with retrospective data analysis was carried out between December 2018 and November 2021 and enrolled 36 patients, who underwent radical cystectomy combined with ureteroureterostomy and unilateral nephrostomy. Regular renal function assessment was carried out using serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and postoperative complications, endoscopic, ultrasound, and other radiological study findings were evaluated. The follow-up of the patients was carried out over a period of 24 months. Results After completion of the 24-month follow-up, the renal function proved to be slightly improved (mean serum creatinine and eGFR values of 1.38±0.72 mg/dL and 55.9±21.87 mL/min) compared to the first-year results (1.41±0.54 mg/dL and 52.10±19.64 mL/min). However, this improvement is statistically not significant (p=0.44, p=0.30). The 24-month follow-up imaging findings remained stable in 97.22% of patients compared to the first-year results, with preservation of bilateral ureteric dilatation and grade 1 dilatation of the non-drained kidney. No case of acute pyelonephritis was recorded after the completion of the second year of follow-up, in comparison to the eight patients (22.22%) of the 12-month follow-up, who suffered acute pyelonephritis. After completing of the 24-month follow-up, one patient was excluded from further analysis, due to the placement of a second permanent percutaneous nephrostomy in the non-drained kidney, due to ureteroureterostomy stenosis with consecutive hydronephrosis in the contralateral kidney and acute renal failure. No case of anastomotic leak was observed. Conclusions The function of the ureteroureterostomy combined with unilateral nephrostomy is proven to be a safe method of urinary diversion (UD) at 24 months, with minimal and easily manageable complications. Only one case of stenosis of the ureteroureterostomy with consecutive acute renal failure due to hydronephrosis in the non-drained kidney was observed. The renal function remained stable.
