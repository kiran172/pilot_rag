Title: Associations between medical therapy after surgical aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis and long-term mortality: a report from the SWEDEHEART registry.

Abstract: AIMS: The association between the use of statins, renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, and/or β-blockers and long-term mortality in patients with aortic stenosis (AS) who underwent surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) is unknown.
METHODS AND RESULTS: All patients with AS who underwent isolated first-time SAVR in Sweden from 2006 to 2017 and survived 6 months after discharge were included. Individual patient data from four mandatory nationwide registries were merged. Cox proportional hazards models, with time-updated data on medication status and adjusted for age, sex, comorbidities, type of prosthesis, and year of surgery, were used to investigate associations between dispensed statins, RAS inhibitors, and β-blockers and all-cause mortality. In total, 9553 patients were included, and the median follow-up time was 4.9 years (range 0-11); 1738 patients (18.2%) died during follow-up. Statins were dispensed to 49.1% and 49.0% of the patients within 6 months of discharge from the hospital and after 10 years, respectively. Corresponding figures were 51.4% and 53.9% for RAS inhibitors and 79.3% and 60.7% for β-blockers. Ongoing treatment was associated with lower mortality risk for statins {adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.67 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.60-0.74]; P < 0.001} and RAS inhibitors [aHR 0.84 (0.76-0.93); P < 0.001] but not for β-blockers [aHR 1.17 (1.05-1.30); P = 0.004]. The associations were robust in subgroups based on age, sex, and comorbidities (P for interactions >0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this large population-based real-world study support the use of statins and RAS inhibitors for patients who underwent SAVR due to AS.
