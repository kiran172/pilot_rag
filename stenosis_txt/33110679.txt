Title: Epiphrenic Diverticulum in an Infant with Congenital Esophageal Stenosis Associated with Esophageal Atresia.

Abstract: Congenital esophageal stenosis (CES) is a rare congenital disorder which may be isolated or associated with esophageal atresia (EA). It courses with esophageal outflow tract obstruction. Esophageal epiphrenic diverticulae are esophageal outpouchings above diaphragm which develop because of an underlying esophageal motor disorder. We present an infant who had CES associated with EA detected during the course of routine follow-up. She underwent several sessions of esophageal balloon dilatations for CES with some symptomatic improvement. However, an epiphrenic diverticulum (ED) developed during the course of treatment which was detected by further investigations. A surgical excision was performed with a successful outcome. An ED developed secondary to CES has not been previously reported. We have highlighted the diagnostic modalities employed, treatment options, and clinical follow-up for these two rare conditions in children.
