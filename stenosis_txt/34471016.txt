Title: Successful Resection of a Primary Dedifferentiated Tracheal Liposarcoma Causing Tracheal Stenosis.

Abstract: A 68-year-old woman was admitted with a persistent cough and dyspnea that had persisted for 4 months prior. Chest computed tomography revealed a tumor protruding from the membranous portion of the trachea. She underwent tumor resection via rigid and flexible bronchoscopy to relieve the symptoms and obtain a diagnosis. After the procedure, she was diagnosed with tracheal liposarcoma. Three months after the procedure, she underwent complete surgical tumor resection. Liposarcoma is a mesenchymal tumor that usually develops in the extremities and the retroperitoneum. Tracheal liposarcoma is extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, this is only the second reported case.
