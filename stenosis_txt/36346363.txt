Title: The impact of early surgical treatment of tracheal stenosis on neurorehabilitation outcome in patients with severe acquired brain injury.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Acquired tracheal stenosis (TS) is a potentially life-threatening condition following prolonged intubation and/or tracheostomy in adult patients with severe Acquired Brain Injury (sABI), requiring a tracheal resection and reconstruction.
METHODS: We included 38 sABI adult patients with TS, admitted at a post-acute Neurorehabilitation Hospital. Disability Rating Scale (DRS) and other functional assessment measures were recorded at admission (t<sub>1</sub>), before TS surgical treatment (t<sub>2</sub>), and at discharge (t<sub>3</sub>). Patients were defined as 'improved' when they changed from a more severe to a less severe disability, between time t<sub>2</sub> and time t<sub>3</sub>, and as "not improved" when they did not show any further improvement between t<sub>2</sub> and t<sub>3</sub>, or they already exhibited a disability improvement since time interval t<sub>1</sub>-t<sub>2</sub>.
RESULTS: Time interval between the injury onset and TS surgical treatment (t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>0</sub>) was associated with the patient's disability improvement, suggesting the t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>0</sub> time interval ≤ 115 days as a cutoff value for a possible functional recovery. A t<sub>2</sub>-t<sub>0</sub> time interval ≤ 170 days is also associated to absence of persistent dysphagia.
CONCLUSIONS: Early TS surgical treatment within 115 days from the injury onset contributes to the improvement of the disability level in patients with sABI, optimizing their functional outcomes and recovery potential.
