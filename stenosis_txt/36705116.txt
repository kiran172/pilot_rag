Title: Nerve Root Sedimentation Sign among Lumbar Canal Stenosis Patients Visiting the Department of Orthopaedics in a Tertiary Care Centre: A Descriptive Cross-sectional Study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Lumbar canal stenosis is a common cause of back pain and neurogenic claudication in the elderly population. Nerve root sedimentation sign-on Magnetic resonance imaging is a novel sign proposed for the diagnosis of lumbar canal stenosis. There is limited research so far. So, the aim of this study was to find out the prevalence of nerve root sedimentation signs in lumbar canal stenosis among patients visiting the Department of Orthopaedics in a tertiary care centre.
METHODS: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted from 1 January 2020 to 31 July 2021 in the tertiary care centre, after receiving ethical approval from the Institutional ethical review board (Reference number: 299/(6-11)076/077). The anteroposterior diameter of the dural sac at the most stenotic level and nerve root sedimentation sign in magnetic resonance images were measured in patients with lumbar canal stenosis. Point estimate and 95% Confidence Interval were calculated.
RESULTS: Among 40 patients enrolled, 34 (85%) (84.01-85.99, 95% Confidence Interval) patients had positive nerve root sedimentation sign. Out of 34 (85%) cases with positive sedimentation signs, 32 (94.12%) had severe lumbar stenosis and the remaining 2 (5.88%) had moderate lumbar stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of nerve root sedimentation signs is similar to the similar studies done in similar settings. Nerve root sedimentation signs on magnetic resonance imaging can be used as an objective sign for the diagnosis of severe lumbar canal stenosis.
