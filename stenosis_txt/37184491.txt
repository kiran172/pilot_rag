Title: Computed tomography-guided interstitial implantation of I (125) radioactive seeds in the treatment of hilar airway stenosis caused by non-small cell lung cancer.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway stenosis secondary to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the severe complications that can lead to life-threatening outcomes.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical utility of computed tomography (CT)-guided interstitial implantation of radioactive I-125 seeds in the treatment of hilar airway stenosis caused by NSCLC.
METHODS: The cases of hilar airway stenosis caused by NSCLC in our hospital from 2017 to 2022 were collected and divided into observation and control groups. Both groups underwent conventional lung cancer treatment, and the observation group was treated with CT-guided interstitial implantation of radioactive I-125 seeds. The mean tumor diameter, hilar airway stenosis, and obstructive pneumonia scores at 3 months after treatment were compared between the two groups.
RESULTS: After 3 months of treatment, the mean tumor diameter (28.8 ± 9.3 mm vs 49.33 ± 16.75 mm, P  < 0.001), hilar airway stenosis (20.55 ± 30.36% vs 84.85 ± 26.19%, P  < 0.001), and obstructive pneumonia score (2.19 ± 1.41 vs 3.48 ± 1.12, P  < 0.001) of the observation group were significantly lower than those of the control group.
CONCLUSION: CT-guided interstitial implantation of I (125) radioactive seeds in the treatment of hilar airway stenosis caused by NSCLC can effectively reduce the tumor volume, relieve airway stenosis, and alleviate the associated obstructive pneumonia and has a certain value of application in the clinic.
