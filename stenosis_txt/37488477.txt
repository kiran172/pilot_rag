Title: Progressive arteriopathy with vasospasm in focal cerebral arteriopathy in childhood: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Focal cerebral arteriopathy (FCA) is a clinically important disease that often causes progressive arteriopathy. We report a case of FCA with progressive arteriopathy due to arterial shrinkage of the outer diameter found on T2-weighted three-dimensional sampling perfection with application optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions (3D-SPACE) imaging.
CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 9-year-old girl who developed right hemiparesis. Acute infarction was detected in the basal ganglia. Vascular images revealed stenosis from the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) to the middle cerebral artery (MCA). Intravenous heparin was administered for 8 days, and the symptoms improved. However, 29 days after onset, right hemiparesis transiently developed again and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed progressive stenosis from the ICA to MCA, while 3D-SPACE showed similar shrinkage of the outer diameter. Aspirin was started, and there was no subsequent recurrence. After 12 months, MRA and 3D-SPACE showed improvement of stenosis and arterial shrinkage.
CONCLUSIONS: Given the time course, the change in the outer diameter was thought to be vasospasm. Thus, vasospasm may be one of the causes of progressive arteriopathy in FCA.
