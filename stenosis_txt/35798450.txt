Title: Carotid Artery Stenting: JACC State-of-the-Art Review.

Abstract: Significant advances in the field of carotid artery stenting (CAS) have occurred, including new randomized trial data, recent professional societal statements for competency, new techniques and new devices that have been developed, and perhaps most importantly, our understanding of how to better select candidates for CAS to avoid periprocedural complications. The current Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services coverage decision regarding CAS is outdated, and our review supports our recommendation to approve CAS in selected candidates who are symptomatic with a carotid stenosis ≥50% and ≤99% and for asymptomatic patients with carotid stenosis ≥70% and ≤99% for stroke prevention. Optimized CAS strategies have allowed experienced operators to better assess procedure risk before CAS and have led to continued improvement in CAS outcomes. New technologies including enhanced embolic protection devices and dual-layered stents should result in further improvement.
