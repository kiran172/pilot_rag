Title: Disease severity prognostication in primary sclerosing cholangitis: a validation of the Anali scores and comparison with the potential functional stricture.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Our aim was twofold. First, to validate Anali scores with and without gadolinium (ANALI<sub>Gd</sub> and ANALI<sub>NoGd</sub>) in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) patients. Second, to compare the ANALIs prognostic ability with the recently-proposed potential functional stricture (PFS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study included 123 patients with a mean age of 41.5 years, who underwent gadoxetic acid-enahnced MRI (GA-MRI). Five readers independently evaluated all images for calculation of ANALI<sub>Gd</sub> and ANALI<sub>NoGd</sub> scores based upon following criteria: intrahepatic bile duct change severity, hepatic dysmorphia, liver parenchymal heterogeneity, and portal hypertension. In addition, hepatobiliary contrast excretion into first-order bile ducts was evaluated on 20-minute hepatobiliary-phase (HBP) images to assess PFS. Inter- and intrareader agreement were calculated (Fleiss´and Cohen kappas). Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for survival analysis. ANALI<sub>NoGd</sub>, ANALI<sub>Gd</sub>, and PFS were correlated with clinical scores, labs and outcomes (Cox regression analysis).
RESULTS: Inter-reader agreement was almost perfect (ϰ = 0.81) for PFS, but only moderate-(ϰ = 0.55) for binary ANALI<sub>NoGd</sub>. For binary ANALI<sub>Gd</sub>, the agreement was slightly better on HBP (ϰ = 0.64) than on arterial-phase (AP) (ϰ = 0.53). Univariate Cox regression showed that outcomes for decompensated cirrhosis, orthotopic liver transplantation or death significantly correlated with PFS (HR (hazard ratio) = 3.15, p &lt; 0.001), ANALI<sub>NoGd</sub> (HR = 6.42, p &lt; 0.001), ANALI<sub>Gd</sub>HBP (HR = 3.66, p &lt; 0.001) and ANALI<sub>Gd</sub>AP (HR = 3.79, p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis identified the PFS, all three ANALI scores, and Revised Mayo Risk Score as independent risk factors for outcomes (HR 3.12, p &lt; 0.001; 6.12, p &lt; 0.001; 3.56, p &lt; 0.001;3.59, p &lt; 0.001; and 4.13, p &lt; 0.001, respectively).
CONCLUSION: ANALI<sub>NoGd</sub> and GA-MRI-derived ANALI scores and PFS could noninvasively predict outcomes in PSC patients.
CLINICAL RELEVANCE STATEMENT: The combined use of Anali scores and the potential functional stricture (PFS), both derived from unenhanced-, and gadoxetic acid enhanced-MRI, could be applied as a diagnostic and prognostic imaging surrogate for counselling and monitoring primary sclerosing cholangitis patients.
KEY POINTS: Primary sclerosing cholangitis patients require radiological monitoring to assess disease stability and for the presence and type of complications. A contrast-enhanced MRI algorithm based on potential functional stricture and ANALI scores risk-stratified these patients. Unenhanced ANALI score had a high negative predictive value, indicating some primary sclerosing cholangitis patients can undergo non-contrast MRI surveillance.
