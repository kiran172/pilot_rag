Title: Stenting for elderly patients with internal carotid artery stenosis: analysis of clinical efficacy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This retrospective study aimed to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of carotid artery stenting (CAS) in elderly patients with internal carotid artery stenosis (ICS).
METHODS: Ninety elderly ICS patients admitted between January 2019 - July 2021 were selected and divided into a control group and a research group according to different treatment method. The 42 cases in the control group were received carotid endarterectomy and the 48 cases in the research group were treated with CAS. The effects of the two intervention methods on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, complication rate, oxidative stress, inflammatory cytokines and cognitive function were observed and evaluated.
RESULTS: Compared to baseline (before treatment), the research group showed significantly reduced scores of NIHSS and activities of daily living, appreciably decreased levels of malonaldehyde, interleukin-6 and high-sensitivity C-reactive-protein, but increased superoxide dismutase, Rapid Verbal Retrieve score and Digit Span Test score after treatment. Also, the same trends were found when comparing the above results with those of the control group after treatment. The two groups showed a comparable complication rate.
CONCLUSIONS: The above data indicate a definite clinical efficacy and a favorable safety profile of CAS for ICS in the elderly. CAS can effectively reduce the oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines of patients and enhance their cognitive function.
