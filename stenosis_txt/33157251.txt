Title: Complex Vascular Revascularization in a Young Woman with Type 1 Neurofibromatosis.

Abstract: We present an uncommon case of a 16-year-old woman with type 1 neurofibromatosis and renovascular hypertension due to bilateral renal stenosis associated with asymptomatic digestive artery stenosis. Our patient was treated by several autologous bypasses to the superior mesenteric artery and the left and right renal arteries. She had no postoperative complications and good clinical and imaging outcomes at 10Â years. Furthermore, there are few data on the vascular impairment of this rare disease, thus justifying its presentation.
