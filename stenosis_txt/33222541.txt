Title: Prevalence and Definition of Multilevel Lumbar Developmental Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study.
OBJECTIVES: To define multilevel lumbar developmental spinal stenosis (DSS) using a composite score model and to determine its prevalence.
METHODS: This was a cohort study of 2385 openly recruited subjects with lumbosacral (L1-S1) MRIs. All subjects with previous spinal surgery or spinal deformities were excluded. The anteroposterior (AP) vertebral canal diameter was measured by two independent observers. Any associations between level-specific vertebral canal diameter and subject body habitus were analysed with non-parametric tests. Three or more stenotic levels, equivalent to a composite score of 3 or more, were considered as multilevel DSS. The median values of these subjects' AP canal diameters were used to construct the multilevel DSS values. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was utilized to determine the ability of these cut-off values to screen for DSS by presenting their area under curve, sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: Subject body habitus was poorly correlated with AP vertebral canal diameter. Multilevel DSS was identified as L1<19 mm, L2<19 mm, L3<18 mm, L4<18 mm, L5<18 mm, S1<16 mm with 81%-96% sensitivity and 72%-91% specificity. The prevalence of multilevel DSS in this cohort was 7.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing a large homogeneous cohort, the prevalence of multilevel DSS is determined. Our cut-offs provide high diagnostic accuracy. Patients with multiple levels that fulfil these criteria may be at-risk of spinal canal compressions at multiple sites.
