Title: Aortic Reconstruction by Cadaveric Graft After Radical Resection of Recurrent Retroperitoneal Leyomiosarcoma - A Case Report and Literature Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: Retroperitoneal sarcomas represent very aggressive malignancies with high capacity of invading the surrounding vital structures.
CASE REPORT: We present the case of a 46-year-old patient who had been initially diagnosed with a large retroperitoneal mass 18 months ago. At that moment the mass was resected en bloc with the inferior cava vein, which was reconstructed using a cadaveric graft, the histopathological studies demonstrating the presence of a leiomyosarcoma. One year later she was diagnosed with recurrent disease invading the abdominal aorta and a liver metastasis. This time the recurrence was resected en bloc with the abdominal aorta, which was reconstructed by placing a cadaveric graft; atypical liver resection was also performed. The postoperative course was uneventful.
CONCLUSION: Extended vascular resections and cadaveric graft reconstructions might be needed in order to achieve a good local control of the disease in patients with retroperitoneal sarcomas.
