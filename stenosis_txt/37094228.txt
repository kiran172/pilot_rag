Title: Surgical repair of interrupted right-sided cervical aortic arch with hypoplasia of the descending thoracic aorta in a child with PHACE syndrome.

Abstract: Obstruction of a right cervical aortic arch in association with hypoplasia of the descending aorta is a rare congenital cardiac malformation. We report the case of a 6-month-old boy with posterior fossa anomalies, hemangioma, arterial anomalies, cardiac anomalies and eye anomalies (PHACE) syndrome and interruption of a right-sided cervical aortic arch. The descending thoracic aorta in the child had a long hypoplastic segment and the patient also had small ventricular septal defect and pulmonary valve stenosis. The surgical technique of reconstruction of the aortic arch and the descending thoracic aorta through a median sternotomy is described.
