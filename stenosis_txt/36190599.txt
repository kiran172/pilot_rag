Title: Rings and Slings: Not Such Simple Things.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Vascular rings are congenital malformations resulting from abnormal development of the great vessels, with the consequent encircling and compression of the trachea, esophagus, or both. We conducted a review of the current literature to identify the different management strategies that can be implemented based on the prognosis of each of these anomalies.
RECENT FINDINGS: Although most vascular rings occur in isolation, they can also be associated with other congenital cardiac and/or respiratory diseases; therefore, thorough investigation is necessary before definitive surgical repair. Clinical presentation varies from asymptomatic to severe, with both respiratory and digestive symptoms. Although early surgical results are acceptable, the long-term outcome is variable; therefore, there is still controversy regarding the appropriate timing of treatment. This is especially true with regard to the Kommerell diverticulum (KD) and in patients without symptoms at the time of initial surgical evaluation. As more sophisticated diagnostic tools have become available and more studies on adults affected by this condition have been published, understanding of this condition and its additional clinical implications has grown and appears to be tilting management toward earlier intervention.
