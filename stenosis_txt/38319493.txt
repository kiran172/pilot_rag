Title: Imaging biomarkers in cardiac CT: moving beyond simple coronary anatomical assessment.

Abstract: Cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is considered the standard non-invasive tool to rule-out obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). Moreover, several imaging biomarkers have been developed on cardiac-CT imaging to assess global CAD severity and atherosclerotic burden, including coronary calcium scoring, the segment involvement score, segment stenosis score and the Leaman-score. Myocardial perfusion imaging enables the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and microvascular damage, and the CT-based fractional flow reserve quantification allows to evaluate non-invasively hemodynamic impact of the coronary stenosis. The texture and density of the epicardial and perivascular adipose tissue, the hypodense plaque burden, the radiomic phenotyping of coronary plaques or the fat radiomic profile are novel CT imaging features emerging as biomarkers of inflammation and plaque instability, which may implement the risk stratification strategies. The ability to perform myocardial tissue characterization by extracellular volume fraction and radiomic features appears promising in predicting arrhythmogenic risk and cardiovascular events. New imaging biomarkers are expanding the potential of cardiac CT for phenotyping the individual profile of CAD involvement and opening new frontiers for the practice of more personalized medicine.
