Title: Ethnic differences in coronary anatomy, left ventricular mass and CT-derived fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies have observed higher incidence of cardiovascular mortality in South Asians (SA), and lower prevalence in East Asians (EA), compared with Caucasians. These observations are not entirely explained by ethnic differences in cardiovascular risk factors and mechanistic factors such as variations in cardiac anatomy and physiology may play a role. This study compared ethnic differences in CT-assessed left ventricular (LV) mass, coronary anatomy and non-invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>).
METHODS: Three-hundred symptomatic patients (age 59 ± 7.9, male 51%) underwent clinically-mandated CT-coronary-angiography (CTA) were matched for age, gender, BMI and diabetes (100 each ethnicity). Assessment of coronary stenosis, luminal dimensions and vessel dominance was performed by independent observers. LV mass, coronary luminal volume and FFR<sub>CT</sub> were quantified by blinded core-laboratory. A sub-analysis was performed on patients (n = 187) with normal/minimal disease (0-25% stenosis).
RESULTS: Stenosis severity was comparable across ethnic groups. EA demonstrated less left-dominant circulation (2%) compared with SA (8.2%) and Caucasians (10.1%). SA compared with EA and Caucasians demonstrated smallest indexed LV mass, coronary luminal volumes and dimensions. EA compared with Caucasians had comparable indexed LV mass, coronary luminal dimensions and highest luminal volumes. The latter was driven by higher prevalence of right-dominance including larger and longer right posterior left ventricular artery. FFR<sub>CT</sub> in the left anterior descending artery (LAD) was lowest in SA (0.87) compared with EA (0.89; P = 0.009) and Caucasians (0.89; P &lt; 0.001), with no difference in other vessels. All observed differences were consistent in patients with minimal disease.
CONCLUSION: This single-centre study identified significant ethnic differences in CT-assessed LV mass, coronary anatomy and LAD FFR<sub>CT</sub>. These hypotheses generating results may provide a mechanistic explanation for ethnic differences in cardiovascular outcomes and require validation in larger cohorts.
