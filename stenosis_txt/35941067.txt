Title: Proximal Optimization Technique with an Ultra-Short Balloon as a Bailout Strategy for Stent Protrusion into the Left Main Trunk.

Abstract: A 64-year-old man presented with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Emergent coronary angiography revealed severe stenosis at the proximal left anterior descending artery (LAD). A drug-eluting stent was deployed to land the stent's proximal edge on the LAD ostium. However, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) after stent placement detected a slight stent protrusion from the LAD into the left main trunk (LMT), and the left circumflex artery (LCX) ostium was jailed by stent struts. We decided to perform the proximal optimization technique (POT) using an ultra-short balloon (4 mm in length) on the proximal site of the stent in the hope of dilating jailed struts at the LCX ostium and expanding malapposed struts at the LMT without proximal edge dissection. IVUS after POT confirmed a well-enlarged stent cell at the ostial LCX and adequate stent apposition at the LMT. Angiography showed preserved LCX circulation. At one-year follow-up, angiography showed no in-stent restenosis or LCX ostial stenosis. Optical coherence tomography showed remarkable expansion of the stent struts at the LCX ostium without any restenosis. A single POT with an ultra-short balloon could be a potential bailout strategy in the treatment of coronary bifurcation lesions with slight stent protrusion into the proximal main vessel.
