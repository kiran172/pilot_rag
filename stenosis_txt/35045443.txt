Title: [Preoperative Esophageal Decompression and Enteral Nutrition Using a W-ED Tube in Patients with Esophagogastric Junction Cancer-A Case Report].

Abstract: The patient was a 67-year-old male diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction. The esophagus was markedly dilated due to severe stenosis, and aspiration pneumonia was observed. Therefore, he was treated with a W- ED tube for simultaneous esophageal decompression and enteral nutrition. Two weeks of W-ED tube placement improved esophageal dilatation and pneumonia while maintaining nutritional status; thus, he underwent proximal gastrectomy, lower esophagectomy and combined resection of distal pancreas, spleen and left crus of diaphragm with jejunal interposition reconstruction. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged 16 days after surgery without any postoperative infectious complications such as pneumonia, anastomotic leakage, pancreatic fistula and enterocolitis. In the preoperative management for patients with esophagogastric junction cancer with severe stenosis, simultaneous esophageal decompression and enteral nutrition using a W-ED tube is very useful because it can improve aspiration pneumonia, reduce the risk of anastomotic leakage by improving esophageal edema, and prevent disuse atrophy of small intestinal villi.
