Title: Undiagnosed Osteoporotic Vertebral Fractures in an Octogenarian During the Coronavirus Disease Pandemic.

Abstract: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are frequently misdiagnosed or under-recognized in the older population, leading to disease progression and reduced quality of life. This case of an 87-year-old woman with acute back pain highlights the importance of early diagnosis and management of fragility fractures. During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, patients with a history of well-managed osteoporosis experienced worsening symptoms of vertebral collapse due to activity limitations and prolonged immobilization. The initial diagnosis of spinal stenosis delayed appropriate treatment for four months. Serial magnetic resonance imaging revealed compression fractures at L1 and L3, and a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan showed osteoporosis with a T-score of -3.2. Pharmacological therapy, including bisphosphonates, was initiated. A comprehensive rehabilitation program with a multidisciplinary approach, with bracing, and lifestyle changes helped stabilize the spine, reduce pain, and maximized function. Her condition improved with close monitoring and guidance during home exercises. This case exemplifies the necessity of a precise and timely diagnosis of osteoporotic vertebral fractures to initiateÂ management and mitigate disease progression.
