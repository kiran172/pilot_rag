Title: A case of Candida parapsilosis bioprosthetic valve endocarditis.

Abstract: Fungal bioprosthetic valve endocarditis is regarded as a rare, fatal disease. Severe aortic valve stenosis due to vegetation in bioprosthetic valves was also rare. Because biofilm formation is a factor related to persistent infection, the best outcomes for endocarditis are achieved in patients treated surgically with concomitant antifungal medicine.
