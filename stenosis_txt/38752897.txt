Title: Prognostic Value of Microvascular Resistance Reserve After Percutaneous Coronary Intervention in Patients With Myocardial Infarction.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The microvascular resistance reserve (MRR) has recently been introduced as a novel index to assess the vasodilatory capacity of the microcirculation, independent of epicardial disease. The prognostic value of MRR in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is unknown.
OBJECTIVES: The aim of this analysis was to investigate the prognostic value of MRR in patients with STEMI and to compare MRR with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging parameters.
METHODS: From a pooled analysis of individual patient data from 6 cohorts that measured the index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR) directly after primary percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with STEMI (n = 1,265), a subgroup analysis was performed in patients in whom both MRR and IMR were available. The primary endpoint was the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure.
RESULTS: Both MRR and IMR could be calculated in 446 patients. The optimal cutoff of MRR to predict the primary endpoint in this STEMI population was 1.25. During a median follow-up of 3.1 years (Q1-Q3: 1.5-6.1 years), the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure occurred in 27.3% and 5.9% of patients (HR: 4.16; 95% CI: 2.31-7.50; P < 0.001) in the low MRR (≤1.25) and high MRR (>1.25) groups, respectively. Both IMR and MRR were independent predictors of the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure.
CONCLUSIONS: MRR measured directly after primary percutaneous coronary intervention was an independent predictor of the composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure during long-term follow-up.
