Title: Safe carotid endarterectomy: "one fits all strategy".

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid artery stenosis of 50% or more in the extracranial internal carotid artery is responsible for 10-15% of all strokes. Interventional treatment options include carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting, where endarterectomy is proven to be superior.
AIM: In this study, we report the carotid endarterectomy results of patients we operated on using the strategy we termed the "one fits all strategy".
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-six patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy between July 2016 and April 2020 were retrospectively studied. Conventional endarterectomy under general anesthesia with primary closure of the arteriotomy was performed in all patients. We used a near infrared spectroscopy oximeter to measure regional cerebral oxygenation continuously throughout the surgery.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 70.96 8.15 years. There were 52 male and 24 female patients. The mean follow-up time was 20.6 Â±13.6 months. Coronary artery disease was detected in 52 (73.6%) patients. Coronary artery bypass operation was indicated in 19 patients in whom a staged approach was performed in 13 and a reverse staged approach in 1. There were two perioperative strokes one of which recovered fully spontaneously and the other partially with physiotherapy. Eight cases were revised due to hematoma formation.
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid endarterectomy continues to prove its safety in carotid artery stenosis patients. Continuous cerebral oxygenation monitoring is indispensable for carotid surgery. Despite discrepancies in surgical techniques, we believe that "one fits all strategy: general anesthesia, conventional endarterectomy without patch plasty, never shunter and always NIRS monitorization" may be used safely in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy.
