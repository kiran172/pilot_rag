Title: Temporary tracheotomy for post-intubation laryngeal edema after lung cancer surgery: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the post-intubation period, laryngeal edema is one of the most severe complications, which can cause significant morbidity and even death. Herein, we report a case in which we performed a temporary tracheostomy during surgery because of the risk of postoperative laryngeal edema, successfully avoiding post-intubation laryngeal edema complications.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 78-year-old man underwent surgery for left upper lobe lung cancer. He had a history of chemoradiotherapy for laryngeal cancer, bronchial asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was diagnosed with grade 1 laryngeal edema using computed tomography, and there was a risk of developing post-intubation laryngeal edema. Additionally, there was a decrease in laryngeal and pulmonary functions; therefore, postoperative aspiration pneumonia was judged to be a fatal risk. A temporary tracheostomy was performed during surgery to avoid postoperative intubation laryngeal edema. He was found to have exacerbated laryngeal edema, which is a serious complication of airway stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Temporary tracheostomy should be considered to avoid airway stenosis due to post-intubation laryngeal edema in patients with laryngeal edema after radiotherapy.
