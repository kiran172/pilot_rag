Title: [Carotid Artery Stenosis:Endovascular Techniques and Devices].

Abstract: The increase in the number of carotid artery stenting cases can be attributed to a decrease in complications owing to the evolution of devices. In this procedure, the choice of the protection device and stent for each case is the main concern. Embolic protection devices(EPD)that prevent distal embolization can be divided into proximal and distal types. Previously, balloon-type devices were used as distal EPDs; however, since they are no longer available, filter-type devices are now mainstream. Carotid stents are also divided into open- and closed-cell types. Therefore, this review describes the characteristics of each device in the actual cases at our hospital.
