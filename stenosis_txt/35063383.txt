Title: Safety and Feasibility of Rotational Atherectomy in Severe Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the safety and feasibility of rotational atherectomy (RA) in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS).
BACKGROUND: Heavily calcified coronary lesions are commonly encountered in elderly patients with severe AS who are being considered for transcatheter aortic valve implantation. The use of RA in these patients is controversial as they may be at a higher risk of complications.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled patients with severe AS who underwent RA across two hospitals from March 2010 to September 2019. Patients with severe AS prior to or within 8 weeks of RA were included.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven (27) consecutive patients (83±5.2 yrs 63% male) with severe AS (peak velocity 4.1±0.5 m/s, mean gradient 40.0±10.2 mmHg) were enrolled and 31 lesions were treated with RA across 30 separate procedures. Three (3) (11.1%) patients had left ventricular ejection fraction ≤30%. Nine (9) (30%) procedures involved percutaneous coronary intervention of multiple arteries, with most lesions in the right coronary artery (51.6%) and left anterior descending artery (32.3%). Three (3) (9.7%) lesions were in the left main stem. RA-facilitated stenting was successful in all lesions. There were no episodes of coronary perforation or slow-flow/no-reflow. There was one episode of coronary dissection in an artery that did not undergo RA, which was successfully treated with a drug-eluting stent. There were no deaths within 30 days and three deaths (11.1%) within 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: Rotational atherectomy in patients with severe AS is feasible and has a low rate of procedural complications.
