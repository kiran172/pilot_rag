Title: External compression due to seroma of ventricular assist device outflow graft.

Abstract: A 45-year-old woman with repaired complex congenital heart disease, who underwent placement of Jarvik 2000, a ventricular assist device (VAD) for 4Â years, experienced abdominal pain due to outflow graft compression caused by seroma formation between the outflow graft and ringed Gore-Tex graft. We exchanged the pump of Jarvik 2000 and punched several small holes in the new ringed Gore-Tex graft. Seroma formation between the two grafts should be considered as a cause of outflow graft obstruction in patients with the long-term support of VAD, and additional surgical interventions to the ringed Gore-Tex graft may prevent this complication.
