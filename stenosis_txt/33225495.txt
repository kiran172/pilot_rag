Title: The changing landscape of percutaneous technology leading to surgical complications.

Abstract: With new technology comes new complications. We discuss the interesting case presented by Bjelic and colleagues regarding a misplaced TAVR (transcatheter aortic valve replacement) valve into the inflow cannula of a left ventricular assist device, leading to hemodynamic collapse. The author describes the pitfalls of the new technology and interesting surgical maneuvers to address these complications.
