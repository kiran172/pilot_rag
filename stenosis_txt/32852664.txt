Title: Factors affecting patency of arteriovenous fistula following first percutaneous transluminal angioplasty.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) has generally replaced surgical procedures to treat arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction, but the predictors of post-intervention patency are highly variable. This study aimed to determine predictors of primary patency following PTA of dysfunctional AVF.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective analysis of first-time PTA of 307 AVF in 307 patients (171 males, mean age 64.3 ± 12.4 years). Demographic, clinical, anatomical and medication variables were reviewed and subjected to univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis.
RESULTS: The post-intervention primary patency rates at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months were 76.3%, 58.3%, 43.2%, and 38.2%, respectively. The higher aortic arch calcification (AAC) grade patients were older, had higher incidence of comorbidities and cardiomegaly, and younger AVF age, but their dialysis vintage term was shorter and diastolic blood pressure was lower, and the maximum diameter of balloon angioplasty was mostly ≤ 6 mm, and had lower phosphorus level and less calcium-containing phosphate binder use. In multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, the presence of higher AAC grade [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): (1.46 (1.02-2.09); p = 0.037)] and stenosis at upper arm [1.76 (1.16-2.67); p = 0.008] were associated with shorter post-intervention primary patency.
CONCLUSION: In conclusion, higher AAC grade and anatomic factor related to the location of AVF (upper arm) were the important predictors of AVF dysfunction after PTA. These results could assist in tailoring surveillance programs and performing appropriate interventions for risky AVF.
