Title: A case series of 10 patients undergone linear cutter/stapler guiding device-led overlapped esophagojejunostomy: a preliminary study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In laparoscopic total gastrectomy with overlap esophagojejunostomy (EJS), esophageal 'false track' is easily formed during EJS. In this study, a linear cutter/stapler guiding device (LCSGD) was used in EJS, so that the linear cutting stapler can complete the technical action with high speed and high efficiency in a narrow space, while avoiding the formation of 'false passage', optimizing the quality of common opening and shortening the anastomosis time. The LCSGD is safe and feasible in laparoscopic total gastrectomy overlap EJS, and the clinical effect is satisfactory.
METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive design was adopted. The clinical data of 10 gastric cancer patients admitted to the Third Department of Surgery of the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University from July 2021 to November 2021 were collected. The cohort comprised 8 males and 2 females aged 50-75 years.
RESULTS: (I) The intra-operative conditions: 10 patients received LCSGD-guided overlap EJS after radical laparoscopic total gastrectomy. Both D2 lymphadenectomy and R0 resection were achieved in these patients. No combined multiple organ resection was performed. There was neither conversion to an open thoracic or abdominal procedure nor conversion to other EJS approaches. The average time from the entry of the LCSGD into the abdominal cavity to the completion of the firing of the stapler was 1.8±0.4 minutes, the average time for manual suturing of the EJS common opening was 14.4±2.1 minutes (mean: 18±2 stitches), and the average operative time was 255±52 minutes. (II) The postoperative outcomes: the time to the first ambulation was 1.9±1.4 days, the average time to the first postoperative exhaust/defecation was 3.5±1.3 days, the average time to a semi-liquid diet was 3.6±0.7 days, and the average postoperative hospital stay was 10.4±4.1 days. All patients were smoothly discharged, without any secondary surgery, bleeding, anastomotic fistula, or duodenal stump fistula. (III) Follow-up: The telephone follow-up lasted 9-12 months. No eating disorders or anastomotic stenosis was reported. One patient experienced Visick grade II heartburn, and the condition of the remaining 9 patients was Visick grade I.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of the LCSGD in overlap EJS after laparoscopic total gastrectomy is safe and feasible, with satisfactory clinical effectiveness.
