Title: Carotid Endarterectomy for Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis: Differences in Patient Profile in a Low-Middle-Income Country.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the standard treatment for patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis. Data from low- and middle-income countries are sparse on CEA and its outcomes. We aimed to describe the profile of our patients and factors associated with periprocedural cerebral ischemic events in patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis who underwent CEA in our institute.
METHODS: Retrospective review of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis (50-99%) who underwent CEA between January 2011 and December 2021 was done. Clinical and imaging parameters and their influence on periprocedural cerebral ischemic events were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 319 patients (77% males) with a mean age of 64 years (SD±8.6), 207 (65%) presented only after a stroke. Majority (85%) had high-grade stenosis (≥70%) of the symptomatic carotid. The mean time to CEA was 50 days (SD±36); however, only 26 patients (8.2%) underwent surgery within 2 weeks. Minor strokes and TIA occurred in 2.2%, while major strokes and death occurred in 4.1% patients. None of the clinical or imaging parameters predicted the periprocedural cerebral ischemic events. The presence of co-existing significant (≥50%) tandem intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 77, 24%) or contralateral occlusion (n = 24, 7.5%) did not influence the periprocedural stroke risk.
CONCLUSION: There is a delay in patients undergoing CEA for symptomatic carotid stenosis. Majority have high-grade stenosis and present late only after a stroke reflecting a lack of awareness. CEA can be performed safely even in patients with significant intracranial tandem stenosis and contralateral carotid occlusion.
