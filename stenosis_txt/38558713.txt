Title: Assessing a Myocardial Area at Risk in Non-ST Elevation Acute Myocardial Infarction Without Wall Motion Abnormalities Using Cardiac Magnetic Resonance and Radionuclide Imaging.

Abstract: Evaluation of a myocardial area at risk is clinically important because it contributes to clinical decision-making and management of patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Herein, we reported a case of non-ST-elevation AMI (non-STEMI) without wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography, in which the myocardial area at risk was evaluated by two modalities; cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) and radionuclide imaging. Coronary angiography revealed significant luminal stenosis in the diagonal branch and the obtuse marginal branch. It remained unclear which branch was the culprit. T2-weighted CMR revealed myocardial edema in the left ventricular anterolateral area. Based on the extent of myocardial edema, the patient was diagnosed with non-STEMI in the area corresponding to the diagonal branch. The area exhibiting impaired fatty acid metabolism on iodine-123-beta-methyl-p-iodophenyl penta-decanoic acid (123I-BMIPP) imaging matched well with the area showing myocardial edema on T2-weighted CMR. In conclusion, both CMR and BMIPP imaging are powerful tools in identifying a myocardial area at risk even in non-STEMI without wall motion abnormalities. This should contribute to clinical decision-making and management of patients with AMI.
