Title: Short and Intermediate-Term Outcome of Robot-Assisted Inverted YV-Plasty for Recurrent Bladder Neck Stenosis - a Single Centre Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To report the technique and preliminary results for extraperitoneal robot-assisted laparoscopic YV-plasty (RAYV) for refractory bladder neck stenosis (BNS) and vesicoureteral anastomosis stenosis (VUAS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Included were patients with recurrent BNS and VUAS who underwent RAYV at our institution. Primary outcome was short and intermediate-term functional results measured with urinary peak flow (Qmax), post-void residual urine (PVR) as well as quality of life assessment with the international prostate symptom score (IPSS) and short form health survey (SF-8). Short- and intermediate-term follow-up periods were defined as 1-6 months and 6-24 months, respectively. Secondary, all patients were reviewed for etiology as well as perioperative data. Treatment success was defined by absence of further treatment and/or need for intermittent or permanent catheterization.
RESULTS: Between March 2016 and October 2020 a total of 30 patients with a median age of 70.8 (64-77) years underwent RAYV with a median follow-up of 27 months. Median operative time (skin-skin) was 131 (112-145) minutes. The transurethral indwelling catheter was removed after 10 (5 - 16) days. There were no intraoperative complications but 2 postoperative major complications Clavien-Dindo IIIa and IV, respectively. Short- and intermediate-term results revealed significant improvement of IPS score from 17 (11-24) points to 11 (6-13) points and 6 (3-9) points, respectively. Further PVR decreased from 90 (5-302) mL to 0 (0-30) mL and 0 (0-90) mL, respectively, and Qmax increased from 7.4 mL/s to 13 (8-16) mL/s and 17 (12-4) mL/s, respectively. Improvement of SF-8 did not reach significance. A total of 5/30 (16.7%) patients had a treatment failure after 24 months whereof 2 had a re-stricture.
CONCLUSION: RAVY-Plasty for recurrent bladder neck stenosis is a safe and effective procedure with good functional short- and intermediate-term outcome.
