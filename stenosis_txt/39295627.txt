Title: Relationships between stenosis severity, functional limitation, pain, and quality of life in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aimed to examine the relationships between severity of stenosis, pain, functional limitation, disability, and quality of life in patients with cervical spondylotic radiculopathy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients (45 female, 19 male) with radiculopathy due to spondylotic changes in the cervical spine were included in this study. Stenosis severity (thecal sac cross-sectional area (CSA)), numbness, neck and arm pain severity, functional limitation (Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale), disability, and quality of life (EQ-5D-3L General Quality of Life Scale) were evaluated. The study was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT06001359.
RESULTS: According to CSA values, 28 (43.75%) patients had severe stenosis and 36 (56.25%) had moderate stenosis, and the average CSA was 81.65 ± 10.08 mm2. Positive correlations were found between both neck and arm pain and neck disability (r = 0.597, r = 0.359), and negative correlations were found for the General Quality of Life Scale index score and EQ-5D-3L visual analog scale (r = -0.787, r = -0.518). There were significant positive correlations between Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale subscales and severity of stenosis, neck and arm pain, numbness, and disability (p &lt; 0.05 for all). A significant negative correlation was observed between Cervical Radiculopathy Impact Scale subscales and quality of life (p &lt; 0.01). Stenosis severity was correlated with pain, neck disability, and quality of life (p &lt; 0.01 for all).
CONCLUSION: There are direct relationships between cervical spondylotic radiculopathy and neck and arm pain, numbness, disability, and quality of life. Additionally, an increase in the severity of cervical stenosis is associated with an increase in pain and disability.
