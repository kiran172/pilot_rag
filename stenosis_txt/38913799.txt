Title: Cervical Dissection in Patients With Tandem Lesions Is Associated With Distal Embolism and Lower Recanalization Success.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tandem lesions consist of cervical internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis or occlusion, most commonly of atherosclerosis or dissection etiology, plus a large vessel occlusion. In this study, we compare outcomes in patients with atherosclerosis versus dissection of the cervical ICA.
METHODS: This multicenter retrospective cohort study includes data from tandem lesion patients who underwent endovascular treatment from 2015 to 2020. Atherosclerosis was defined as ICA stenosis/occlusion associated with a calcified lesion and dissection by the presence of a tapered or flame-shaped lesion and intramural hematoma. Primary outcome: 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2); secondary outcomes: 90-day favorable shift in the modified Rankin Scale score, modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2b-3, modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score 2c-3, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, parenchymal hematoma type 2, petechial hemorrhage, distal embolization, early neurological improvement, and mortality. Analysis was performed with matching by inverse probability of treatment weighting.
RESULTS: We included 526 patients (68 [59-76] years; 31% females); 11.2% presented dissection and 88.8%, atherosclerosis. Patients with dissection were younger, had lower rates of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and smoking history. They also exhibited higher rates of ICA occlusion, multiple stents (&gt;1), and lower rates of carotid self-expanding stents. After matching and adjusting for covariates, there were no differences in 90-day functional independence. The rate of successful recanalization was significantly lower in the dissection group (adjusted odds ratio, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.16-0.91]; P=0.031), which also had significantly higher rates of distal emboli (adjusted odds ratio, 2.53 [95% CI, 1.15-5.55]; P=0.021). There were no differences in other outcomes. Acute ICA stenting seemed to increase the effect of atherosclerosis in successful recanalization.
CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that among patients with acute stroke with tandem lesions, cervical ICA dissection is associated with higher rates of distal embolism and lower rates of successful recanalization than atherosclerotic lesions. Using techniques to minimize the risk of distal embolism may mitigate this contrast. Further prospective randomized trials are warranted to fully understand these associations.
