Title: Are hypertensive patients with history of coronary artery disease at risk for silent lower extremity artery disease?

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association between hypertension and asymptomatic lower extremity artery disease (LEAD) in outpatients with known history of coronary artery disease (CAD).
METHODS: Patients with known history of CAD who have been undergone coronary angiography and have significant coronary artery stenosis (more than 60%) were included. LEAD was defined as ankle-brachial index (ABI) < 0.9 in either leg. The risk of LEAD in hypertensive group was analyzed using chi-square test, and correlation between blood pressure (BP) and ABI was analyzed using Pearson correlation test in SPSS v.25.
RESULTS: One hundred and four patients were included. 82.7% of patients were male. Mean age was 57.05 ± 7.97. The prevalence of hypertension was 35.6%, and the prevalence of LEAD was 16.3%. A higher proportion of LEAD was found in hypertensive (18.9%) compared to non-hypertensive (14.9%), although not statistically significant (OR: 1.33; 95% CI: 0.46 to 3.85; p=0.598). There was an association between ABI and systolic BP (p=0.016), but not with diastolic BP (p=0.102).
CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that the prevalence of LEAD in hypertension, especially in the CAD population, is relatively high. There was no association between hypertension and LEAD, but a higher prevalence of LEAD was found in hypertensive patients. Nevertheless, LEAD screening is still recommended in hypertensive patients, especially in the CAD population, given the fact that outcomes of health and mortality are worse for those with concomitants of these diseases.
