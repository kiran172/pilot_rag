Title: Subclinical Leaflet Thrombosis in Supra-annular Transcatheter Aortic Valves: the Role of Leaflet Design.

Abstract: Subclinical leaflet thrombosis has been increasingly observed in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Intra-annular transcatheter aortic valves (TAVs) have a larger neo-sinus volume than supra-annular devices and are potentially at a higher risk of hypoattenuated leaflet thickening (HALT). However, clinical data from randomized clinical trials have shown that approximately one-third of patients undergoing TAVR with intra- or supra-annular devices develop HALT in 1Â year. The findings point to the potential role of leaflet design in developing HALT. The study aimed to systematically investigate leaflet kinematics of a supra-annular TAV, Medtronic CoreValve, and determine regions of blood stasis. Fluid-solid interaction simulations demonstrated the limited movement of CoreValve leaflets in the lower belly region that created regions of blood stasis on the surface of the leaflets. The findings provide insights into potential improvements in leaflet design in the next generation of TAVs to reduce the risk of HALT and leaflet immobility.
