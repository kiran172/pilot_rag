Title: Transcarotid Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement in an Octogenarian With Complex Type B Aortic Dissection and Aneurysm: A Case Report.

Abstract: We report the case of an octogenarian with severe aortic valve stenosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure. Due to advanced CKD, we used a 3-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram for sizing the device before transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Noncontrast computed tomography found complex aortic dissection involving the arch, descending thoracic aorta, and abdominal aorta. TAVR was approached via the right carotid artery using a CoreValve. There was no cerebral vascular event. Renal function was well preserved. Transcarotid TAVR can be performed safely with complex type B aortic dissection. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiogram provides an alternative sizing solution in advanced CKD.
