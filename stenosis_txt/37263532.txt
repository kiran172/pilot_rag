Title: Is elevated ENA-78 serum level a link between obstructive sleep apnea and atherosclerosis?

Abstract: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, inflammation, and oxidative stress. This study compared serum levels of different factors in patients with carotid artery stenosis and with or without coexisting OSA. It also aimed to identify a molecule that may be crucial for the inflammatory process correlated with intermittent hypoxia. Sixty-eight subjects scheduled for surgical treatment of carotid artery stenosis were enrolled. Polygraphy was performed the night before the surgery. Morning levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemotactic and angiogenic factors were measured. The most profound differences between the groups were found for ENA-78 serum concentration. However, as many factors could affect the results, further studies are needed to investigate the role of ENA-78 in atherosclerosis in patients suffering from OSA.
