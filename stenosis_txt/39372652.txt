Title: An uncommon cause of a common disease: a case report of a rare cause of hypertension.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe hypertension in young patients presents a significant diagnostic dilemma, and treatment can often be codified. Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose these cases for probable secondary hypertension. Common causes of secondary hypertension include large vessel vasculitis, renal artery stenosis, coarctation of the aorta, and endocrine disorders.
CASE SUMMARY: A 23-year-old Asian male, who was previously in good health, presented with symptoms of chest pain, shortness of breath on exertion grade II, and generalized weakness. On examination, his blood pressure was markedly elevated at 200/110â€…mmHg. Diagnostic investigations revealed significant vascular involvement, including bilateral renal artery stenosis accompanied by aneurysm formation, celiac trunk disease, and osteal stenosis of the superior mesenteric artery. The patient underwent successful interventional procedure, including renal angioplasty, stenting, and aneurysm coiling. This was followed by tailoring of medical management along with anti-inflammatory and disease-modifying drugs.
DISCUSSION: The diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis (TAK) in this case is supported by the patients' age, presentation, and imaging according to the new TAK classification criteria by the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and emphasizes the potential benefits of a pharmaco-invasive approach for optimal outcomes.
