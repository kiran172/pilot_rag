Title: Hemi-circumferential mucosal resection and anastomosis procedure for rectal prolapse following anorectoplasty for anorectal malformations.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Rectal prolapse after radical surgery for anorectal malformations (ARMs) is a common postoperative complication that causes bleeding and stenosis, and sometimes requires surgical treatment. Different surgical techniques have been reported, but most are associated with high recurrence rates and a long postoperative stay. We performed the hemi-circumferential mucosal resection and anastomosis procedure (HCMR) to preserve anal muscle and anal function. Here, we report the success of our minimally invasive surgical approach to correct rectal prolapse in patients with ARMs.
METHODS: The subjects of this retrospective review were patients who underwent HCMR for rectal prolapse after radical surgery for ARMs between January, 2014 and August, 2021. HCMR involves rectal mucosal resection without muscle plication.
RESULTS: A collective 15 HCMR procedures were performed in 10 patients. The median age at repair was 1.8 years (range, 10 months-18 years). The median operation time and postoperative length of stay were 46 min (range, 17-85 min) and 3 days (range, 1-7 days), respectively. The median postoperative observation period was 3 years 4 months (range, 8 months-7 years 10 months) and no complications or recurrences were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: HCMR is a safe and effective surgical treatment for rectal prolapse after radical operation for ARMs, which is minimally invasive and preserves rectal muscle and function.
