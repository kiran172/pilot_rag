Title: Case Series - Pediatric Tracheostomy for Upper Airway Obstruction.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Certain congenital craniofacial malformations can cause upper airway obstruction. Due to neurological involvement, these craniofacial deformities with upper airway blockage frequently require tracheostomy. Children who need weeks or months of continuous ventilator assistance require tracheostomies, which improve pulmonary toilet and decrease laryngotracheal lesions such subglottic stenosis and tracheomalacia. In this case report we will be discussing about two patients who underwent Pediatric tracheostomy for Pierre Robin sequence and supraglottic stenosis in our institute. This paper emphasizes on some of the rare causes of pediatric upper airway obstruction - Pierre Robin sequence and supraglottic stenosis. Also the importance of tracheostomy procedure, which is the gold standard for management of upper airway obstruction in patients who are not responding to conservative management is emphasized.
