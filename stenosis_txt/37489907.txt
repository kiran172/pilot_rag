Title: Aortopathy: Effects of Lipid-Lowering Therapy.

Abstract: Aortopathies can be congenital or acquired. Aortic atherosclerosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm, and degenerative aortic stenosis are some of the major manifestations of acquired aortopathy. Dyslipidemia, an imbalance of plasma lipid levels, is strongly associated with common aortopathies. A relationship between abdominal aortic aneurysm, degenerative aortic stenosis, and dyslipidemia has been identified in the literature but finding effective preventive strategies has been challenging. Nevertheless, lipid-lowering therapy remains a mainstay of both treatment and prevention. In patients with aortic atheroma, statins were found to be protective through the review of this study. There is currently no place for statins in the treatment or prevention of disease progression in patients with calcific aortic stenosis. Their low cost, widespread availability, and strong safety profile tip the risk-to-benefit ratio toward statins for abdominal aortic aneurysms but more research is needed. A review of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors may yield similar benefits for all aortopathy patients; however, those results are not yet available.
