Title: Cardiac Amyloidosis and Valvular Heart Disease.

Abstract: Growing interest has accrued in the co-existence of cardiac amyloidosis and valvular heart disease. Amyloid infiltration from either transthyretin (ATTR) or of light chain (AL) origin may affect any structure of the heart, including the valves. The recent literature has mainly focused on aortic stenosis and cardiac amyloidosis, improving our understanding of the epidemiology, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of this dual pathology. Despite being of high clinical relevance, data on mitral/tricuspid regurgitation and cardiac amyloidosis are rather scarce and mostly limited to case reports and small cases series. It is the aim of this review article to summarize the current evidence of concomitant valvular heart disease and cardiac amyloidosis by including studies on epidemiology, diagnostic approaches, screening possibilities, therapeutic management, and prognostic implications.
