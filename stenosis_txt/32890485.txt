Title: Benign Tracheoenteric Fistula to a Zenker's Diverticulum With Complete Esophageal Obstruction.

Abstract: A fistula between a Zenker's diverticulum and the trachea has only been reported once, in 1983. Here, we report a case of a fistula between a large Zenker's diverticulum and the trachea with complete occlusion of the esophagus. The fistula was repaired, first by an esophageal myotomy, followed by proximal resection of the diverticulum, completion of the esophageal myotomy, transection of the fistula, and repair of the trachea. The surgical repair provided complete resolution of symptoms without complications.
