Title: Stentless Versus Stented Aortic Valve Replacement for Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The differences in long-term outcomes of aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis between stentless and stented bioprostheses are controversial.
METHODS: Between 2007 and 2018, 1173 patients underwent aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis, including 559 treated with a stentless valve and 614 with a stented valve. A propensity score matched cohort with 348 pairs was generated by matching for age, sex, body surface area, bicuspid aortic valve, chronic lung disease, previous cardiac surgery, coronary artery disease, renal failure on dialysis, valve size, concomitant procedures, and surgeon. The primary endpoints of the study were long-term survival and incidence of reoperation.
RESULTS: Immediate postoperative outcomes were similar between the stentless and stented groups with an overall operative mortality of 2.9% (P = .19). Kaplan-Meier estimation for long-term survival was comparable between the stentless and stented valves in both the whole cohort and the propensity score matched cohort (10-year survival 59% vs 55%, P = .20). The hazard ratio of stentless vs stented valve for risk of long-term mortality was 1.12 (P = .33). The 10-year cumulative incidence of reoperation due to valve degeneration was 5.5% in the stentless group and 4.7% in the stented group (P = .25). The transvalvular pressure gradient at 5-year follow-up was significantly lower in the stentless group (7 vs 11 mm Hg, P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS: Both stented and stentless valves could be used in aortic valve replacement for aortic stenosis. We recommend stented valves for aortic valve replacement in patients with aortic stenosis for their simplicity of implantation.
