Title: Intraoperative Transesophageal Echocardiography Evaluation of Tricuspid Valve Re-repair for Ebstein's Anomaly.

Abstract: Postoperative stenosis or regurgitation of the tricuspid valve is common and affects the prognosis after repair surgery of Ebstein's anomaly. However, it is unclear how intraoperative echocardiography influences the postoperative course. We report a longitudinal echocardiography course including intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography in a cone reconstruction procedure for Ebstein's anomaly in a 17-year-old woman. Tight tricuspid valvuloplasty was preferred, but the tricuspid annulus enlarged rather after surgery. The evaluation of the tricuspid valve form and function using intraoperative echocardiography could support the surgeon's impression.
