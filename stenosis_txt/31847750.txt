Title: Nationwide Trends in Carotid Endarterectomy and Carotid Artery Stenting in the Post-CREST Era.

Abstract: Background and Purpose- The CREST (Carotid Revascularization Endarterectomy Versus Stenting Trial) demonstrated equivalent composite outcomes between carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and carotid artery stenting (CAS) for treating carotid stenosis. We investigated nationwide trends in these procedures and associated periprocedural stroke, myocardial infarction, death, cost, and readmission rates since CREST outcomes were published. Methods- We queried the Nationwide Readmissions Database to identify patients undergoing CEA and CAS for asymptomatic and symptomatic carotid stenosis from 2010 to 2015. Patients were matched based on demographics, comorbidities, and severity of illness. Results- In total, 378 354 CEA and 57 273 CAS patients were treated during this 6-year period. CEA volume decreased by an average of 2669 procedures annually (P=0.001) with stable CAS volume (P=0.225). After matching, CEA patients had a higher rate of periprocedural stroke than CAS patients, driven by increased stroke risk in symptomatic CEA patients (8.1% versus 5.6%; odds ratio, 1.47 [CI, 1.29-1.68]; P&lt;0.001) but a lower rate of overall inpatient mortality (0.8% versus 1.4%; odds ratio, 0.57 [CI, 0.48-0.68]; P&lt;0.001). CEA patients were less likely to be readmitted within 30 days (7.2% versus 8.0%; odds ratio, 0.90 [CI, 0.84-0.96]; P=0.018) and 90 days (12.3% versus 14.1%; odds ratio, 0.86 [CI, 0.81-0.90]; P&lt;0.001), and mean hospital costs were lower for CEA compared with CAS ($14 433 versus $19 172; P&lt;0.001). Conclusions- The procedural treatment of carotid stenosis has changed dramatically in the post-CREST era. When matched for characteristics and illness severity, patients undergoing CEA had a higher rate of perioperative stroke than patients undergoing CAS, primarily among symptomatic patients. These findings are in contrast to the findings of CREST, which showed nearly twice the risk of stroke in CAS patients compared with CEA patients. CEA was associated with lower procedure cost and readmission rate.
