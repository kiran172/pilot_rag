Title: [One-year outcomes of surgical aortic valve replacement: a single, high-volume center experience].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The introduction of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (AVR) mandates attention to outcomes after surgical AVR (SAVR). The aim of this study was to assess 1-year outcomes in a contemporary large cohort of patients undergoing AVR.
METHODS: Data from 520 patients who underwent isolated SAVR between October 2016 and April 2019 were prospectively collected.
RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 72.8 ± 10.1 years and the average EuroSCORE II was 1.8 ± 1.5%. SAVR was performed using minimally invasive approaches (MI-AVR) in 306 patients (58.9%). However, the rate of MI-AVR considerably increased over the observational period from 47.9% to 86.7% (p<0.001). MI-AVR patients received rapid deployment valves in 40% of cases, minimally invasive extracorporeal circulation system in 34.4% and ultra fast track anesthetic management with table extubation in 38.2%. Overall 30-day mortality was 0.4% (n=2). The rates of postoperative stroke and atrioventricular block requiring pacemaker implantation were 0.6% (n=3) and 3.8% (n=20), respectively. At 1 year, the estimated survival, stroke and rehospitalization rates were 97.3%, 1% and 4.5%, respectively. Overall, the estimated incidence of the composite endpoint - death, stroke and rehospitalization - was 7%.
CONCLUSIONS: Contemporary SAVR in a high-volume center yields excellent clinical outcomes with very low mortality and morbidity. In this setting, the extensive use of minimally invasive approaches combined with the modern techniques and technologies demonstrated to improve clinical outcomes and increase patient and family satisfaction.
