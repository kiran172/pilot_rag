Title: Short and Medium Term Outcomes of Open and Laparoscopic Assisted Oesophageal Replacement Procedures.

Abstract: AIM OF THE STUDY: We describe the short- and medium-term outcomes following open and laparoscopic assisted oesophageal replacement surgery in a single tertiary paediatric surgical centre.
METHODS: A retrospective review (institutional audit approval no. 3213) on patients who underwent open or laparoscopic-assisted oesophageal replacement (OAR vs. LAR) at our centre between 2002 and 2021 was completed. Data collected (demographics, early complications, stricture formation, need for oesophageal dilatations, and mortality) were analysed using GraphPad Prism v 9.50 and are presented as median (IQR).
RESULTS: 71 children (37 male) had oesophageal replacement surgery at a median age of 2.3 years (IQR 4.7 years). 51 were LAR (6 conversions). Replacement conduit was stomach (n = 67), colon (n = 3), or jejunum (n = 1). Most gastric transpositions had a pyloroplasty (46/67) or pyloromyotomy (14/67). Most common pathology was oesophageal atresia (n = 50 including 2 failed transpositions), caustic injury (n = 19 including 3 due to button battery), stricture of unknown cause (n = 1), and megaoesophagus (n = 1). There were 2 (2.8 %) early postoperative deaths at 2 days (major vessel thrombosis), 1 month (systemic sepsis), and one death at 5 years in the community. The rate of postoperative complications were comparable across LAR and OAR including anastomotic leak, pleural effusions, or early strictures. More patients with caustic pathology needed dilatations (60 % vs 30 % in OA, p = 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Outcomes of open and laparoscopic-assisted oesophageal replacement procedures are comparable in the short and medium term. Anastomotic stricture is higher in those with caustic injury.
