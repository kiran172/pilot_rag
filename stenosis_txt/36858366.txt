Title: [Application value of image fusion technology in transcatheter aortic valve implantation].

Abstract: Objective: To analysis the application value of image fusion technology in transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Methods: A total of 35 patients underwent trans-femoral TAVI using the first-generation VENUS-A valve in Heart Center of Henan Provincial People's Hospital from January 2020 to May 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. Among them, there were 21 males and 14 females, aged from 64 to 81 years, with a mean (SD) of (71.37±5.66) years. They were divided into conventional group (n=22) and fusion group (n=13), according to whether image fusion technology was used during operation. The preoperative general data, intraoperative data, differences of postoperative renal function and residence time in intensive care unit (ICU) were analyzed and compared between the two groups. The postoperative echocardiography and 12 lead ECG were observed. Results: All 35 patients in this study were with severe aortic stenosis, of which, 10 patients were complicated with moderate to severe regurgitation. Compared with the conventional group, the intraoperative fusion group had fewer angiography times [3.0 (3.0, 4.0) vs 5.0 (5.0, 6.0)], X-ray absorbed dose [342.0 (44.5) mGy vs 388.4 (71.0) mGy], and contrast dosage [(73.5±10.5) ml vs (90.3±10.3) ml], and shorter rapid pacing time [(14.0±1.6) seconds vs (16.5±2.0) seconds] (all P&lt;0.05). There was no significant differences in X-ray irradiation time, operation time, sizing of the pre-dilated balloon, valve implantation depth and other indicators (all P&gt;0.05). There was no significant differences in ICU retention time and postoperative renal function (all P&gt;0.05). Postoperative echocardiography showed that the function of aortic valve was good, with mild perivalvular leakage in 2 cases in the conventional group and 1 case in the fusion group; and one patient was implanted with permanent pacemaker after TAVI in the conventional group. Conclusion: Image fusion technology simplifies the TAVI process, shortens the ventricular pacing time and reduces the dosage of X-ray and contrast, and has certain clinical application value.
