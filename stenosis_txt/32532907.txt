Title: Potential benefit of combination antifungal therapy in Aspergillus endocarditis.

Abstract: Aspergillus endocarditis (AE) is a rare condition with a mortality rate greater than 60%. While it is generally accepted that both antifungal therapy and surgery are necessary for survival, the optimal antifungal regimen is unclear. A 62-year-old man was diagnosed with AE of a prosthetic aortic valve, complicated by cerebral emboli. He underwent debridement of the aortic valve abscess and valve replacement, and was managed with a combination of liposomal amphotericin B and voriconazole for 7â€‰weeks followed by long-term suppressive azole therapy. He remained well at follow-up 18 months later. Data from a review of case reports published between 1950 and 2010 revealed greater survival rates in patients managed with two or more antifungals as opposed to single agent therapy. We provide an updated literature review with similar findings, suggesting that dual agent antifungal therapy should be considered in patients with AE.
