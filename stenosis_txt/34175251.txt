Title: Balloon Post-Dilatation Improves Long-Term Valve Performance After Balloon-Expandable Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The impact of balloon post-dilatation (BPD) on short- and long-term valve performance after Sapien 3 (S3) implantation is unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of balloon post-dilatation (BPD) on short- and long-term valve performance after the implantation of S3.
METHODS: A total of 846 patients implanted with S3 from the OCEAN-TAVI registry were included in this study. The patients were divided into BPD and non-BPD groups. The clinical outcomes and valve functions were compared.
RESULTS: The BPD group included 173 (20.4%) patients and the non-BPD group comprised 673 (79.6%) patients. The prosthesis-patient mismatch (PPM) rates were significantly lower in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group before and after propensity score matching at in-hospital follow-up (before matching: 12 [7.1%] vs. 108 [16.3%], p = 0.002; after matching: 8 [6.3%] vs. 19 [14.8%], p = 0.027) and at 1-year follow-up (before matching: 14 [12.5%] vs. 112 [23.6%], p = 0.010; after matching: 9 [10.5%] vs. 19 [22.1%], p = 0.039). The rates of acute kidney injury, cardiac tamponade, and in-hospital cardiovascular death were significantly higher in the BPD group than in the non-BPD group (acute kidney injury: 22 [12.7%] vs. 33 [4.9%], p < 0.001; cardiac tamponade: 3 [1.7%] vs. 2 [0.3%], p = 0.028; in-hospital cardiovascular death: 4 [2.3%] vs. 3 [0.4%], p = 0.016). After matching, these clinical outcomes were similar between the BPD and non-BPD groups.
CONCLUSIONS: The BPD group demonstrated better short- and long-term valve performance. Caution is needed to avoid procedure-related complications in patients undergoing BPD.
