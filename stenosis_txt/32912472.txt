Title: Spatial Distribution of Vulnerable Plaques: Comprehensive In Vivo Coronary Plaque Mapping.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The authors performed a comprehensive analysis on the distribution of coronary plaques with different phenotypes from our 3-vessel optical coherence tomography (OCT) database.
BACKGROUND: Previous pathology studies demonstrated that thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) is localized in specific segments of the epicardial coronary arteries. A detailed description of in vivo coronary plaques of various phenotypes has not been reported.
METHODS: OCT images of all 3 coronary arteries in 131 patients were analyzed every 1 mm to assess plaque phenotype and features of vulnerability. In addition, plaques were divided into tertiles according to percent area stenosis (%AS).
RESULTS: Among 534 plaques identified in 393 coronary arteries, 27.0% were fibrous plaques, 13.3% were fibrocalcific plaques, 40.8% were thick-cap fibroatheromas, and 18.9% were TCFAs. TCFAs showed clustering in the proximal segment, particularly in the left anterior descending artery. On the other hand, fibrous plaques were relatively evenly distributed throughout the entire length of the coronary arteries. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), TCFAs showed stronger proximal clustering in the left anterior descending, 2 clustering peaks in the right coronary artery, and 1 clustering peak in the circumflex artery. The pattern of TCFA distribution was less obvious in patients without ACS. The prevalence of TCFA was higher in the highest %AS tertile, compared with the lowest %AS tertile (30% vs. 9%; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The present 3-vessel OCT study showed that TCFAs cluster at specific locations in the epicardial coronary arteries, especially in patients with ACS. TCFA was more prevalent in segments with tight stenosis. (The Massachusetts General Hospital Optical Coherence Tomography Registry; NCT01110538).
