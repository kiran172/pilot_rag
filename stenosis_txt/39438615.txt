Title: Effect of castor oil on esophageal stricture in rats and expression of ST-2, neopterin proteins in corrosive burn model.

Abstract: Corrosive esophageal burn (CEB) is a disease with high mortality and morbidity rates. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of castor oil, in preventing stricture development at the experimental CEB model. In addition to studying standard histopathological damage data, neopterin, IL-33, and ST-2 proteins were also studied for the first time. Fifty Wistar-Albino rats were divided into randomized 5 groups. [Sham group (G1) (n:10), Control group (G2) (n:10), Early Stage Topical Application group (G3)(n:10), Late Stage Topical Application group (G4) (n:10), Oral Application group (G5) (n:10)]. Weight measurement, esophageal length, histopathological damage score (HDS) and total stenosis score (TSS), tissue caspase-3 and VEGF staining, tissue hydroxyproline (HYP), blood TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-33, Neopterin, and ST-2 levels were measured. In the castor oil application groups, weight gain was observed, the acute phase reaction decreased, submucosal/tunica muscularis fibrosis (TMF) and muscularis mucosal damage (MMD) were reduced, and TSS and HDS decreased. While no significant difference was detected in the ST-2 protein, which was used for the first time in this study model, a significant increase in neopterin protein was observed in the application groups. Results indicate the nutritional contribution of castor oil, as well as its tissue healing and esophageal stricture-preventing efficacy at histopathological and immune-histochemical levels.
