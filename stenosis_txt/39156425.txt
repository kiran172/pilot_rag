Title: When Revascularization May Be Appropriate in Atherosclerotic Renal Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: Renal artery stenosis (RAS) is a condition that involves the narrowing of one or both renal arteries, most commonly caused by either atherosclerosis or fibroplasia. RAS can present in a multitude of clinical manifestations involving hypertension (HTN), heart failure, and renal failure. Current recommendations for treating patients with RAS involve strict medical therapyÂ often without invasive therapies. However, in more complicated patients with RAS, recent clinical studies and guidelines have offered varying recommendations, which has presented challenges in managing these cases. This review aims to summarize current evidence to best evaluate which patients with RAS may benefit from renal artery revascularization as opposed to medical therapy alone.
