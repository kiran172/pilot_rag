Title: A Case of Pharyngeal Stenosis Caused by Behçet's Disease Treated With Transoral Videolaryngoscopic Surgery.

Abstract: Behçet's disease is a refractory inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent oral aphthous ulcers. Ulcers are commonly seen in the oral cavity and the pharyngeal region. In patients with recurrent pharyngeal ulcers, pharyngeal stenosis may occur and leads to dysphagia. Herein, we report a case of pharyngeal stenosis caused by recurrent ulcers due to incomplete Behçet's disease. Prednisolone, colchicine, and infliximab were administered and resolved the pharyngeal ulcers, however, dysphagia persisted. To improve the swallowing function, a pharyngeal dilation surgery and transoral videolaryngoscopic surgery were performed, which resulted in an enlarged pharyngeal cavity. Oral intake of water was initiated the day after surgery, and after six days, the patient was able to take a normal diet. The pharyngeal stenosis had not recurred for one year after the surgery, and a normal diet continued without any dietary restrictions. Therefore, in a case of a severe oropharyngeal lesion, periodic follow-up and surgical interventions by an otolaryngologist are necessary.
