Title: Does leptin cause proximal gastric cancer in the obese? The role of serum leptin in the etiology of proximal gastric cancer.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine the correlation between obesity, serum levels of leptin and proximal gastric cancer.
METHODS: Sixty-four gastric cancer patients operated on with curative intent were included in the study. We determined the correlation between the preoperative serum levels of leptin and the tumor's location.
RESULTS: Serum leptin levels were correlated significantly with the proximal third location (p=0.04), gastric outlet obstructing tumors (p<0.0001), CRP levels (p=0.03) and BMI (p<0.0001). Patients with high serum levels of leptin had significantly more intestinal types of gastric cancer (p=0.033) and better differentiation (p=0.009). The linear regression model determined the proximal tumor location (beta: 0.467; p=0.045), BMI (beta: 0.657; p=0.001), high preoperative serum albumin (beta: 0.563; p=0.016) and the presence of pyloric stenosis (beta: 0.525; p=0.006) as related significantly to serum leptin levels. The Cox proportional hazard model identified age (HR: 0.003; 95 % CI: 0-0.794; p=0.041), preoperative serum levels of leptin (HR: 0.125; 95 % CI: 0.018-0.887; p=0.037) and the number of extracted LNs (HR: 0.001; 95 % CI: 0-0.677; p=0.038) as independent prognostic factors.
CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of leptin were significantly elevated in patients with proximal gastric cancer, suggesting that the leptin's effect might be due to its systemic secretion. This might explain the higher incidence of proximal gastric cancer in obese patients. Elevated serum leptin levels were an independent prognostic factor.
