Title: History of Carotid Artery Reconstruction around the World and in Japan.

Abstract: Since ancient times, physicians have been aware of correlations between the carotid artery and consciousness; however, carotid stenosis was only recently identified as the cause of atherothrombotic ischemic stroke. In 1658, Wepfer described the first suggestion of a link between symptoms of cerebral arterial insufficiency and carotid pathology. In 1951, Fisher reported details of the symptoms and pathological findings and emphasized that cervical atheromatous lesions induced cerebral infarction with various symptoms. The beginning of carotid artery surgery was ligation of the carotid artery for neck or head injury, but surgeons were aware that this operation induced cerebral symptoms due to lack of blood supply. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) was first reported by Eastcott et al. in 1954, and in Japan, Kimoto performed a successful CEA in 1962. In 1979, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was performed for patients with fibromuscular dysplasia, and then, carotid artery stenting (CAS) was first performed in 1989 by Mathias. In Japan, Kuwana et al. were the first to perform carotid PTA, in 1981, whereas Yamashita et al. performed the first CAS in 1997. Yoshimura et al. proposed staged carotid stenting to prevent hyperperfusion syndrome. Some issues in carotid reconstruction are still debated today, which include conventional (standard) CEA versus the eversion technique, CEA versus CAS versus medical therapy, and medical economic problems. In the future, we must continue to develop more effective, safer, and less expensive therapeutic methods to prevent carotid stroke, carrying on the efforts of the ancient peoples who pioneered this research.
