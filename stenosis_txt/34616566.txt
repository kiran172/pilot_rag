Title: Visualization of the renal artery in kidney transplant patients using time-resolved computed tomography angiography.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS) is a post-operative complication which most often occurs between 3 months and 2 years after transplantation. TRAS is associated with kidney failure and hypertension and, thereby, with an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this retrospective study was to report our experience of perfusion computed tomography angiography (P-CTA) to identify a 50% lumen reduction (as compared to digital subtraction angiography, DSA), assess its subjective image quality and evaluate if contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) occurred.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: All 13 patients who had undergone P-CTA for suspected TRAS at our institution were retrospectively evaluated. At P-CTA, eight or 12 g of iodine were administered intravenously, and five to seven scan sequences were merged into time-resolved images after motion correction. Eight patients underwent subsequent DSA.
RESULTS: The average patient weight was 76 kg (range 55-97 kg). Image quality was rated as good or excellent for all patients, and pathological changes were shown in 10 of 13 patients undergoing P-CTA. Two patients had a serum creatinine increase of &gt;26 μmol/L during the first 3 days, but serum creatinine was significantly lower in all patients 1 month after P-CTA (165+/-69 μmol/L versus 232+/-66 μmol/L, P &lt; .01). The diagnosis at P-CTA was verified in all eight patients who underwent DSA. However, in two cases with suspected stenosis, renal function was restored without angioplasty.
CONCLUSION: Anatomy and blood flow of the transplant renal artery can be visualized using less than a third of the standard contrast media dose by using P-CTA technique.
