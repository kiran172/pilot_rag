Title: [Ureteroplasty using onlay graft for long ureteral strictures].

Abstract: Full-text articles published in peer-reviewed journals dedicated to the results of onlay ureteroplasty using various materials, as well as monographs on surgical treatment of long ureteral strictures are presented in the article. Over the past decade, onlay technique for the treatment of long ureteral strictures using flaps or grafts on a vascular pedicle have been introduced. Experimental data on the results of onlay ureteroplasty using autologous vein or bladder mucosa, as well as the small intestine submucosa (SIS) have been published in the literature. Due to the availability and good survival rate, buccal and tongue mucosal flaps are widely recognized as the optimal graft for onlay ureteroplasty. There are also studies on the results of ureteroplasty using SIS or appendix graft onlay for the upper and middle ureteral strictures. A use of tissue-engineered flaps for ureteroplasty remains contradictory. Further research in this direction may allow to obtain optimal grafts for onlay ureteroplasty. However, oral mucosa or appendix are predominant materials, which are used for onlay ureteroplasty.
