Title: Estimation of venous sinus pressure drop in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension using 4D-flow MRI.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: We aimed to explore a non-invasive estimate of pressure drop in patients who undergo venous sinus stenting to treat idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH).
METHODS: This prospective study included 28 IIH patients scheduled for venous stenting. 4D-flow MRI was acquired 24-48 h before venous manometry. Manometry-obtained pressure drop (Mp) was dichotomized into low (Lp: 0-8 mmHg) and high (Hp: 8-30 mmHg) groups. Hemodynamic indices were compared between Lp and Hp. Trans-stenotic pressure drop was estimated by work-energy equation, simplified Bernoulli equation, vorticity magnitude, and velocity difference between inlet and outlet and was compared with Mp. Measurement agreement, correlation, and accuracy were evaluated using the κ coefficient, Pearson's r, and confusion matrix-derived accuracy.
RESULTS: Among 28 patients (mean age 38.8 ± 12.7), 19 (67.9%) were female. Work-energy equation-estimated pressure drop (WEp) had strong correlation (r = 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.81-0.96, p &lt; 0.001) and high agreement (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78-0.95, p &lt; 0.001) with Mp. WEp classified Lp and Hp with an accuracy of 0.96. The κ value between WEp and Mp was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.78-1.00). In the work-energy equation, the viscosity energy term (V<sub>e</sub>) had the largest weights, and the ratio of V<sub>e</sub> to the summation of the three energy terms was 0.93 ± 0.07. V<sub>e</sub> had strong correlation with mVort (r = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.85-0.97, p &lt; 0.001), and mean vorticity magnitude was significantly elevated in Hp compared to that in Lp (259.8 vs. 174.9 mL/s, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Trans-stenotic pressure drop in IIH can be estimated using the work-energy equation with favorable accuracy.
KEY POINTS: • Trans-stenotic pressure drop in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension can be estimated accurately with the work-energy equation using the 4D-flow MRI full velocity field. • Compared with traditional venous sinus manometry, the 4D-flow MRI-derived pressure drop is totally non-invasive and cost-saving. • 4D-flow MRI may help neurointerventionalist to select IIH patients suitable for venous sinus stenting.
