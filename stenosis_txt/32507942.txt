Title: Utility of angiography-physiology coregistration maps during percutaneous coronary intervention in clinical practice.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the utility and feasibility of physiological maps coregistered with angiograms using the pullback of a pressure guidewire with continuous instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) measurements. iFR pullback was obtained for 70 lesions from 70 patients with stable angina pectoris using SyncVision (Philips Corp.). Physiological maps were created, whereby the post-intervention iFR (post-iFR) was predicted as iFRpred. The iFR gap was defined if the difference between the iFRpred and post-iFR was ≥ 0.3. The lesion morphology changed from that during the physiological assessment to that during the angiographic assessment in 26 lesions (37.1%). In particular, 22.6% of angiographic tandem lesions changed to physiological focal lesions. The mean pre-intervention iFR, post-iFR, and iFRpred were 0.73 ± 0.17, 0.90 ± 0.06, and 0.93 ± 0.05, respectively. The mean difference between the iFRpred and post-iFR was 0.029 ± 0.099, with 95% limits of agreement of -0.070-0.128. iFR gaps occurred in 28 patients (40%). Notably, a new iFR gradient causing a ≥ 0.03 iFR drop after stenting occurred in 11 (15.7%) cases. The study patients were divided into two groups according to biases between post-iFR and iFRpred < 0.03 (good concordance group) or ≥ 0.03 (poor concordance group). The pre-intervention heart rate was the only independent predictor of poor concordance (odds ratio, 0.936; 95% confidence interval 0.883-0.992; p = 0.027). Physiological maps under resting conditions may contribute to a reduction in unnecessary stent placements without missing lesions requiring treatment. However, the predictive accuracy of post-iFR performance in the present study was slightly lower than that in the previous reports.
