Title: Impact of New York Heart Association Functional Class on Outcomes After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In the current guidelines, indications for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) are expanded to include several subgroups of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS), and there is a paucity of data on the prognostic impact of New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class in patients with severe AS undergoing TAVI.
METHODS: Among 2588 patients enrolled in the OCEAN-TAVI registry, patients were divided into 4 groups according to baseline NYHA class (class I in 95 patients, class II in 1172 patients, class III in 1126 patients, and class IV in 195 patients).
RESULTS: Median follow-up was 729 days. The cumulative 2-year incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in patients with NYHA class IV and III than in those with NYHA class II and I. (30.0%, 21.3%, 13.4%, and 11.2%, respectively, P < 0.001). After adjusting confounders, NYHA class IV and III, but not NYHA class II were independently associated with higher mortality compared with NYHA class I (reference) (adjusted HR: 3.43, 95%CI: 1.83-7.15, P < 0.001; adjusted HR: 2.07, 95%CI: 1.15-4.19, P = 0.013; and adjusted HR: 1.50, 95%CI: 0.83-3.04, P = 0.19, respectively). With increasing NYHA class, there was an incremental increase of heart failure hospitalization in the effect size relative to the reference (NYHA class I).
CONCLUSIONS: The long-term outcomes of patients with NYHA class I were better than those with NYHA class IV or III in some selected patients undergoing TAVI.
