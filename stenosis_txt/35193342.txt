Title: [Perioperative management of cochlear implantation for CHARGE syndrome].

Abstract: Objective:To explore the perioperative period characteristics of paediatric cochlear implant recipients of CHARGE syndrome with complex deformities. Methods:Retrospective case series of CHARGE syndrome were included. Radiological results, intraoperative findings, surgical planning and post-operative complications were analyzed. Routine audiometric measurements, speech perception categories and speech intelligibility ratings were performed pre and post-operatively to measure auditory speech rehabilitation outcomes. Results:Five prelingual profoundly deaf children were identified, aged from 14 months to 60 months. All patients had congenital heart disease and underwent surgery before cochlear implantation. Upper airway abnormalities were detected as choanal atresia, laryngomalacia and tracheal stenosis. All ten ears showed cochlear abnormalities（Incomplete partition Ⅱ）, eight of them combined with secretory otitis media and/or middle ear deformity. All patients underwent single side surgery using standard transmastoid facial recess approach. Full insertion of the electrode was achieved in two cochleas, while partial insertion was done in three cochleas. Three ears with absent auditory nerves in MRI showed no response in the neural remote test. All patients had improved audio-speech performance with CAP scores 3.0±0.7 and 3.6±0.9, SIR scores 1.2±0.4 and 1.8±0.8, IT-MAIS scores 18.8±9.1 and 26.2±10.0, MUSS scores 2.2±2.4 and 7.2±8.3 after twelve months and twenty-four months follow up. Conclusion:Cochlear implantation in patients with CHARGE syndrome is a challenge in both its surgical and rehabilitation aspects due to multiple abnormalities. Adequate treatment planning is necessary for safe and effective surgery, including airway structures and intricate temporal bone landmarks.
