Title: Balloon dilatation is superior to CO<sub>2</sub> laser excision in the treatment of subglottic stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Endoscopic treatment of subglottic stenosis (SGS) is regarded as a safe procedure with rare complications and less morbidity than open surgery yet related with a high risk of recurrence. The abundance of techniques and adjuvant therapies complicates a comparison of the different surgical approaches. The primary aim of this study was to investigate disease recurrence after CO<sub>2</sub> laser excisions and balloon dilatation in patients with SGS and to identify potential confounding factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a tertiary referral center, two cohorts of previously undiagnosed patients treated for SGS were retrospectively reviewed and followed for 3 years. The CO<sub>2</sub> laser cohort (CLC) was recruited between 2006 and 2011, and the balloon dilatation cohort (BDC) between 2014 and 2019. Kaplan‒Meier and multivariable Cox regression analyzed time to repeated surgery and estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for different variables.
RESULTS: Nineteen patients were included in the CLC, and 31 in the BDC. The 1-year cumulative recurrence risk was 63.2% for the CLC compared with 12.9% for the BDC (HR 33.0, 95% CI 6.57-166, p < 0.001), and the 3-year recurrence risk was 73.7% for the CLC compared with 51.6% for the BDC (HR 8.02, 95% CI 2.39-26.9, p < 0.001). Recurrence was independently associated with overweight (HR 3.45, 95% CI 1.16-10.19, p = 0.025), obesity (HR 7.11, 95% CI 2.19-23.04, p = 0.001), and younger age at diagnosis (HR 8.18, 95% CI 1.43-46.82, p = 0.018).
CONCLUSION: CO<sub>2</sub> laser treatment is associated with an elevated risk for recurrence of SGS compared with balloon dilatation. Other risk factors include overweight, obesity, and a younger age at diagnosis.
