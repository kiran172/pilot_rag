Title: Large artery intracranial stenosis in young adults with ischaemic stroke.

Abstract: Large artery intracranial stenosis (ICS) is a common finding in stroke patients, but is much less prevalent in Western countries than in Asia and in young adults than in the elderly. We investigated the prevalence and causes of ICS among French young adults with ischaemic stroke. Clinical and radiological data of patients aged 18-54 years treated consecutively for acute ischaemic stroke in the anterior circulation at a tertiary stroke centre were analysed retrospectively. Patients with>50% ICS were identified. ICS was evaluated using TOF-MRA, vessel wall-MRI, digital subtraction angiography and CT-angiography. A total of 316 patients were included. ICS was diagnosed in 29 patients, resulting in a prevalence of 9.2% (95% CI, 6.2 to 13.3). The leading cause of ICS was atherosclerosis (n=13), ahead of moyamoya disease (n=4), dissection (n=2), vasculitis (n=2), and reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome (n=1). The cause of ICAS could not be determined in 7 patients. ICS was found in nearly one in 10 ischaemic strokes among French young adults. Atherosclerosis was the leading cause of ICS. The cause of ICS could not be determined in almost a quarter of the patients.
