Title: The clinical usefulness of phase analysis in detecting coronary artery disease using dipyridamole thallium-201-gated myocardial perfusion imaging with a cadmium-zinc-telluride camera.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Previous studies have demonstrated left ventricular mechanical dyssynchrony (LVMD) in patients with severe coronary artery disease (CAD) with ≥ 70% stenosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical usefulness of stress/rest LVMD in the diagnosis of CAD with ≥ 50% stenosis using dipyridamole thallium-201 (Tl-201) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) with a cadmium-zinc-telluride camera.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 476 patients without known CAD who underwent dipyridamole Tl-201 MPI and coronary angiography within 6 months were retrospectively reviewed. LVMD parameters including phase standard deviation and phase histogram bandwidth, phase skewness and phase kurtosis, as well as myocardial perfusion and myocardial stunning were assessed in post-stress and rest MPI. Relationships between the presence of CAD on coronary angiography and single photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) parameters were evaluated. The presence of perfusion abnormalities was the best diagnostic tool in detecting CAD. Although less left ventricular synchrony was observed post-stress in the CAD group compared to the non-CAD group, no significant dyssynchrony was noted.
CONCLUSIONS: The addition of phase analysis to help diagnose CAD in Tl-201-gated SPECT with dipyridamole stress may have limited value in patients with CAD with ≥ 50% stenosis.
