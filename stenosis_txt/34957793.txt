Title: Immediate postoperative interventional therapy for neurologic salvage when cerebral thromboembolism complicates carotid endarterectomy.

Abstract: Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) continues to be one of the most important medical and social problems in our country. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the standard and effective surgical treatment for AIS prevention in patients with significant carotid artery stenosis. Even though CEA is a safe procedure when performed by an experienced surgeon, it is still associated with risks of operative complications inherent to any surgical intervention. Therefore, immediate postoperative appropriate adjuvant or neurological salvage therapy for AIS patients after CEA is necessary. In this study,we report three patients in our institution who received immediate post-operative interventional therapy for neurological salvage, in the setting of cerebral embolism after CEA.
