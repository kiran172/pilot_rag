Title: Dural sinus septum as an underlying cause of intrinsic venous sinus stenosis: Anatomical, clinical, and stent placement considerations.

Abstract: Recently, an interesting study regarding "Dural sinus septum: an underlying cause of cerebral venous sinus stenting failure and complications." was published, to our knowledge, being the launching point of the clinical/interventional applications of this intraluminal variation. Herein, we wish to highlight paramount anatomical, clinical, and stent placement considerations related to DSS located in the dural venous sinus at the posterior cranial fossa and the interventional complications caused by the presence of this variation during stenting procedures.
