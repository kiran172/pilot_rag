Title: The value of somatosensory evoked potentials in intraoperative evaluation of indirect decompression effect of oblique lumbar interbody fusion for lumbar spinal stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between intraoperative somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) amplitude changes and clinical outcomes of OLIF indirect decompression for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS).
METHODS: A prospective study was performed on 201 patients who received oblique lumbar interbody fusion (OLIF) in our hospital from July 2017 to May 2021 due to single segmental DLSS. The patients were divided into three groups: group A (mild DLSS), group B (moderate DLSS), and group C (severe DLSS). The P40 amplitude during operation were recorded, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated by JOA score 1 year postoperative. ROC curves for satisfactory efficacy of P40 amplitude improvement rate and CSA improvement rate were established. Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationship between P40 improvement rate and JOA improvement rate.
RESULTS: In group A and group B, the improvement rate of JOA in P40 significantly improved group was significantly greater that in improved group and unimproved group (P<sub>a</sub> = 0.009; P<sub>b</sub> &lt; 0.000). No significant among-subgroup differences in group C (all P &gt; 0.05). In both groups A and B, there was a significant difference in the improvement rate of P40 amplitude between the satisfactory group and the ineffective group (P<sub>a</sub> = 0.013; P<sub>b</sub> = 0.001), while in group C, there was no statistical significance (P<sub>c</sub> = 0.107). By variable Person correlation analysis, a significant positive correlation was obtained between JOA improvement rate and P40 amplitude improvement rate in groups A and B (r<sub>1</sub> = 0.27, P<sub>1</sub> = 0.02; r<sub>2</sub> = 0.508, P<sub>2</sub> = 0.001), no correlation between the two in group C (r<sub>3</sub> = 0.243, P<sub>3</sub> = 0.056). The area under the ROC for assessing surgical efficacy in terms of CSA improvement rate was 0.813 (95% CI: 0.737-0.889, P &lt; 0.001) and 0.767 (95% CI: 0.677-0.856, P &lt; 0.001) in group A and group B, respectively, with satisfactory efficacy cutoff points of 50.18% and 67.89%.
CONCLUSION: For mild and moderate DLSS, the intraoperative P40 amplitude improvement rate can predict the improvement of clinical symptoms after surgery and can be used as a reference index to assess the effect of indirect decompression. For severe DLSS, the P40 amplitude improvement rate has limited significance in guiding indirect decompression, and OLIF indirect decompression is not the right treatment for this type of patients.
