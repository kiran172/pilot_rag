Title: Percutaneous Bailout Technique for Trapping an Embolized Valve During Valve-in-Valve TAVR.

Abstract: A complex 15-year treatment history of a 75-year-old man with New York Heart Association class III symptoms is presented via images and video. His treatment history was noteworthy of bicuspid aortic valve (AV) and a ventricular septal defect (VSD), for which he had an AV replacement and VSD closure in 2005. In 2015, he underwent redo AV replacement and root reconstruction. Echocardiography demonstrated severe bioprosthetic AV stenosis and moderate AV regurgitation. Valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement with a Sentinel cerebral protection device was recommended. Pre-operative computed tomography scan showed dilated aortic root and descending aorta with evidence of pseudocoarcta- tion. This case highlights the need for multidisciplinary team approach and the in-depth knowledge of various devices and techniques available.
