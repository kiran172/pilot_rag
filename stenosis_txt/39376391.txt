Title: "Thai Noodle": A Novel Technique for Post Radiation Choanal Stenosis.

Abstract: The aim of this retrospective study is to describe a novel endoscopic technique to treat post radiation choanal stenosis. We describe a novel "Thai noodle" silastic splint, which is tailor-made, increases compliance, reduces pain and recurrence. A retrospective study over a period of 2 years was done to evaluate the results of our "Thai noodle" technique, which included 4 patients who had previously been treated with conventional endoscopic release and commercially available nasal airway splint. All patients were followed up for a period of 1 year. All 4 patients, which included 3 females and 1 male, were treated with our novel technique. All the patients remained symptom free and none required further intervention. The Thai noodle technique customises the splint for every patient, which along with an adequately done posterior septectomy increases patient comfort and reduces recurrence which is seen with conventional airway splints.
