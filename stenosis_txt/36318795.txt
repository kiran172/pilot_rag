Title: Long-Gap Esophageal Atresia Repair Using Staged Thoracoscopic Internal Traction: The First Kazakhstan Experience.

Abstract: Introduction: The treatment of long-gap esophageal atresia (LGEA) remains an important issue for pediatric surgeons. There are several methods of treating LGEA with various advantages and disadvantages. Thoracoscopic esophageal elongation using internal traction sutures has been developed more recently. Therefore, we wanted to report on our first experience in treating such pathology using staged thoracoscopic internal traction. Objective: To share our first experience in the treatment of LGEA using staged thoracoscopic internal traction. Methods: Three children with LGEA were treated at the University Medical Center "National Scientific Center for Maternal and Child Health" in the Pediatric Surgery Department, Nur-Sultan, Kazakhstan, using the method of staged thoracoscopic internal traction. Results: At the age of 3-4 months, 3 patients were operated on successfully using staged thoracoscopic internal traction. In any case, converting to an open thoracotomy was not needed and no anastomotic leakage was observed. In 2 cases, stenosis occurred that was treated by dilatation at least twice, 1 child had no stenosis. Conclusions: Thoracoscopic internal traction technique for LGEA was performed for the first time in Kazakhstan that showed its safety and possible future use in the surgical treatment of this congenital malformation.
