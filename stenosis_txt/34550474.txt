Title: Associated factors of patients with spinal stenosis who undergo reoperation after a posterior lumbar spinal fusion in a Hispanic-American population.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated factors of patients with LSS who undergo reoperation after a PLSF in a Hispanic-American population.
METHODS: A retrospective single-center review was performed from all non-age-related Hispanic-Americans with LSS who underwent one or two-level PLSF from 2008 to 2018. Baseline characteristics were analyzed between the reoperation and no-reoperation group using a bivariate and multivariate analyses.
RESULTS: Out of 425 patients who underwent PLSF, 38 patients underwent reoperation. At a two-year follow-up, the reoperation rate was 6.1% (26/425), mostly due to pseudoarthrosis (39.5%), recurrent stenosis (26.3%), new condition (15.8%), infection (10.5%), hematoma (5.3%), and dural tear (2.6%). Patients who underwent reoperation were more likely to have a preoperative history of epidural steroid injection (ESI) (OR 5.18, P = 0.009), four or more comorbidities (OR 2.69, P = 0.028), and operated only with a posterolateral fusion without intervertebral fusion (OR 2.15, P = 0.032). Finally, the multivariable analysis showed that ESI was the only independent associated factor in patients who underwent reoperation after a PLSF in our group.
CONCLUSION: Among this population who underwent surgery, a reoperation rate at two years of follow-up was less than ten percent. Our study did not find any associated factor inherent to Hispanic-Americans, as ethnic group, who were reoperated after LSS.
