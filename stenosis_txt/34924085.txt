Title: "Half-uncovered technique" to secure larger stents for postoperative pulmonary vein stenosis.

Abstract: Although larger stent placement could be effective for pulmonary vein stenosis, stents extrusion tends to occur due to caliber narrowing, small landing area, and the slippery nature. We placed stents with diameter â‰§8 mm for four stenotic lesions using the "half-uncovered technique". All stents were precisely placed and successfully resolved the stenosis. This technique allows us to avoid extrusion and to perform safe and effective dilatation when placing larger stents for pulmonary vein stenosis.
