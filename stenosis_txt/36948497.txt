Title: Opioid-free mastectomy under thoracic epidural anesthesia-analgesia in a patient with critical tracheal stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: Mastectomy is traditionally performed under general anaesthesia and invasive ventilation, and is often complemented with regional techniques. In this setting, tracheal stenosis can pose a challenge to airway management. The aim of this report is to describe the successful management of a 68-year-old woman with severe subglottic tracheal stenosis undergoing mastectomy due to breast cancer. Surgery was performed without airway instrumentation under an opioid-free regimen consisting of thoracic epidural, propofol and dexmedetomidine perfusion, and non-opioid analgesics. Spontaneous ventilation and adequate perioperative analgesia were achieved. Opioid-free anaesthesia without airway instrumentation, consisting of thoracic epidural anaesthesia and sedation, is a good alternative in patients undergoing mastectomy in whom airway manipulation is best avoided.
