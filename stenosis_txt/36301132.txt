Title: Repair of a stenotic bicuspid aortic valve by extensive leaflet shaving and commissuroplasty.

Abstract: The surgical repair of the bicuspid aortic valve in children has been shown to have good outcomes. The repair can be done by the delicate use of native valve tissue without using patch material. The patient is an 8-year-old boy diagnosed with a stenotic bicuspid aortic valve and supravalvular aortic stenosis. He had a balloon valvuloplasty when he was 6 years old. This video tutorial gives detailed information on how to repair the aortic valve by reshaping the aortic cusps and reconstructing the aortic commissures.
