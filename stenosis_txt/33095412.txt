Title: Choice of bronchoscopic intervention working channel for benign central airway stenosis.

Abstract: The purpose of this study is to report our experiences over 12 years with bronchoscopic interventions in patients with benign central airway stenosis using three types of working channels (rigid bronchoscope, laryngeal mask, and endotracheal intubation), with a focus on their related advantages, disadvantages, and postoperative complications. We analyzed the clinical data from 273 patients with benign central airway stenosis who underwent a bronchoscopic intervention. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to analyze the immediate results after the first bronchoscopic intervention, and the Chi-square test was used to analyze the correlation between glottic edema and operation time. The 273 patients underwent a total of 479 bronchoscopic interventions, with satisfactory results. The immediate effective rates of the first bronchoscopic intervention by rigid bronchoscope, laryngeal mask, and endotracheal intubation were 91.4%, 91.3%, and 85.2%, respectively. Postoperative complications related to the working channels included hoarseness, glottic edema, pharyngalgia, paresthesia pharynges, cough, and tooth loss. Glottic edema was the most serious complication, and it occurred in 37.7% (23/61) of the rigid bronchoscope group and 9.8% (32/326) in the laryngeal mask group. And the incidence rate was significantly correlated with the operation time (P < 0.01). Therefore, for patients with benign central airway stenosis, the best choice of working channel during an operation should be made by the operation procedure, lesion location, and pathology of the patients. Shortening the operation time was an important factor in preventing glottic edema.
