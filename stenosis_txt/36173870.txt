Title: Left main coronary disease: evolving management concepts.

Abstract: Remarkable advances in the management of coronary artery disease have enhanced our approach to left main coronary artery (LMCA) disease. The traditional role of coronary artery bypass graft surgery has been challenged by the less invasive percutaneous coronary interventional approach. Additionally, major strides in optimal medical therapy now provide a rich menu of treatment choices in selected circumstances. Although a LMCA stenosis >70% is an acceptable threshold for revascularization, those patients with a LMCA narrowing between 40 and 69% present a more complex scenario. This review examines the relative merits of the different treatment options, addresses key diagnostic and therapeutic unknowns, and identifies future work likely to advance progress.
