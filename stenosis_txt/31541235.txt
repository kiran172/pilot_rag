Title: The Role of Immunomodulators and Biologics in the Medical Management of Stricturing Crohn's Disease.

Abstract: Crohn's disease is a progressive and disabling inflammatory disease involving the gastrointestinal tract. It usually produces inflammatory lesions in the ileocolonic region, but up to half of patients will also develop complications such as strictures in the long term. Indeed, a proportion of patients have progression of the disease with the development of stricturing lesions because there are no drugs that effectively prevent or reverse established fibrosis, and hence these patients are usually treated with surgery or endoscopic balloon dilation. Fibrotic lesions are always associated with some degree of inflammatory changes, but there is little evidence supporting the use of medical therapy in this context. Here, we discuss the most important findings on the possible use of immunomodulators or biologics in the prevention and treatment of intestinal strictures in Crohn's disease patients. Recent evidence demonstrates that these drugs may also be effective in treating lesions with high levels of collagen deposition, and thus might, at least in some patients, reduce the progression of the disease and bowel damage, and further avoid the need for surgery and a disabling course in the long term.
