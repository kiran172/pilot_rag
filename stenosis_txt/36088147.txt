Title: Surgical repair of peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis: A 2-decade experience with 145 patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis (PPAS) is a relatively rare form of congenital heart disease often associated with Williams syndrome, Alagille syndrome, and elastin arteriopathy. This disease is characterized by stenoses at nearly all lobar and segmental ostia and results in systemic-level right ventricular pressures. The current study summarizes our experience with the surgical treatment of PPAS.
METHODS: This was a retrospective review of 145 patients who underwent surgical repair of PPAS. This included 43 patients with Williams syndrome, 39 with Alagille syndrome, and 21 with elastin arteriopathy. Other diagnoses include tetralogy of Fallot with PPAS (n = 21), truncus arteriosus (n = 5), transposition (n = 3), double-outlet right ventricle (n = 2), arterial tortuosity syndrome (n = 3), and other (n = 8).
RESULTS: The median preoperative right ventricle to aortic peak systolic pressure ratio was 1.01 (range, 0.50-1.60) which was reduced to 0.30 (range, 0.17-0.60) postoperatively. The median number of ostial repairs was 17 (range, 6-34) and median duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 398 minutes (range, 92-844). There were 3 in-hospital deaths (2.1%). The median duration of follow-up was 26 months (range, 1-220) with 4 late deaths (2.9%). Eighty-two patients have subsequently undergone catheterization and 74 had a pressure ratio <0.50.
CONCLUSIONS: The surgical treatment of PPAS resulted in a 70% reduction in right ventricular pressures. At 3 years, freedom from death was 94% and 90% of those evaluated maintained low pressures. These results suggest that the surgical treatment of PPAS is highly effective in most patients.
