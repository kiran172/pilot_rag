Title: Asymptomatic stenosis of a celiacomesenteric trunk.

Abstract: Celiacomesenteric trunk is a rare variant of celiac artery anatomical variations. Stenosis of celiacomesenteric trunk is a severe usually symptomatic condition which might jeopardize the arterial supply of both supramesocolic organs and the midgut. It was diagnosed in a 79-year-old male during the preoperative workup for a pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Highly developed arterial anastomotic arcades, and mainly Riolan arcade, allowed to bypass this stenosis and to avoid digestive ischemia. Arterial anastomotic arcades are of paramount interest to ensure sufficient supply to the corresponding organs and must be thoroughly evaluated before planned surgery to avoid postoperative ischemia.
