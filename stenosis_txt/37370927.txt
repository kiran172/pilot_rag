Title: Is Panenteric PillcamTM Crohn's Capsule Endoscopy Ready for Widespread Use? A Narrative Review.

Abstract: Patients diagnosed with Crohn's disease are increasingly subjected to repeat colonoscopic and radiological examinations to assess the extent of the disease severity and the effects of treatment. PillcamTM Crohn's video capsule, a modified colon capsule, was developed to generate a minimally invasive mouth to rectum video of the gastrointestinal tract. The capsule provides a wide-angle panoramic mucosal view to assess inflammation, ulceration, stenosis, disease extent, and effect of treatment. This review summarizes the evidence of its utility in both adult and paediatric Crohn's disease and reviews the scoring systems used to quantify findings. The literature survey indicates that the PillcamTM Crohn's capsule offers high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of inflammatory lesions and the extent and distribution of disease, and it could be considered a reliable imaging modality in both adults and childhood with Crohn's disease.
