Title: Enhancement of Biofunctionalization by Loading Manuka Oil on TiO<sub>2</sub> Nanotubes.

Abstract: Metallic implants (mesh) for guided bone regeneration can result in foreign body reactions with surrounding tissues, infection, and inflammatory reactions caused by micro-organisms in the oral cavity after implantation. This study aimed to reduce the possibility of surgical failure caused by microbial infection by loading antibacterial manuka oil in a biocompatible nanostructure surface on Ti and to induce stable bone regeneration in the bone defect. The manuka oil from New Zealand consisted of a rich Î²-triketone chemotype, leptospermone, which showed strong inhibitory effects against several bacteria, even at very low oil concentrations. The TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubular layer formed by anodization effectively enhanced the surface hydrophilicity, bioactivity, and fast initial bone regeneration. A concentration of manuka oil in the range of 0.02% to less than 1% can have a synergistic effect on antibacterial activity and excellent biocompatibility. A manuka oil coating (especially with a concentration of 0.5%) on the TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotube layer can be expected not only to prevent stenosis of the connective tissue around the mesh and inflammation by microbial infection but also to be effective in stable and rapid bone regeneration.
