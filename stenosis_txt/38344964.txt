Title: [Bilateral stenting for malignant tracheal and bronchial stenosis].

Abstract: Malignant lesions of tracheal bifurcation usually lead to respiratory failure and risk of mortality. Airway stenting is the only minimally invasive method for these patients. The authors present a patient with T4N3M0 left-sided lung cancer (inoperable stage IIIc) complicated by respiratory failure due to tracheal bifurcation obstruction. Bilateral stenting by self-expanding stents with perforated coatings was effective for airway recanalization and provided subsequent chemotherapy.
