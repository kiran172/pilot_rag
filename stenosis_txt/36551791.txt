Title: The Need to Shift from Morphological to Structural Assessment for Carotid Plaque Vulnerability.

Abstract: Degree of luminal stenosis is generally considered to be an important indicator for judging the risk of atherosclerosis burden. However, patients with the same or similar degree of stenosis may have significant differences in plaque morphology and biomechanical factors. This study investigated three patients with carotid atherosclerosis within a similar range of stenosis. Using our developed fluid-structure interaction (FSI) modelling method, this study analyzed and compared the morphological and biomechanical parameters of the three patients. Although their degrees of carotid stenosis were similar, the plaque components showed a significant difference. The distribution range of time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS) of patient 2 was wider than that of patient 1 and patient 3. Patient 2 also had a much smaller plaque stress compared to the other two patients. There were significant differences in TAWSS and plaque stresses among three patients. This study suggests that plaque vulnerability is not determined by a single morphological factor, but rather by the combined structure. It is necessary to transform the morphological assessment into a structural assessment of the risk of plaque rupture.
