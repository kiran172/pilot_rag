Title: Difficulties in Carotid Artery Stenting Due to Calcified Nodules: A Case Report.

Abstract: The feasibility of carotid artery stenting (CAS) for carotid stenosis with severely calcified plaque remains controversial. Understanding the features associated with CAS difficulty in lesions with severe calcification is crucial. Calcified nodules, one of the morphological patterns of calcified plaques, have not been assessed for their association with the feasibility of CAS, even though they are associated with failure of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in coronary arteries. We present a rare case of carotid stenosis with calcified nodules in whom CAS was unsuccessful and who was subsequently successfully treated by carotid endarterectomy (CEA). A 79-year-old man presented with a transient ischemic attack caused by severe stenosis of the right internal carotid artery and opted for CAS. During the procedure, multiple attempts at balloon angioplasty using a 3.5-mm balloon were made, but effective dilation could not be achieved, resulting in recoil. Subsequently, the patient underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA), and the excised specimen revealed a calcified nodule, a large nodular calcified plaque protruding into the lumen. The patient was discharged with a modified Rankin Scale score of 0 at 19 days after the CEA. The protrusion of this large calcified nodule into the lumen was deemed responsible for the inadequate stent dilation. Although rarely reported in carotid stenosis, calcified nodules might represent a challenging plaque type for CAS treatment.
