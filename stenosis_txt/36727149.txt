Title: Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty in Chronic Total Subclavian Venous Stenosis Using Coronary Guidewire: A Case Report.

Abstract: Arteriovenous fistula is the best permanent vascular access for hemodialysis (HD). However, in our country, HD catheter in jugular or subclavian vein is more commonly found because our patients prefer to hold HD until the complications are unbearable. The catheter increases risk of venous stenosis on site and in surrounding vessels, resulting in access loss. Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA), combined with stent deployment, can be utilized as main treatment for such stenosis in subclavian vein. This method dated back to two decades ago with high success rate. Nevertheless, reports or studies of angioplasty in total occlusion are scarce, mainly because of lower success rate and the need of smaller penetrating wire. We describe our experience in performing PTA and stent deployment using coronary wire to penetrate total occlusion in subclavian venous stenosis after vein cannulation. We hope that we can give an alternative technique to avoid surgery in such cases.
