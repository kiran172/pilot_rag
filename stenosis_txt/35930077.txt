Title: Segmented carotid endarterectomy for treatment of Riles type 1A common carotid artery occlusion.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Common carotid artery occlusion (CCAO) is a rare cause of cerebrovascular events. Symptomatic lesions are resistant to medical treatment and revascularization is often required, but there is no consensus on the treatment of CCAO at present. Riles type 1A CCAO is most likely to benefit from revascularization because it has patent outflow tract (internal carotid artery) which was supplied by patent external carotid artery (ECA) from collateral circulation. We described a novel surgical technique improved on the basis of the carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for treatment of Riles type 1A CCAO.
METHODS: We rigorously screened ten patients with symptomatic Riles type1A CCAO for surgery from January 2017 to May 2019 and performed a full preoperative assessment of the inadequate collateral circulation compensation. Moreover, we retrospectively reviewed our experience of the segmented CEA in the treatment of them in our single center.
RESULTS: Segmented CEA was performed on the left side in four cases and on the right side in six cases. The technical success rate of the procedure was 100%. Primary suture was used in nine cases. Only one patient (right CCAO) who had a history of neck radiotherapy was treated by the patch CEA. The mean temporary blocking time during surgery was 52.8 ± 9.15 min. The mean temporary blocking time for treating the upper segment of the common carotid artery (CCA) was 11.1 ± 2.64 min. In the postoperative period, cerebral perfusion on the ipsilateral site improved in all patients, myocardial infarction occurred in one patient, and recurrent laryngeal nerve damage occurred in another. No ischemic events or re-occlusion or restenosis (> 50%) of the treated CCA occurred during the mean follow-up of 32.6 ± 9.3 months. The preoperative mean modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score was 1.9 (range, 1-3; median, 2). At last follow-up for all patients, the mRS score was 1 (range, 0-3; median, 1).
CONCLUSION: Segmented CEA, which utilizes the compensatory effect of collateral circulation, is an effective and safe technique to treat patients suffering from Riles type 1A CCAO with hemodynamic cerebrovascular compromise.
