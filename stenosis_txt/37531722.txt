Title: Apolipoprotein E ε2 allele is associated with lower risk of carotid artery obstruction in a population-based autopsy study.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele has been associated with higher carotid atherosclerosis risk, while the APOE-ε2 seems to decrease this risk. Data from autopsy studies, where carotid arteries can be evaluated in their full extension, is scarce. Therefore, we investigated the association between APOE alleles and direct morphometric measurements of carotid atherosclerosis in an autopsy study with an admixed sample.
METHODS: We measured the intima-media thickness (IMT) and stenosis of the common (CCA) and internal carotid (ICA) arteries. The APOE polymorphisms were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Participants were classified into three groups according to the APOE alleles (ε2, ε3, and ε4). We evaluated the association between APOE groups and carotid atherosclerosis using adjusted regression models and included interaction terms of APOE alleles with age, sex, and race.
RESULTS: We evaluated 1,850 carotid artery samples from 185 participants (mean age=75±12 years old, 55% female, and 71% White). The APOE-ε2 group (n=17) had a lower carotid obstruction and a lower number of severe stenoses (≥ 70%). Having at least one ε4 allele (n=51) was not associated with carotid atherosclerosis. APOE alleles were also not associated with carotid IMT. Age, sex, and race did not modify these relationships.
CONCLUSION: APOE-ε2 carriers had a lower percentage of carotid obstruction and less severe stenosis. APOE-ε4 was not related to a higher risk of carotid atherosclerosis in this cross-sectional population-based autopsy study.
