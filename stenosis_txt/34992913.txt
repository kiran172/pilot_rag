Title: Symptomatic thoracic ossification of the ligamentum flavum in a patient with ankylosing spondylitis: Report of a case and review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Thoracic spinal cord compression due to both ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF) is rare.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 33-year-old male with AS presented with a paraparesis attributed to MR documented T9-T10 OLF/stenosis. He was successfully managed with a decompressive laminectomy; this resulted in marked improvement of his deficit.
CONCLUSION: Thoracic OLF and AS rarely contribute T9-T10 spinal cord compression that may be readily relieved with a decompressive laminectomy.
