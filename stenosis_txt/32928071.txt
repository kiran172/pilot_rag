Title: The diagnostic value of multi-detector CT angiography for catheter-related central venous stenosis in hemodialysis patients.

Abstract: The objective is to compare Multi-detector CT angiography (MDCTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) in diagnosing hemodialysis catheter related-central venous stenosis (CVS). During a period of 6 years, hemodialysis patients with suspected catheter related-CVS who received both MDCTA and DSA were retrospectively enrolled. We analyzed the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, Cohen's kappa coefficient (κ) and other diagnostic parameters for MDCTA compared to DSA. A total of 1533 vascular segments in 219 patients were analyzed. Among the 280 lesions identified by DSA, 156 were correctly identified by MDCTA. There were 124 false negative and 41 false positive diagnoses. MDCTA had a high specificity (96.73%) but a low sensitivity (55.71%), with a moderate inter-test agreement (κ = 0.5930). In stratified analyses of vascular segments, the specificities of MDCTA were 89.93% (superior vena cava), 98.95% (left brachiocephalic vein), 95.33% (right brachiocephalic vein), 99.53% (left subclavian vein), 97.61% (right subclavian vein), 97.13% (left internal jugular vein), and 95.86% (right internal jugular vein), while the sensitivities were 90.00%, 65.52%, 66.67%, 87.50%, 40.00%, 20.00% and 8.11%, respectively. Good to excellent inter-test agreement was observed for the superior vena cava (κ = 0.7870), left brachiocephalic vein (κ = 0.7300), right brachiocephalic vein (κ = 0.6610), and left subclavian vein (κ = 0.8700) compared with poor to low agreement for the right subclavian vein (κ = 0.3950), left internal jugular vein (κ = 0.1890), and right internal jugular vein (κ = 0.0500). MDCTA had a high specificity in diagnosing hemodialysis catheter related-CVS. Its sensitivity varied by central venous segments, with better performance in superior vena cava and brachiocephalic veins.
