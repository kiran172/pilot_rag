Title: Small bowel obstruction after laparoscopic gastrectomy: An atypical clinical presentation. Report of a case.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Postoperative adhesions represent the most common cause of acute small bowel obstruction (80%) and are usually a consequence of abdomino-pelvic surgery performed with open technique.
PRESENTATION OF CASE: A 45-year-old black man arrived at the emergency room with abdominal pain and distension three months after laparoscopic distal gastrectomy with Roux-en-Y anastomosis performed for benign pyloric stenosis. CT abdominal scan revealed some air-fluid levels in the center of the abdomen with distension of proximal jejunal loops caused by intestinal adhesions. Laparoscopic adhesiolysis was performed to restore the intestinal transit.
DISCUSSION: The formation of adhesions is more frequent after abdomino-pelvic surgery. CT abdominal scan is very useful tool to identify the level and the aetiology of obstruction and it may predict the need for surgery, the location of different adhesive bands in order to identify wich patients are likely candidates for laparoscopic treatment.
CONCLUSION: In selected cases, laparoscopic approach for small bowel obstruction is a good surgical option. In patients with adbominal dense adhesions or clinical signs of intestinal ischemia, conversion to laparotomy should be considered an alternative.
