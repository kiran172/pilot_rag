Title: The first report of transcatheter aortic valve-in-valve implantation within the expandable Inspiris Resilia® bioprosthetic valve.

Abstract: A 61-year-old male who underwent aortic valve replacement with an Inspiris Resilia® aortic bioprosthetic through an upper partial sternotomy due to severe aortic valve stenosis was presented 1 year later to our hospital suffering from dyspnoea and chest pain. The transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated moderate haemodynamic structural valve deterioration with a mean gradient of 29 mmHg and a valve area of 0.9 cm2. Due to relatively high-risk of reoperation, valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement with Sapien 3® 29 mm, followed by balloon valvuloplasty, was successfully performed. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published case of valve-in-valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement into a degenerated Inspiris Resilia® aortic valve.
