Title: Predictive value of the frontal QRS-T angle for a permanent pacemaker requirement in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Despite recent advances, the requirement for permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) remains high. The frontal QRS-T angle (fQRS-Ta) indicates ventricular electrical instability as well as ventricular depolarization and repolarization heterogeneity. The predictive value of fQRS-Ta for the PPM requirement after TAVI is lacking. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the predictive value of baseline fQRS-Ta for the requirement of PPM after TAVI.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study conducted at a single tertiary care center. The patients were divided into two groups: those who required a pacemaker (PPM group) and those who did not (No-PPM group). The optimal fQRS-Ta cut-off value for predicting a PPM requirement was determined by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the independent predictors of post-TAVI PPM placement.
RESULTS: Final study population consisted of 184 patients. The mean age of the patients was 79.41 Â± 7.88 years, and 61% (n = 113) were women. Twenty-seven patients who required PPM after TAVI were considered as the 'PPM group'. The baseline frontal QRS and T axes did not differ between the groups, but the fQRS-Ta was significantly higher in the PPM group. ROC analysis performed for the prediction of post-TAVI PPM need, the fQRS-Ta cut-off value was found to be 100.5 with a sensitivity of 74.1% and a specificity of 60.5% [AUC (95% CI): 0.637 (0.520 - 0.755), p: 0.023]. In multivariate analysis, age [HR (95% CI): 1.071 (1.005 - 1.142), p: 0.034] and fQRS-Ta [HR (95% CI): 2.509 (1.084 - 6.399), p: 0.044] were identified as independent risk factors for PPM requirement after TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that age and baseline fQRS-Ta were independent predictors of PPM requirements after TAVI in patients with aortic stenosis.
