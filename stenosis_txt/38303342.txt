Title: [A Case of Neuroendocrine Carcinoma of the Extrahepatic Bile Duct].

Abstract: A 77-year-old man visited a clinic because of nausea and chest discomfort. On blood test, hepatobiliary enzymes were elevated, and he referred to our hospital. Contrast-enhanced CT revealed stenosis of the extrahepatic bile duct and brush cytology of the bile duct showed adenocarcinoma. We therefore performed pancreatoduodenectomy for extrahepatic bile duct cancer. Pathological diagnosis was small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma, pT3N2M0, Stage â…¢A. The patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy and 3 months later contrast-enhanced CT and MRI showed multiple liver metastases. The patient was treated with cisplatin plus irinotecan in the first-line, cisplatin plus etoposide in the second-line, and amrubicin in the third-line and accordingly he died 1 year and 3 months after the surgery. Chemotherapy for neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bile duct is recommended as in small cell lung cancer, but the prognosis is extremely poor. We report this case with a review of some of the literature.
