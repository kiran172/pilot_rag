Title: Diagnosis and Surgical Treatment of Uterine Isthmus Atresia: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Abstract: Uterine isthmus atresia is a rare MÃ¼llerian duct anomaly occasionally diagnosed in adolescents with primary amenorrhea and cyclic abdominal pain. A case is presented of a 14-year-old female with monthly cyclic lower abdominal pain of a 2-year duration. Magnetic resonance imaging and 3-dimensional ultrasound showed separation of a 10-mm fibrotic tissue between the cervical canal and the endometrial cavity. In an attempt to preserve reproductive ability, an end-to-end anastomosis was laparoscopically performed between the cervical canal and uterine cavity. A platinol stent (WallFlex Biliary RX; Boston Scientific, Boston, MA) was placed by hysteroscopy to avoid stenosis after surgery. Laparoscopic end-to-end anastomosis is proposed to treat congenital uterine isthmus atresia.
