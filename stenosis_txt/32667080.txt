Title: Coronary revascularization during treatment of severe aortic stenosis: A meta-analysis of the complete percutaneous approach (PCI plus TAVR) versus the complete surgical approach (CABG plus SAVR).

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The management of patients with coexisting severe aortic stenosis (AS) and coronary artery disease (CAD) is still facing a great deal of uncertainty when it comes to choosing between the entire surgical versus the complete percutaneous approaches, after accurately balancing risks versus outcomes.
AIM: To evaluate clinical outcomes and mortality of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) plus percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared with surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) plus coronary arteries bypass grafting (CABG) procedures in patients with concomitant AS and CAD.
METHODS: Electronic databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and SCOPUS were searched for relevant articles assessing outcome parameters of interest. The study endpoints were the rate of overall myocardial infarction and stroke within 30 days and the rate of 30-day mortality and 2-year mortality between patients with TAVR/PCI and those with SAVR/CABG.
RESULTS: Random-effect meta-analysis did not reveal any significant difference between 30-day safety outcomes: myocardial infarction (TAVR/PCI vs SAVR/CABG: odds ratio [OR]: 0.52; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.20-1.33; I2  = 0%), stroke (TAVR/PCI vs SAVR/CABG: OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.45-1.73; I2  = 0%). No significant difference in 30-day mortality (OR: 0.72; 95% CI: 0.43-1.21; I2  = 0%) and 2-year mortality (OR: 1.50; 95% CI: 0.77-2.94; I2  = 81%) rate was noted between patients with TAVR/PCI and those with SAVR/CABG.
CONCLUSIONS: When comparing the total percutaneous and total surgical treatment, no significant difference in short-term safety outcomes or early and late mortality was observed. More evidence is needed to guide the clinical decision.
