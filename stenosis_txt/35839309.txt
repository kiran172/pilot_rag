Title: Total Obliteration and Subsequent Recanalization of Esophagus via Endoscopic Rendezvous Procedure in a Pediatric Patient.

Abstract: Esophageal strictures are well-known to the pediatric gastroenterology and surgery communities. Such strictures can arise from congenital malformations, inflammatory disorders, gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), or even caustic substance ingestion. Rarely, in the instances of caustic ingestion, GERD, or inflammatory disorders, total obliteration of the esophageal lumen has been described. In those instances, as well as in those with high-grade stenosis refractory to dilations, esophageal reconstruction is the procedure of choice. However, in a small subset of adults with short-segment total esophageal obliteration after radiotherapy, an endoscopic rendezvous procedure has been described. Here we present a case of a 2-year-old female with total esophageal luminal obliteration with successful recanalization using an endoscopic rendezvous procedure. This case presents a unique approach to esophageal recanalization using a minimally invasive technique, only documented in the adult literature.
