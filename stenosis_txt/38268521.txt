Title: von Willebrand factor Ristocetin co-factor activity to von Willebrand factor antigen level ratio for diagnosis of acquired von Willebrand syndrome caused by aortic stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Severe aortic stenosis (AS) causes acquired von Willebrand syndrome by the excessive shear stress-dependent cleavage of high molecular weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF). While the current standard diagnostic method is so-called VWF multimer analysis that is western blotting under nonreducing conditions, it remains unclear whether a ratio of VWF Ristocetin co-factor activity (VWF:RCo) to VWF antigen levels (VWF:Ag) of <0.7, which can be measured with an automated coagulation analyzer in clinical laboratories and is used for the diagnosis of hereditary von Willebrand disease.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluated whether the VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag is useful for the diagnosis of AS-induced acquired von Willebrand syndrome.
METHODS: VWF:RCo and VWF:Ag were evaluated with the VWF large multimer index as a reference, which represents the percentage of a patient's VWF high molecular weight multimer ratio to that of standard plasma in the VWF multimer analysis.
RESULTS: We analyzed 382 patients with AS having transaortic valve maximal pressure gradients of &gt;30 mmHg, 27 patients with peripheral artery disease, and 46 control patients free of cardiovascular disease with osteoarthritis, diabetes, and so on. We assumed a large multimer index of &lt;80% as loss of VWF large multimers since 59.0% of patients with severe AS had the indices of &lt;80%, while no control patients or patients with peripheral artery disease, except for 2 patients, exhibited the indices of &lt;80%. The VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratios, measured using an automated blood coagulation analyzer, were correlated with the indices (r<sub>s</sub> = 0.470, P &lt; .001). When the ratio of &lt;0.7 was used as a cut-off point, the sensitivity and specificity to VWF large multimer indices of &lt;80% were 0.437 and 0.826, respectively.
CONCLUSION: VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratios of <0.7 may indicate loss of VWF large multimers with high specificity, but low sensitivity. VWF:RCo/VWF:Ag ratios in patients with AS having a ratio of <0.7 may be useful for monitoring the loss of VWF large multimers during their clinical courses.
