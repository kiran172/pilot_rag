Title: Segment-specific progression of carotid artery atherosclerosis: a magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the segment-specific progression of atherosclerotic carotid plaques using serial multi-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.
METHODS: Symptomatic patients with carotid 30-70% stenosis were recruited and underwent carotid MR vessel wall imaging at baseline and follow-up time point (≥ 6 months after baseline). The location of plaques was determined according to the maximum wall thickness located above or below carotid bifurcation. The baseline and changing characteristics of carotid plaques were compared between plaques above and below carotid bifurcation, and the risk factors for segment-specific plaque progression were analyzed with logistic regression.
RESULTS: Ninety-six carotid plaques from 73 patients (mean age 66.5 ± 11.4 years old) were eligible for statistical analysis. Compared with plaques located below carotid bifurcation, those above bifurcation had significantly greater stenosis at baseline (57.2 ± 13.0% vs. 50.4 ± 13.5%, p = 0.016, adjusted p = 0.005) and greater progression rate of carotid wall volume (35.2 ± 68.8 mm3/year vs. 4.2 ± 65.0 mm3/year, p = 0.026, adjusted p = 0.005) before and after adjusting for all clinical risk factors and baseline stenosis and wall volume of carotid arteries. Logistic regression showed that the related risk factors were age, hypertension, and smoke for the progression of plaques located above the bifurcation and age for plaques below the bifurcation, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Plaques located above the bifurcation of carotid arteries had greater annual progression and correlated with more cardiovascular risk factors compared with those located below the bifurcation.
