Title: Coronary stenosis is a risk marker for impaired cardiac function on cardiopulmonary exercise test.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac function varies in different ways in ischemic heart disease (IHD). We aimed to evaluate the characteristics of cardiac function on cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) in IHD with different coronary stenoses.
METHODS: Totally 614 patients with IHD were divided into non-obstructive coronary artery disease (NOCAD) (stenosis &lt; 50%), obstructive coronary artery disease (OCAD) (stenosis 50-90%) and severe OCAD ( stenosis &gt; 90%) according to the coronary angiography. And 101 healthy volunteers as controls. All participants performed CPET to assess cardiac function by oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub>), estimated cardiac output (CO), and heart rate (HR).
RESULTS: Generally, the values of VO<sub>2</sub>, CO, and HR in IHD were significantly lower than in healthy volunteers. Among 289 NOCAD, 132 OCAD, and 193 severe OCAD, significantly decreased values of VO<sub>2</sub>, CO, HR were observed (VO<sub>2</sub> peak: 16.01 ± 4.11 vs. 15.66 ± 4.14 vs. 13.33 ± 3.4 mL/min/kg; CO: 6.96 ± 2.34 vs. 6.87 ± 2.37 vs. 6.05 ± 1.79 L/min; HR: 126.44 ± 20.53 vs. 115.15 ± 18.78 vs. 109.07 ± 16.23 bpm, P &lt; 0.05). NOCAD had significantly lower VO<sub>2</sub> at anaerobic threshold (-1.35, 95%CI -2.16 - -0.54) and VO<sub>2</sub> peak (-2.05, 95%CI -3.18 - -0.93) compared with healthy volunteers after adjustment. All IHD patients were associated with low stroke volume and inefficient gas exchange (P &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: IHD with increasing atherosclerotic burdens were associated with impaired cardiac output and chronotropic response on CPET. NOCAD should be given more early prevention and rigorous follow-up.
