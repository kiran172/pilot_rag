Title: Preoperative Ocular Symptoms Predict Acute Glaucoma After Carotid Revascularization: An Analysis of Combined Single-Center Data and a Systematic Review.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Acute glaucoma is a potential complication of carotid revascularization procedures such as endarterectomy or stenting. Although preoperative ocular hypoperfusion may predispose patients to postoperative glaucoma, the details of this complication have not been clarified.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients who underwent carotid revascularization at our institution from January 2019 to December 2022. These patients were divided into glaucoma and nonglaucoma groups. Given the rarity of the event, a systematic literature review was performed to additionally include data from patients who developed acute glaucoma after carotid revascularization. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors for acute glaucoma.
RESULTS: Thirty-five cases, including 2 from our institution, were included in the glaucoma group, and 130 were included in the nonglaucoma group. Most cases (79%) occurred within five days postoperatively. Multivariate analysis revealed that preoperative ocular symptoms were significantly associated with the development of postoperative glaucoma (odds ratio, 361.06; 95% confidence interval, 34.09-3824.27; P < 0.001). Preoperative neovascularization at the iris or anterior chamber angle, indicating severe ocular hypoperfusion, was found in 84% of patients with glaucoma. Permanent visual loss occurred in 41% of patients. The incidence of postoperative glaucoma at our institution was 1.5% (2/132). The positive predictive value of preoperative ocular symptoms for postoperative glaucoma was 0.25 (95% confidence interval, 0.18-0.32).
CONCLUSIONS: This study was the first to clarify the risk factors and characteristics of acute glaucoma after carotid revascularization.
