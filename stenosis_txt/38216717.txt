Title: Investigating hybrid nanoparticles for drug delivery in multi-stenosed catheterized arteries under magnetic field effects.

Abstract: This groundbreaking study pioneers the exploration of the therapeutic implications of a constant magnetic field simultaneously with hybrid nanoparticles on blood flow within a tapered artery, characterized by multiple stenosis along its exterior walls and a central thrombus, employing three-dimensional bio-fluid simulations. In addition, a magnetized catheter is inserted into the thrombus to increase the therapeutic potential of this novel method. The flow condition under consideration has applications in targeted medication distribution, improved medical device design, and improved diagnostics, as well as in advancing healthcare and biomedical engineering. Our investigation primarily aims to optimize blood flow efficiency, encompassing key parameters like pressure, velocity, and heat fluctuations influenced by diverse geometric constraints within the stenotic artery. Precise solutions are obtained through the finite element method (FEM) coupled with advanced bio-fluid dynamics (BFD) software. Hybrid nanoparticles and magnetic fields impacted pressure and velocity, notably reducing pressure within the stenosis. Convective heat flux remained uniform, while temperature profiles showed consistent inlet rise and gradual decline with transient variations. This approach promotes fluid flow, and convection within stenosed arteries, enhances heat transport, evacuates heat from stenotic regions, and improves heat dispersion to surrounding tissues. These findings hold promise for targeted therapies, benefiting patients with vascular disorders, and advancing our understanding of complex bio-fluid dynamics.
