Title: Association of biomarker S100B and cerebral oximetry with neurological changes during carotid endarterectomy performed in awake patients.

Abstract: Background: This study attempted to correlate neurological symptoms in awake patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy (CEA) under local anaesthesia (LA) with serum concentration of S100B protein and measurement of cerebral oximetry with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Patients and methods: A total of 64 consecutive CEAs in 60 patients operated under LA during an 18-month period were prospectively evaluated. A cerebral oximeter was used to measure cerebral oxygen saturation (rSO<sub>2</sub>) before and after cross-clamping along with serum concentration of the S100B protein. Selective shunting was performed when neurological changes occurred, regardless of NIRS. Neurological deterioration occurred (neurological symptoms group) in 7 (10.9 %) operations. In 57 (89.1 %) operations, the patients were neurologically stable (no neurological symptoms group). Results: The neurological symptoms that occurred after clamping correlated with an increase in the serum level of S100B (P = .040). The cut-off of 22.5 % of S100B increase was determined to be optimal for identifying patients with neurological symptoms. There was no correlation between rSO<sub>2</sub> decline and neurological symptoms (P = .675). Two (3.1 %) perioperative strokes occurred. Conclusions: We found a correlation between neurological symptoms and serum S100B protein increase. However, because of the long evaluation time of serum S100B, this monitoring technique cannot be performed during CEA.
