Title: Morphological characteristics associated with ruptured intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Morphological risk factors for the rupture of intracranial vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (IVADAs) have not been well characterized. In this study, we aim to identify morphological characteristics associated with IVADA rupture.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study of 249 consecutive patients with single IVADAs (31 ruptured and 218 unruptured) admitted to Beijing Tiantan Hospital between January 2016 and December 2020. Various morphological parameters were measured using three-dimensional digital subtraction angiography images. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify morphological characteristics associated with IVADA rupture.
RESULTS: Univariate regression analysis revealed that the coexistence of significant proximal and distal stenosis and posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) involvement were associated with IVADA rupture, while the origin from the dominant vertebral artery was inversely associated with the rupture. Multivariate regression analysis demonstrated that the coexistence of significant proximal and distal stenosis (OR 22.00, 95% CI 5.60 to 86.70, p<0.001) and PICA involvement (OR 4.55, 95%â€‰CI 1.36 to 15.20, p=0.014) were independently associated with IVADA rupture.
CONCLUSION: The coexistence of significant proximal and distal stenosis and PICA involvement were independently associated with IVADA rupture. These morphological characteristics may facilitate the assessment of rupture risk in patients with IVADAs.
