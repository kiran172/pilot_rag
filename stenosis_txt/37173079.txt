Title: Case study highlighting cauda equina syndrome and the effects on bladder management.

Abstract: Cauda equina syndrome (CES) is a rare and severe type of spinal stenosis, where all the nerves in the lower back suddenly become severely compressed. It is a serious medical emergency, and compression of the nerves in the lower portion of the spinal canal can lead to permanent loss of bowel and bladder control, paraesthesia, and paralysis of the legs if left untreated. Causes of CES include: trauma, spinal stenosis, herniated discs, spinal tumour, cancerous tumour, inflammatory and infectious conditions or due to an accidental medical intervention. CES patients typically present with symptoms of: saddle anaesthesia, pain, incontinence and numbness. Any of these are red flag symptoms and require immediate investigation and treatment.
