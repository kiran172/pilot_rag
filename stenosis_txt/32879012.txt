Title: Severe Systemic Vascular Disease Prevents Cardiac Catheterization.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary angiography is an invasive procedure that uses iodinated contrast to visualize the coronary arteries. Properly performing the procedure depends on adequate peripheral access. Although access most commonly is achieved through the radial or femoral arteries, which typically are unobstructed conduits to the heart, several access points might be needed.
DISCUSSION: Presented is the case of a failed cardiac catheterization caused by bilateral subclavian and bilateral ileofemoral occlusions in which all access points were exhausted.
CONCLUSION: This case represents a rare clinical scenario infrequently reported in the literature that highlights the important role of multimodality imaging in caring for patients with complex medical issues.
