Title: Bioresorbable Scaffold Use in Coronary Chronic Total Occlusions: A Long-Term, Single-Center Follow-Up Study.

Abstract: Background and Objectives: Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of chronic total occlusion (CTO) is often associated with longer total stent length. Our aim was to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of bioresorbable scaffold (BRS) implantation in CTO to avoid using a full metal jacket. Materials and Methods: We conducted a single-center prospective longitudinal case study including 34 patients who underwent PCI of CTO with at least one BRS and drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation (n = 27) or BRS-only at the Latvian Centre of Cardiology between 2016 and 2018. Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and intravascular ultrasound were performed during the index procedure and long-term follow-up. Results: Of 34 patients with a mean age of 60.6 ± 9.5 years, 76.5% were male. The most common CTO artery was the right coronary artery (73.5%, n = 25). The median length of occlusion was 23.0 mm (interquartile range (IQR) = 13.9-32.7), with a total mean BRS/DES length of 49.6 ± 20.4 mm. During the median follow-up of 5.6 years (IQR = 5.0-5.9), the primary endpoint of target vessel re-occlusion occurred in 5.9% (n = 2) of patients. Target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in 35.3% (n = 12) of patients, with a mean time to TLR of 62.5 (95% confidence interval (CI), 53.9-71.2) months. Through QCA, there was a statistically significant increase in median residual diameter stenosis (20.1-31.4%, p &lt; 0.01) and residual length of stenosis (5.2-7.1%, p = 0.04) compared with the index procedure. Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that BRS is a safe and feasible option for PCI of CTO, allowing for the avoidance of long segment stenting and ensuring long-term patency of the coronary artery.
