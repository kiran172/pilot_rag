Title: Preoperative and postoperative 3D reconstruction for surgical management of a post-cholecystectomy biliary stricture.

Abstract: Cholecystectomy-related iatrogenic biliary injuries cause intricate postoperative complications that can significantly affect a patient's life, often leading to chronic liver disease and biliary stenosis. These patients require a multidisciplinary approach with intervention from radiologists, endoscopists and surgeons experienced in hepatobiliary reconstruction. Symptoms vary from none to jaundice, pruritus and ascending cholangitis. The best strategy for the management of biliary stricture is based on optimal preoperative planning. Our patient presented 1 year after an iatrogenic lesion was induced during a cholecystectomy, and was managed with a complex common bile duct reconstruction through a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy. The three-dimensional (3D) model reconstruction of the biliary tract was pivotal in the planning of the patient's surgery, providing additional preoperative and intraoperative assistance throughout the procedure. The 3D model's description of detailed spatial relations between the bile duct and the vascular structure in the liver hilum enabled a correct surgical dissection and safe execution of the anastomosis.
