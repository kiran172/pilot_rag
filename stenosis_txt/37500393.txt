Title: Safety and feasibility of zero-contrast transcatheter aortic valve implantation using balloon-expandable valves in patients with aortic stenosis and severe renal impairment: A single-center study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Aortic stenosis (AS) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) can coexist. Repeat exposure to contrast media in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has latent mortality risks and increased risk for acute kidney injury. We aimed to assess our "zero-contrast TAVI" protocol for patients with advanced CKD.
METHODS: Consecutive patients with severe AS who underwent TAVI at a single center registry were enrolled. Zero-contrast TAVI group included patients who underwent TAVI without contrast and who had an estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Conventional TAVI group included patients who underwent the regular TAVI procedure. Patients using balloon-expandable valves via transfemoral approach were analyzed. Baseline clinical and procedural characteristics and clinical outcomes were compared between two groups. The primary outcome was early safety as defined by Valve Academic Research Consortium Criteria. Secondary outcomes included the presence of severe prosthesis-patient mismatch, moderate or greater perivalvular leakage, and requirement for new dialysis (within 3 months).
RESULTS: A total of 520 patients were analyzed. Among these, 32 (6 %) underwent zero-contrast TAVI and 488 (94 %) conventional TAVI. In the zero-contrast TAVI group, 12 patients (37.5 %) had to use 20.7 (11.0-31.2) mL of contrast media. There were no significant differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between zero-contrast TAVI and conventional TAVI groups (78.1 % vs. 86.8 %, P = 0.184 and 9.4 % vs. 8.1 %, P = 0.738 for the primary and secondary outcomes, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Zero-contrast TAVI is feasible, safe, and effective in patients with AS and stage 4 CKD.
