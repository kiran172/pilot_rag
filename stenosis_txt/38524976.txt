Title: Severe Symptomatic Aortic Stenosis in an Octogenarian with Congenitally Corrected Transposition of the Great Arteries.

Abstract: • ccTGA accounts for 0.5%-1.4% of patients with congenital heart disease. • Patients with isolated ccTGA can remain undiagnosed for decades. • Very rarely, patients with ccTGA develop symptomatic AS. • Management of severe AS in patients with ccTGA presents unique challenges. • Transcatheter options are limited due to the unique anatomy.
