Title: An Increase in the Ratio of Brain Natriuretic Peptide to Peak Transvalvular Pressure Gradient Suggests Coexistence of Cardiovascular Complications in Elderly Aortic Stenosis Patients.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to differentiate between elderly aortic stenosis (AS) patients with and without cardiovascular complications (CCs).In total, 156 consecutive patients with AS aged ≥ 70 years were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups as follows: AS without CCs (group I; n = 110) and AS with CCs (group II; n = 46). Routine electrocardiographic and echocardiographic parameters, peak and mean transvalvular pressure gradients (TPGs), aortic valve area (AVA), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels, and BNP/peak TPG ratio were measured.The mean ages in groups I and II were 80.4 ± 5.5 and 82.5 ± 7.2 years. Left ventricular hypertrophy was greater in group II than in group I. Left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions and left ventricular fractional shortening were normal in both groups. Peak and mean TPGs were greater in group II (67.2 ± 39.3 and 40.2 ± 26.4 mmHg) than in group I (52.0 ± 23.0 and 30.2 ± 13.9, both P < 0.005); however, the AVA showed no significant difference between the 2 groups. The median BNP levels were 65.9 and 433.7 pg/mL in groups I and II (P < 0.0001). A correlation between peak TPG and BNP levels was observed in both groups. The BNP/peak TPG ratio was < 3.0 in all patients of group I and ≥ 3.0 in almost all patients of group II (P< 0.0001). The area under the curve using BNP/peak TPG ratio was 0.9883.BNP and BNP/peak TPG ratio could differentiate between AS with and without CCs in elderly patients.
