Title: Is there an association between a high monocyte/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio and recurrence of urethral stricture after internal urethrotomy?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Internal urethrotomy (IU) has been the most commonly used procedure for the treatment of urethral strictures (US) since it was described by Scahse in 1974. Although simple to perform and associated with a short recovery time, the main disadvantage is the high recurrence rate of stenosis. At present, there are no markers available for the prediction of recurrence after IU. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between MHR and recurrence rates.
METHODS: The data of a total of 250 male patients who underwent IU for the first time for bulbar urethral stricture less than 2cm in our hospital between January 2011 and January 2019 were retrospectively analysed. The MHR was calculated as the ratio of monocytes to HDL-C.
RESULTS: In all, 78 patients experienced a recurrence while the remaining 177 did not. The stricture recurrence rate was recorded as 31.2% at the 3-year follow-up. There was a statistically significant difference in stricture length and MHR (P=0.015 and 0.001 respectively). MHR was high in the recurrent group. As a result of the Chi-square test, the positive predictive values (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were 65.3% and 89.7%, respectively. ROC analysis was used to determine the optimal cut-off value. The cut-off value was found to be 1.72.
CONCLUSION: In our opinion, a high MHR may indicate the presence of immune inflammation and it can be used as a prognostic factor for stricture recurrence after IU.
