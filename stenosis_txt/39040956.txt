Title: Extensive Cytomegalovirus Gastroduodenitis Causing Gastric Outlet Obstruction in an Immunocompetent Patient.

Abstract: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been extensively researched in immunocompromised people, causing conditions such as colitis, retinitis, esophagitis, encephalitis, and pneumonitis. However, there are limited data on how the disease presents itself in immunocompetent hosts, apart from a self-limited mononucleosis-like syndrome. This case report presents CMV gastroenteritis causing gastroduodenal obstruction in an immunocompetent woman. It is important to consider CMV as a potential cause of various gastric pathologies in immunocompetent people. Further research is necessary to establish guidelines for diagnosing and treating this pathogen.
