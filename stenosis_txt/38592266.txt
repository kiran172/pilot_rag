Title: Timing of acute carotid artery stenting for tandem lesions in patients with acute ischemic stroke: A Maastricht Stroke Quality Registry (MaSQ-Registry) study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To better understand the influence of treatment strategies on outcomes for patients with tandem lesions undergoing acute internal carotid artery (ICA) stenting during endovascular treatment (EVT), this study compared clinical, technical, and safety outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a large vessel occlusion (LVO) who underwent ICA stenting before versus after intracranial thrombectomy.
METHODS: This single-center retrospective cohort study included patients who underwent EVT due to a LVO and periprocedural ICA stenting for significant ICA stenosis or occlusion between September 2020 and January 2023. Data were extracted from the Maastricht Stroke Quality Registry (MaSQ-Registry). Primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included procedure times, number of total thrombectomy attempts, first-attempt excellent recanalization rates (extended Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) ≥ 2C after one thrombectomy attempt), and safety outcomes.
RESULTS: This study included 50 patients. Thirty-one patients (62%) underwent ICA stenting before intracranial thrombectomy. No significant differences between both groups were found regarding mRS, total procedure time, number of total thrombectomy attempts, first-attempt excellent recanalization, or complications. Time between groin puncture and recanalization (reperfusion time) was significantly longer in patients who had ICA stenting before intracranial thrombectomy versus after intracranial thrombectomy (45 min versus 28 min, P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: ICA stenting after intracranial thrombectomy in patients with tandem lesions undergoing EVT did not lead to better patient outcomes compared to stenting before intracranial thrombectomy, despite shorter reperfusion times.
