Title: Diagnostic performance of deep learning algorithm for analysis of computed tomography myocardial perfusion.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a deep learning (DL) algorithm predicting hemodynamically significant coronary artery disease (CAD) by using a rest dataset of myocardial computed tomography perfusion (CTP) as compared to invasive evaluation.
METHODS: One hundred and twelve consecutive symptomatic patients scheduled for clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography (ICA) underwent CCTA plus static stress CTP and ICA with invasive fractional flow reserve (FFR) for stenoses ranging between 30 and 80%. Subsequently, a DL algorithm for the prediction of significant CAD by using the rest dataset (CTP-DL<sub>rest</sub>) and stress dataset (CTP-DL<sub>stress</sub>) was developed. The diagnostic accuracy for identification of significant CAD using CCTA, CCTA + CTP stress, CCTA + CTP-DL<sub>rest</sub>, and CCTA + CTP-DL<sub>stress</sub> was measured and compared. The time of analysis for CTP stress, CTP-DL<sub>rest</sub>, and CTP-DL<sub>Stress</sub> was recorded.
RESULTS: Patient-specific sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) of CCTA alone and CCTA + CTP<sub>Stress</sub> were 100%, 33%, 100%, 54%, 63%, 67% and 86%, 89%, 89%, 86%, 88%, 87%, respectively. Patient-specific sensitivity, specificity, NPV, PPV, accuracy, and AUC of CCTA + DL<sub>rest</sub> and CCTA + DL<sub>stress</sub> were 100%, 72%, 100%, 74%, 84%, 96% and 93%, 83%, 94%, 81%, 88%, 98%, respectively. All CCTA + CTP stress, CCTA + CTP-DL<sub>Rest</sub>, and CCTA + CTP-DL<sub>Stress</sub> significantly improved detection of hemodynamically significant CAD compared to CCTA alone (p &lt; 0.01). Time of CTP-DL was significantly lower as compared to human analysis (39.2 ± 3.2 vs. 379.6 ± 68.0 s, p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Evaluation of myocardial ischemia using a DL approach on rest CTP datasets is feasible and accurate. This approach may be a useful gatekeeper prior to CTP stress<sub>.</sub>.
