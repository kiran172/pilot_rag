Title: [Laryngotracheal resection with tracheoesophageal fistula closure in a patient with post-tracheostomy total cicatricial atresia of the larynx and tracheal stenosis combined with cricoid cartilage fracture].

Abstract: Treatment of patients with post-intubation (post-tracheostomy) stenotic laryngotracheal lesions combined with tracheoesophageal fistula is the most difficult problem for various specialists. A 20-year-old patient received a severe concomitant injury with necessary prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. Decannulation was followed by shortness of breath and cough with discharge of sputum mixed with liquid and food. Post-tracheostomy total cicatricial atresia of the larynx and cervical trachea combined with cricoid cartilage fracture, as well as tracheoesophageal fistula of cervical trachea was diagnosed. Tracheostomy and gastrostomy were performed. After 3-month rehabilitation, the patient admitted to the Vishnevsky National Medical Research Center of Surgery. After additional examination, the patient underwent circular laryngotracheal resection, closure of tracheoesophageal fistula, laryngotracheal reconstruction (laryngotracheal anastomosis by Grillo with thyroid cartilage repair), re-tracheostomy. A favorable outcome was obtained. In such patients, treatment strategy cannot be standardized and require a personalized approach.
