Title: Drug-Coated Balloon Treatment for Possible Sequelae of Kawasaki Disease Evaluated by Multi-Modalities.

Abstract: The most devastating sequela of Kawasaki disease (KD) is coronary artery complications that may lead to myocardial infarction and cardiac mortality. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and bypass grafting are recommended for KD patients with inducible myocardial ischemia and amendable coronary anatomy. However, there are few reports about coronary revascularization with drug-eluting balloons among KD patients, especially at an early age. We present a case report of multi-modality guidance of PCI with a drug-coated balloon (DCB) for a young patient with acute coronary syndrome and a history of KD. Post-procedural optical coherence tomography, angiography-derived fractional flow reserve, and 12-month coronary artery magnetic resonance showed favorable outcomes. The present case indicated that DCB therapy with intravascular imaging and physiologic assessment guidance may be an alternative strategy to treat severe coronary artery stenosis in selected patients with KD.
