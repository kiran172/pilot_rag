Title: Infant Hydrocephalus.

Abstract: Hydrocephalus is a neurosurgical condition that is highly prevalent in pediatric medicine. In the infant population, there is a distinct set of features that all primary pediatricians would benefit from understanding. Infant hydrocephalus can present prenatally on imaging and postnatally with symptomatic enlargement of the head and associated skull features and raised intracranial pressures. The 2 major pathophysiology models of infant hydrocephalus are the bulk flow and the intracranial pulsatility models. The most common acquired forms of hydrocephalus include posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus, postinfectious hydrocephalus, and brain tumor. The most common congenital forms of hydrocephalus include those due to myelomeningocele, aqueductal stenosis, and posterior fossa malformations. There are various evaluation and treatment algorithms for these different types of hydrocephalus, including cerebrospinal fluid shunting and endoscopic third ventriculostomy. The aim of this review was to elaborate on those features of hydrocephalus to best equip primary pediatricians to diagnose and manage hydrocephalus in infants.
