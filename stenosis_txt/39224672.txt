Title: Transplant renal vein thrombosis and stenosis were rescued by interventional radiology.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transplant renal vein thrombosis is a serious post-transplant complication. We report a case in which a thrombus was found in the transplant renal vein and rescued the transplanted kidney utilizing interventional radiology.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 56-year-old woman underwent ABO-compatible living donor renal transplantation due to impaired renal function caused by IgA nephropathy. On postoperative Day 13, there was a finding on transplant renal echocardiography that appeared to be an interruption of peripheral renal blood flow in diastole. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed that the vein was occluded due to the hematoma, and thrombosis was observed within, and distal contrast showed regurgitation into the collateral vessels. The stenosis was breached and balloon dilation restored progressive blood flow through interventional radiology.
CONCLUSION: Although open surgical thrombectomy is mainly considered for treatment for transplant renal vein thrombosis, interventional radiology might be the alternative treatment option.
