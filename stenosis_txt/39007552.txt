Title: Next-generation transcarotid artery revascularization: TransCarotid flOw Reversal Cerebral Protection And CGUARD MicroNET-Covered Embolic Prevention Stent System To Reduce Strokes - TOPGUARD Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Stent-assisted carotid artery revascularization employing surgical cutdown for transcervical access and dynamic flow reversal (TCAR) is gaining popularity. TCAR, despite maximized intra-procedural cerebral protection, shows a marked excess of 30-day neurologic complications in symptomatic vs. asymptomatic stenoses. The TCAR conventional single-layer stent (free-cell area 5.89mm2) inability to seal embologenic lesions may be particularly relevant after the flow reversal neuroprotection is terminated.
METHODS: We evaluated peri-procedural and 30-day major adverse cerebral and cardiac events (MACCE) of TCAR (ENROUTE, SilkRoad Medical) paired with MicroNET-covered neuroprotective stent (CGuard, InspireMD) in consecutive patients at elevated risk of complications with transfemoral/transradial filter-protected stenting (increased lesion-related and/or access-related risk). CGuard (MicroNET free cell area â‰ˆ0.02-0.03 mm2) has level-1 evidence for reducing intra- and abolishing post-procedural lesion-related cerebral embolism.
RESULTS: One hundred and six increased-risk patients (age 72 [61-76] years, median [Q1-Q3]; 60.4% symptomatic, 49.1% diabetic, 36.8% women, 61.3% left-sided index lesion) were enrolled in three vascular surgery centers. Angiographic stenosis severity was 81 (75-91)%, lesion length 21 (15-26)mm, increased-risk lesional characteristics 87.7%. Study stent use was 100% (no other stent types). 74.5% lesions were predilated; post-dilatation rate was 90.6%. Flow reversal duration was 8 (5-11)min. One stroke (0.9%) occurred in an asymptomatic patient prior to establishing neuroprotection (index lesion disruption with the sheath insertion wire); there were no other peri-procedural MACCE. No further adverse events occurred by 30-days. 30-day stent patency was 100% with normal velocities and absence of any in-stent material by Duplex Doppler.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite a high proportion of increased-risk lesions and clinically symptomatic patients in this study, TCAR employing the MicroNET-covered anti-embolic stent showed 30-day MACCE rate <1%. This suggests a clinical role for combining maximized intra-procedural prevention of cerebral embolism by dynamic flow reversal with anti-embolic stent prevention of peri- and post-procedural cerebral embolism (TOPGUARD NCT04547387).
