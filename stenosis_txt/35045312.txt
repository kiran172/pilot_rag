Title: Partial Claviculectomy to Relieve Tracheal Compression in an Adult Male with Osteomesopyknosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The clavicle is a long bone that forms the anterior border of the thoracic inlet. Anatomic abnormalities of the clavicle can lead to compression of the innominate artery and trachea due to mass effect. These anatomic abnormalities can be amenable to surgical resection, which can provide complete resolution of symptoms.
METHODS: We present a case of tracheal compression by the innominate artery in an adult man, caused by a clavicular abnormality due to an underlying bone mineralization disorder, corrected by partial resection of the right clavicle.
RESULTS: The patient underwent successful open surgical resection of his right clavicular head leading to resolution of his tracheal compression by the innominate artery.
CONCLUSIONS: We believe that this is the first description of tracheal compression due to osteomesopyknosis. This case demonstrates that compression of the innominate artery due to a clavicular abnormality can be safely corrected via open surgical resection.
