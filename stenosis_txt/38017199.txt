Title: Intracardiac Three-Dimensional Image as Surgical Decision-Making Tool of Congenital Heart Disease.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the anatomical reproducibility of a preoperative intracardiac 3D image (IC image) created using computed tomography, and to investigate its usefulness as a surgical decision-making tool. Between 2012 and 2022, ventricular septal defect (VSD) patients, and double outlet right ventricle (DORV) or transposition of the great arteries (TGA) with pulmonary stenosis (PS) patients who underwent cardiac surgery and had preoperative computed tomography were enrolled. SYNAPSE VINCENT® (Fujifilm) was used to create an IC image which was analyzed retrospectively. In 14 VSD patients, the diagnostic consistency rate in the Soto classification with intraoperative findings was 100% (14/14) for IC image versus 64% (9/14) for transthoracic echocardiography (P = 0.04). The defect size showed a higher correlation coefficient with IC image (0.837, P = 0.001) than with transthoracic echocardiography (0.567, P = 0.034). In 11 DORV/TGA with PS patients, the diagnostic consistency rate in the Lev classification was 100% (9/9) for IC image versus 77% (7/9) for transthoracic echocardiography (P = 0.47). The secondary interventricular foramen (SVF)/left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) ratio by IC image was significantly smaller in the biventricular-repair group (median 0.71, IQR 0.67-1.06) than in the univentricular-repair group (median 1.79, IQR 1.53-2.42) (P = 0.006). An IC image is useful as a surgical decision-making tool for simple VSDs and complex congenital heart diseases such as DORV or TGA with pulmonary stenosis. The SVF/LVOT ratio determined from the IC image may be a useful indicator for avoiding LVOT obstruction.
