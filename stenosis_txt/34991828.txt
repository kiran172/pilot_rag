Title: 30-Day and 1-Year Outcomes With HYDRA Self-Expanding Transcatheter Aortic Valve: The Hydra CE Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study sought to evaluate the 30-day and 1-year safety and performance of the Hydra transcatheter aortic valve (THV) (in the treatment of symptomatic severe aortic stenosis in patients at high or extreme surgical risk.
BACKGROUND: The Hydra THV is a novel repositionable self-expanding system with supra-annular bovine pericardial leaflets.
METHODS: The Hydra CE study was a premarket, prospective, multicenter, single-arm study conducted across 18 study centers in Europe and Asia-Pacific countries. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 30 days. All endpoints were adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee.
RESULTS: A total of 157 patients (79.2 ± 7.1 years of age, 58.6% female; Society of Thoracic Surgeons score 4.7 ± 3.4%) were enrolled. Successful implantation was achieved in 94.3% cases. At 30 days, there were 11 (7.0%) deaths, including 9 (5.7%) cardiovascular deaths, of which 5 (3.2%) were device related. At 1 year, there were 23 (14.6%) deaths, including 13 (8.3%) cardiovascular deaths. At 30 days, there were significant improvement of effective orifice area (from 0.7 ± 0.2 cm2 to 1.9 ± 0.6 cm2) and mean aortic valve gradient (from 49.5 ± 18.5 mm Hg to 8.1 ± 3.7 mm Hg), which were sustained up to 1 year. Moderate or severe paravalvular leak was observed in 6.3% of patients at 30 days and 6.9% of patients at 1 year. The rate of new permanent pacemaker implantation was 11.7% at 30 days and 12.4% at 1 year.
CONCLUSIONS: The Hydra CE study demonstrated that transcatheter aortic valve replacement with Hydra THV offered favorable efficacy at 1 year, providing large effective orifice area and low transvalvular gradient as well as acceptable complication rates with regard to new permanent pacemaker and paravalvular leak.
