Title: Five-meter walk test before transcatheter aortic valve replacement and 1-year noncardiac mortality.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to assess whether the 5-m walk test is associated with 1-year mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement.
METHODS: Included in the analysis were 304 patients who received the 5-m walk test and underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement from September 2012 to March 2019. They were classified into 3 groups based on their test score: ≤7, >7, and unable to walk. Preprocedure characteristics, postprocedure outcomes, and follow-up outcomes were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: For the 5-m walk test, 145 had a score ≤7 (Group N), 111 had a score &gt;7 (Group S), and 48 were unable to walk (Group I). Average age in years was 80.2 ± 8.7 years in Group N, 81.2 ± 9.4 years in Group S, and 79.4 ± 9.2 in Group I (P = .23). The aortic valve mean gradient at discharge was 9.5 ± 4.1 mm Hg in Group N, 10.4 ± 5.5 mm Hg in Group S, and 8.2 ± 4.2 mm Hg in Group I (P = .05). The discharge survival was 97.2% in Group N, 96.4% in Group S, and 95.8% in Group I (P = .76). One-year survival was 92.8% in Group N, 84.1% in Group S, and 75% in Group I (P &lt; .01) after adjusting for preprocedure characteristics. Noncardiac death was 5.1% in Group N, 13.1% in Group S, and 22.7% in Group I (P = .03). This indicates that the 5-m walk test was a risk factor for 1-year mortality. More specifically, a poor 5-m walk test score was associated with 1-year noncardiac mortality.
CONCLUSIONS: The 5-m walk test score before transcatheter aortic valve replacement was associated with 1-year mortality, especially noncardiac mortality. It may help identify patients at high risk for 1-year mortality.
