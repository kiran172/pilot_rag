Title: Modern endovascular management of chronic total carotid artery occlusion: technical results and procedural challenges.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The optimal management of chronic total carotid artery occlusion (CTO) is still debated. Endovascular treatment is being increasingly used with heterogeneous technical and clinical results.
METHODS: Patients with CTO treated with modern endovascular approaches during the past several years (January 2018-December 2021) were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: Twenty patients, with a mean age of 63.7 years, were treated during the study period. Indications for treatment were recurrent stroke in 12 (60%), hemodynamic impairment in 4 (20%), and progressive stroke in 4 (20%) patients. In 6 (30%) patients, the occlusion was limited to the cervical portion, in 5 (25%) to the petrous segment, and in 9 (45%) to the cavernous segment. Technical treatment success was achieved in 80% of cases. In patients with successful recanalization, median pretreatment hypoperfusion volumes dropped from 126 mL (25-75 IQR, 33-224 mL) to 0 mL (25-75 IQR, 0-31.5 mL). Symptomatic procedure-related complications were 30% and permanent procedure-related morbidity-mortality was 5%. Early stent occlusion occurred in 5 (25%) cases. Two cases were asymptomatic and were not retreated, 3 cases presented transient symptoms of which two were successfully recanalized. Stent occlusion was not associated with permanent symptoms. In successfully recanalized patients no intraprocedural emboli were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: In the modern endovascular era, revascularization of CTO is a feasible procedure in most cases, and it may be offered in selected patients. However, the high re-occlusion rate is still a limitation of the technique, underlining the need for more research on the technical procedural and periprocedural management.
