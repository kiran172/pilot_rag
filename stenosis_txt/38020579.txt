Title: Primary Tracheobronchial Amyloidosis Presenting with an Upper Airway Obstruction.

Abstract: This is a case of localized primary tracheobronchial amyloidosis in a patient who presented with upper airway obstruction. Tracheobronchial amyloidosis is a type of localized bronchopulmonary amyloidosis that is frequently overlooked. It involves the deposition of amyloid protein on the tracheal and bronchial tissue, leading to progressive tracheal stenosis and airway obstruction that can be seen on imaging as a tracheal mass. Because of its significant diagnostic difficulty and therapeutic conundrum, it ought to be considered in the differential diagnosis of upper airway symptoms with an unknown etiology.
