Title: Bronchus compression relieved by patent ductus arteriosus stenting.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting is evolving as an alternative to surgical aorto-pulmonary shunts for infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow. Given anatomical proximity, the PDA can compress the ipsilateral bronchus. We report a case series of four patients with bronchial compression by a tortuous PDA who underwent PDA stenting.
METHODS: Our four patients received PDA stents for ductal-dependent pulmonary blood flow despite preprocedure imaging evidence of bronchial compression. We reviewed the cross-sectional chest imaging to assess the degree of bronchial compression and the variables that affect it, namely PDA size, PDA tortuosity, and the anatomical relationship between the compressed bronchus and the PDA.
RESULTS: Three out of the four patients had postprocedure imaging, and all showed relief of the previously seen bronchial compression. Post-PDA stenting patients had a smaller and straight PDA with significant lateralization away from the compressed bronchus. None of the four patients developed symptoms of bronchial compression poststenting.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that pre-existing bronchial compression does not preclude PDA stenting. Stent placement in an engorged and tortuous PDA led to significant improvement in pre-existing bronchial compression. Improvement may be attributed to PDA shrinkage, straightening, and lateralization. Further studies are needed to confirm our findings.
