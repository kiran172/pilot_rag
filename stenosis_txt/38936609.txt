Title: A Long-Term Outcome of Symptomatic Middle Cerebral Artery Undergoing Intracranial Angioplasty or Stenting.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: For symptomatic stenosis in the middle cerebral artery (MCA), intracranial angioplasty and stenting are frequently employed. However, limited data exist regarding their long-term impact. Our study demonstrates the long-term advantages in preventing ischemic events through a 5-year follow-up period.
METHODS: A set of 41 individuals with symptomatic stenosis in the MCA who underwent angioplasty or stenting procedures between October 2004 and April 2018 at various hospitals in Southwest China were prospectively enrolled in the study. The rates of successful revascularization, complications, imaging observations, and clinical outcomes were systematically assessed.
RESULTS: A total of 41 individuals successfully underwent stenting, respectively. After stenting, the extent of stenosis was decreased from 71.8% (56-87.8%) to 24.9% (0-45%). The mean follow-up period is 36.9 ± 13.68 months (range, 11-67 months). There was no deterioration of neurological function or a new ischemic event. A DSA or CT angiography was conducted after the procedure and demonstrated no in-stent restenosis. No patient experienced restenosis below 50% during the mean follow-up period. The morbidity and mortality rates of the case series were 7.3% and 2.4%, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In the treatment of symptomatic MCA atherosclerotic stenoses, intracranial angioplasty and stenting are demonstrated to be technically feasible and safe. Its early and long-term efficacy on ischemic event prevention is acceptable, with a reduced level of restenosis, although the representative sample is tiny.
