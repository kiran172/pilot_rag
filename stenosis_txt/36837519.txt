Title: Relationship between Inflammation and Vasospastic Angina.

Abstract: Coronary artery spasm (CAS) is a dynamic coronary stenosis causing vasospastic angina (VSA). However, VSA is a potentially lethal medical condition with multiple presentations, including sudden cardiac death. Despite investigations to explore its pathogenesis, no single mechanism has been found to explain the entire process of VSA occurrence. The roles of elevated local and systemic inflammation have been increasingly recognized in VSA. Treatment strategies to decrease local and systemic inflammation deserve further investigation.
