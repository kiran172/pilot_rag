Title: Correlation between Ultra-Wide-Field Retinal Imaging Findings and Vascular Supra-Aortic Changes in Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: (1) Background: Takayasu arteritis (TA) is a chronic inflammatory large-vessel vasculitis. Ultra-wide-field imaging allows describing the retinal lesions in these patients and correlating them with vascular supra-aortic stenosis. (2) Methods: In total, 54 eyes of 27 patients diagnosed with TA were included, and a complete ophthalmological examination was performed, including UWF color fundus photography (UWF-CFP), fluorescein angiography (UWF-FA), and computed tomography angiography measuring supra-aortic stenosis. Eleven patients underwent Doppler ultrasound imaging assessing the blood flow velocity (BFV) in the central retinal artery (CRA). (3) Results: Microaneurysms were detected in 18.5% of eyes on fundus examination, in 24.4% of eyes on UWF-CFP, and in 94.4% of eyes on UWF-FA. The number of microaneurysms significantly correlated with the presence of an ipsilateral supra-aortic stenosis (p = 0.026), the presence of hypertension (p = 0.0011), and the duration of the disease (p = 0.007). The number of microaneurysms per eye negatively correlated with the BFV in the CRA (r = -0.61; p = 0.003). (4) Conclusions: UWF-FA improved the assessment of TA-associated retinal findings. The significant correlation between the number of microaneurysms and the BFV in the CRA gives new insight to our understanding of Takayasu retinopathy. The total number of microaneurysms could be used as an interesting prognostic factor for TA.
