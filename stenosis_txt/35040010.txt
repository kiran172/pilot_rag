Title: Subclinical right ventricular dysfunction in patients with mitral stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is a strong predictor of poor outcomes of patients with mitral stenosis (MS). The aim of this study was to detect a subclinical right ventricular dysfunction in patients with MS.
METHODS: We conducted a prospective study from January 2015 to June 2019 in 104 asymptomatic patients with MS (mean age: 46.1 ± 4.27 years), and compared to a group of 52 age and sex matched healthy subjects. Standard and speckle tracking echocardiography were performed; parameters of RV function were measured and compared.
RESULTS: Although they were in normal range, RV fractional area change (RVFAC), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), tissue Doppler and pulsed wave Doppler RV myocardial performance index (MPI) and peak systolic velocity (S') were decreased in patients with MS (p < 0.05). The global RV longitudinal strain (LSGRV) and the longitudinal strain of the free wall of the right ventricular (LSFRV) were lower in patients with MS (p, respectively, at 0.001 and < 0.001), 53.5% (n = 47) of patients had LSFRV < - 20%. A significant difference was noted between LSFRV and 2D strain of the septal wall (p = 0.002). No difference was found between patients with severe MS and moderate MS regarding LSFRV and LSGRV. No correlation between LSFRV and FAC (p = 0.85), MPI (p = 0.62), TAPSE (p = 0.31) and S' (p = 0.78) was found.
CONCLUSION: Our study showed the presence of subclinical systolic dysfunction of the right ventricle in patients with MS.
