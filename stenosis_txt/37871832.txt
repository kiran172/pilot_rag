Title: Effect of F11 Receptor/Junctional Adhesion Molecule-A-derived Peptide on Neointimal Hyperplasia in a Murine Model.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To determine whether inhibition of the F11 receptor/JAM-A (F11R) using F11R-specific antagonist peptide 4D results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and migration in vivo, known as neointimal hyperplasia (NIH), using a mouse focal carotid artery stenosis model (FCASM).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The mouse FCASM was chosen to test the hypothesis because the dominant cell type at the site of stenosis is SMC, similar to that in vascular access stenosis. Fourteen C57BL/6 mice underwent left carotid artery (LCA) partial ligation to induce stenosis, followed by daily injection of peptide 4D in 7 mice and saline in the remaining 7 mice, and these mice were observed for 21 days and then euthanized. Bilateral carotid arteries were excised for histologic analysis of the intima and media areas.
RESULTS: The mean intimal area was significantly larger in control mice compared with peptide 4D-treated mice (0.031 mm2 [SD ± 0.024] vs 0.0082 mm2 [SD ± 0.0103]; P = .011). The mean intima-to-intima + media area ratio was significantly larger in control mice compared with peptide 4D-treated mice (0.27 [SD ± 0.13] vs 0.089 [SD ± 0.081]; P = .0079). NIH was not observed in the right carotid arteries in both groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Peptide 4D, an F11R antagonist, significantly inhibited NIH in C57BL/6 mice in a FCASM.
