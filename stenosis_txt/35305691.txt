Title: Diagnostic efficacy of CCTA and CT-FFR based on risk factors for myocardial ischemia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) can observe the degree of coronary artery stenosis and fractional flow reserve (FFR) can diagnose hemodynamic abnormalities caused by coronary artery stenosis. However, noninvasive imaging examination that can both observe the above two methods at the same time has not yet been elucidated.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic efficacy of CCTA and computed tomography-derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) based on different risk factors for myocardial ischemia.
METHODS: Patients undergoing CCTA in our hospital from August 18, 2020 to April 28, 2021 were randomly selected, and the data were subjected to CT-FFR analysis. Vascular characteristics were measured, including total plaque volume, calcified plaque volume, non-calcified plaque volume, plaque length, and lumen stenosis, and the patients were categorized into a non-ischemia group (FFR > 0.8) and an ischemia group (FFR ≤ 0.8). Plaque characteristics were compared between the two groups, and logistic regression analysis was employed to explore the correlations between plaque characteristics and ischemic lesions.
RESULTS: From a total of 122 patients enrolled in the study, there were 218 vascular branches with FFR &gt; 0.8 and 174 vascular branches with FFR ≤ 0.8. There were significant group differences in total plaque volume, calcified plaque volume, plaque length, and lumen stenosis &gt; 50% (n). The obtained data were as follows: non-ischemic group 10.57 (4.80, 259.65), ischemic group 14.87 (3.39, 424.45), Z = 9.772, p = 0.002, non-ischemic group 10.57 (0, 168.77), ischemic group 14.87 (0, 191.00), Z = 2.503, p ≤ 0.001), non-ischemic group 8.17 (37.05, 40.53), ischemic group 8.38 (56.66, 86.47), Z = 5.923, p = 0.016, and lumen stenosis &gt; 50%, non-ischemic group 46, ischemic group 90, x2 = 14.77, p ≤ 0.001. The regression analysis results indicated that total plaque volume, calcified plaque volume, plaque length and lumen stenosis &gt; 50% were risk factors for myocardial ischemia, with ORs and p values of (2.311, p = 0.002), (1.021, p = 0.004), (2.159, p &lt; 0.001), and (0.181, p &lt; 0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSION: Total plaque volume, calcified plaque volume, plaque length and lumen stenosis > 50% are predictors for myocardial ischemia. Coronary artery CCTA combined with CT-FFR could simultaneously observe the anatomical stenosis and evaluate myocardial blood supply at the functional level. Thus, myocardial ischemia could be better diagnosed.
