Title: Chest pain in the emergency department: From score to core-A prospective clinical study.

Abstract: High-sensitivity troponin assay brought new challenges as we detect elevated concentration in many other diseases, and it became difficult to distinguish the real cause of this elevation. In this notion, diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) remains a challenge in emergency department (ED). We aim to examine different approaches for rule-in and rule-out of ACS using risk scores, copeptin, and coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA). A prospective observational study was designed to evaluate chest pain patients. Consecutive adult patients admitted to the ED with a chief complaint of chest pain due to any cause were included. All patients were followed-up for 6 months after discharge for major adverse cardiovascular events and readmissions. Admission data, ED processes, and diagnoses were analyzed. One hundred forty-six patients were included, average age was 63 ± 13.4 years, and 95 (65.1%) were male. Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) and History, ECG, Age, Risk factors, Troponin (HEART) scores showed good prognostic abilities, but HEART combination with copeptin improves diagnoses of myocardial infarction (area under the curve [AUC] 0.764 vs AUC 0.864 P = .0008). Patients with elevated copeptin were older, had higher risk scores, and were more likely to be admitted to hospital and diagnosed with ACS in ED. For copeptin, AUC was 0.715 (95% confidence interval 0.629-0.803), and for combination with troponin, AUC of 0.770 (0.703-0.855) did not improve rule-in of myocardial infarction. High-sensitivity troponin I assay alongside prior stroke, history of carotid stenosis, dyslipidemia, use of diuretics, and electrocardiogram changes (left bundle branch block or ST depression) are good predictors of myocardial infarction (χ² = 52.29, AUC = 0.875 [0.813-0.937], P < .001). The regression analysis showed that combination of copeptin and CCTA without significant stenosis can be used for ACS rule-out (χ² = 26.36, P < .001, AUC = 0.772 [0.681-0.863], negative predictive value of 96.25%). For rule-in of ACS, practitioner should consider not only scores for risk stratification but carefully analyze medical history and nonspecific electrocardiogram changes and even with normal troponin results, we strongly suggest thorough evaluation in chest pain unit. For rule-out of ACS combination of copeptin and CCTA holds great potential.
