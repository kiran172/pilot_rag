Title: Risk factors for digestive morbidities after esophageal atresia repair.

Abstract: Esophageal atresia with/without tracheoesophageal fistula (EA/TEF) is a congenital digestive tract anomaly that represents a major therapeutic challenge. Postoperative digestive morbidities such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal stricture are common. The aim of this study was to identify the incidence of and potential risk factors for digestive morbidities after EA/TEF repair. We retrospectively reviewed all EA/TEF patients who underwent repair at a single institution between January 1999 and December 2018, excluding patients who died prior to discharge. Patient demographics, perioperative management, and postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture rates were collected. We performed univariate and multivariate analyses to examine risk factors associated with postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture. The study enrolled 58 infants (58.6% male, 17.2% with type A EA/TEF, 62.1% with associated anomalies). Postoperative GERD occurred in 67.2% of patients and was the most common digestive morbidity. Esophageal stricture occurred in 37.9% of patients after EA/TEF repair. Multivariate analysis showed that long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD were independent risk factors for esophageal stricture after repair surgery.Conclusion: The incidence of postoperative GERD and esophageal stricture was 67.2% and 37.9%, respectively. The risk factors for postoperative esophageal stricture were long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD. What is Known: • EA/TEF is a congenital digestive tract anomaly with a high postoperative survival rate but can be complicated by many long-term morbidities. What is New: • Long-gap EA/TEF and postoperative GERD are risk factors of anastomotic stricture after repair. • Surgeons and pediatricians should be highly experienced in managing anastomotic tension and the GERD.
