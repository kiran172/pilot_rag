Title: Thirty-Day Readmission Rate and Healthcare Economic Effects of Patients With Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement and Coexisting Chronic Congestive Heart Failure.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures have increased since adoption in 2010. Readmission for TAVR patients with underlying chronic congestive heart failure (cCHF) remains challenging. Therefore, we sought to determine the 30-day readmission rate (30-DRr) of patients who undergo TAVR & co-existing cCHF and its impact on mortality & healthcare utilization in the United States. We performed a retrospective study using the national readmission database year 2017 and 2018. The patients studied were discharged with TAVR as a principal diagnosis and underlying cCHF as a secondary diagnosis according to ICD-10 codes. The primary outcome was a 30-day readmission rate and mortality, while secondary outcomes were the most common diagnoses for readmission, and resource utilization. A total of 76,892 index hospitalization for TAVR with coexisting cCHF: mean age was 79.7 years [SD: ± 2], and 54.5% of patients were males. In-hospital mortality rate for index admission was 1.63%. The 30-DRr was 9.5%. Among the group of readmitted patients, in-hospital mortality rate was 3.13%. Readmission mortality showed a statistically significant increase compared to index mortality (3.13% vs 1.63%, adjusted P ≤ 0.001, aOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.6-2.9). The total healthcare in-hospital economic spending was $94.4 million, and total patient charge of $412 million. Approximately 1 in 10 patients who underwent TAVR with underlying cCHF had 30-DRr, with subsequent readmissions associated with increased healthcare spending. Readmission mortality showed a statistically significant increase when compared to index mortality. TAVR patients with cCHF are a vulnerable subset requiring additional outpatient care.
