Title: Sciatica secondary to deep venous thrombosis of the persistent sciatic vein: the first case in the literature. Illustrative case.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Sciatica usually results from lumbar nerve compression due to factors like disc herniations or lumbar canal stenosis. Despite its common causes, sciatic pain in a 52-year-old man following a coronavirus disease 2019 infection highlighted the importance of considering less common factors. Initially, minor disc protrusions were suspected as the cause of the symptoms, leading to the offer of surgery at another facility. The patient sought a second opinion, and our evaluation revealed a unique finding.
OBSERVATIONS: Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging uncovered varicose structures displacing the left sciatic nerve. Subsequent pelvic computed tomography angiography identified a remarkable finding-the lack of opacification in a left persistent sciatic vein ascending toward a left internal iliac vein, originating from a common internal iliac venous trunk-confirming a suspicion for deep venous thrombosis. These findings represented not 1, but 2, extremely rare and distinct variants in the venous anatomy. The authors promptly initiated anticoagulant therapy and tailored pain management strategies, observing progressive thrombosis resolution on follow-up imaging.
LESSONS: This report highlights the need for comprehensive diagnostics when symptoms and imaging differ. Misdiagnosis could lead to unnecessary surgeries and potential risks for the patient. https://thejns.org/doi/10.3171/CASE23652.
