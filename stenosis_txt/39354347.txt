Title: Clinical outcomes of drug-coated balloons dilatation for benign esophageal stricture.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Drug-coated balloons (DCBs) angioplasty is safe and effective for coronary artery disease. However, DCBs dilatation for the treatment of benign esophageal strictures is rarely reported.
PURPOSE: We aimed to report the clinical outcomes of DCBs dilatation for patients with benign esophageal strictures.
METHODS: From May 2020 to August 2023, 18 patients underwent DCBs dilatation for benign esophageal strictures. Baseline demographics were recorded and evaluated, including gender, age, comorbidities, stricture diameter and length, dilatation session, complications.
RESULTS: A total of 24 dilatation sessions of DCBs were performed, with a mean of 1.3 ± 0.6 sessions per patients (range 1.0-5.0). Dysphagia score decreased significantly after DCBs dilatation (2.6 ± 1.1 vs. 0.9 ± 1.3, p = 0.0002). Both stricture diameter and stricture index decreased significantly after DCBs dilatation (p < 0.0001). No procedure-related death, massive bleeding or esophageal perforation was observed during or after DCBs dilatation. Minor complications were found in only 3 patients (16.7%). All 18 patients were successfully followed up for a median period of 12.0 months. By the end of follow up, 10 patients showed no dysphagia, 6 patients showed mild dysphagia and 2 patients showed no improvement in dysphagia. The clinical success rate of DCBs dilatation is 88.9%.
CONCLUSION: DCBs dilatation may be a safe, effective and feasible treatment for benign esophageal strictures, and can be utilized as an alternative option after standard dilatation has failed. Prospective studies with large samples are needed to further validate its clinical efficacy.
