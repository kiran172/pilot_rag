Title: Intracoronary acetylcholine testing among 746 consecutive Japanese patients with angina-like chest pain and unobstructed coronary artery disease.

Abstract: AIMS : Intracoronary acetylcholine (ACh) testing is useful for the detection of epicardial spasm (ES) and coronary microvascular spasm (CMS). We retrospectively analysed the incidence of ES and CMS in consecutive Japanese patients with unobstructed coronary artery disease.
METHODS AND RESULTS: From January 1991 to February 2019, we performed intracoronary ACh testing of 1864 patients. Among these patients, a total of 746 consecutive patients (254 women, mean age 64 ± 11 years) who underwent first diagnostic angiography for suspected myocardial ischaemia and had unobstructed coronary arteries (<50%) were enrolled. Epicardial spasm was defined as ≥90% stenosis and usual chest symptoms and ischaemic ECG changes, while CMS was defined as <75% stenosis and usual chest symptoms and ischaemic ECG changes. We performed intracoronary ACh testing on both coronary arteries in 96% (716/746) of all subjects. Overall, ES was found in 329 patients (44%), whereas CMS was revealed in 40 patients (5%) including 4 patients with coexisting ES. In patients with ES, women made up 22%, and approximately three-quarters of the patients had resting chest pain. In contrast, women composed 65% (26/40) of those with CMS, and 15 patients with CMS had another chest symptom. Coronary microvascular spasm was frequently observed in the left coronary artery (LCA) but not the right coronary artery. Electrical cardioversion was necessary for two patients.
CONCLUSIONS : Coronary microvascular spasm was recognized in only 5% of consecutive Japanese patients with unobstructed coronary artery disease, whereas ES was revealed in 44% of those patients. Coronary microvascular spasm was often observed in women and in the LCA.
