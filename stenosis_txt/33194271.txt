Title: Surgical clip occlusion of the V3 segment to prevent recurrent cerebral infarction associated with extracranial vertebral artery dissection: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Recurrent cerebral infarction caused by traumatic extracranial vertebral artery dissection (EVAD) is treated medically and surgically. We report a case of EVAD that was treated using surgical clip occlusion of the V3 segment to prevent recurrent cerebral infarction.
CASE DESCRIPTION: A 48-year-old man was admitted for a cerebral infarction caused by EVAD and was treated using 200 mg/day cilostazol. Afterward, the cerebral infarction recurred. Digital subtraction angiography revealed that initial severe stenosis of the VA ostium resulted in the final occlusion and that collateral vessels to the VA remained. We continued antiplatelet therapy, but the cerebral infarction recurred due to thromboembolism of the collateral vessels. Parent artery occlusion was planned. We exposed the V3 segment of the VA and clipped it to prevent the recurrence of cerebral infarction.
CONCLUSION: Surgical clip occlusion of the V3 segment was effective for treating recurrent cerebral infarction caused by traumatic EVAD that had remained an issue despite continuing medical therapy.
