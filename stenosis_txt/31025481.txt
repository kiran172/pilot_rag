Title: Impact of COPD on outcomes in hospitalized patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation or surgical aortic valve replacement in Spain.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To describe the use of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) and conventional surgery (SAVR) among hospitalized patients with and without COPD, to compare the in-hospital mortality (IHM), length of hospital stay (LOHS) and cost between patients with COPD undergoing TAVI and SAVR and to identify factors associated to IHM among these patients.
BACKGROUND: TAVI would be expected to be less invasive and safer than SAVR among COPD patients.
METHODS: We analyzed patients whose medical procedures included TAVI and SAVR included in the Spanish National Hospital Discharge Database, 2014-2015. We stratified analysis by COPD status. Propensity score matching (1:2) was performed to assess the outcomes of TAVI vs. SAVR among COPD patients.
RESULTS: We identified 2,141 and 16,013 patients who underwent TAVI (27.60% with COPD) and SAVR (19.31% with COPD) respectively. For TAVI, we found no differences in IHM according to COPD status. Patients undergoing SAVR and suffering COPD had higher IHM than patients without COPD (adj.OR 1.32; 95%CI 1.10-1.58). After propensity score matching, IHM (8.35% vs. 5.83%, p = .040) and LOHS (18.62 days vs. 13.62; p < .001) were higher in COPD patients who underwent SAVR than those who underwent TAVI.
CONCLUSIONS: COPD patients undergoing TAVI did not have a worse prognosis compared to non-COPD patients during hospitalization. However, for SAVR, patients with COPD had significantly higher mortality than patients without this condition. COPD patients who underwent SAVR had higher IHM and LOHS than propensity score matched TAVI patients.
