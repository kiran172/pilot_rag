Title: Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion in male rats results in sustained HPA activation and hyperinsulinemia.

Abstract: Vascular contributions to cognitive impairment and dementia (VCID) is a spectrum of cognitive deficits caused by cerebrovascular disease, for which insulin resistance is a major risk factor. A major cause of VCID is chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH). Under stress, sustained hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) activation can result in insulin resistance. Little is known about the effects of CCH on the HPA axis. We hypothesized that CCH causes sustained HPA activation and insulin resistance. Male rats were subjected to bilateral carotid artery stenosis (BCAS) for 12 wk to induce CCH and VCID. BCAS reduced cerebral blood flow and caused memory impairment. Plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone was increased in the BCAS rats (117.2 ± 9.6 vs. 88.29 ± 9.1 pg/mL, BCAS vs. sham, P = 0.0236), as was corticosterone (220 ± 21 vs. 146 ± 18 ng/g feces, BCAS vs. sham, P = 0.0083). BCAS rats were hypoglycemic (68.1 ± 6.1 vs. 76.5 ± 5.9 mg/dL, BCAS vs. sham, P = 0.0072), with increased fasting insulin (481.6 ± 242.6 vs. 97.94 ± 40.02 pmol/L, BCAS vs. sham, P = 0.0003) indicating that BCAS rats were insulin resistant [homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR): 11.71 ± 6.47 vs. 2.62 ± 0.93; BCAS vs. control, P = 0.0008]. Glucose tolerance tests revealed that BCAS rats had lower blood glucose areas under the curve (AUCs) than controls (250 ± 12 vs. 326 ± 20 mg/dL/h, BCAS vs. sham, P = 0.0075). These studies indicate that CCH causes sustained activation of the HPA and results in insulin resistance, a condition that is expected to worsen VCID.NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Cerebrovascular disease and insulin resistance are two major risk factors for the development of dementia. Here, we demonstrate that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion results in glucocorticoid excess and hyperinsulinemia. This study indicates that chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, glucocorticoid excess, and insulin resistance participate in a detrimental cycle that could exacerbate cerebral vascular disease and dementia.
