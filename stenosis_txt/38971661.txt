Title: Assessment of Coronary Involvement with MDCT and Long-term Outcomes in Patients with Takayasu's Arteritis.

Abstract: RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: Takayasu's arteritis (TA) mainly affects the aorta and its branches involving the coronary arteries. Coronary CT angiography can be used to detect coronary artery lesions. Outcome of TA patients with coronary involvement has not been well established. Our study aimed to systematically analyze coronary lesions in patients with TA and to access long-term outcome in TA patients with coronary involvement.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort study of TA patients with coronary CT angiography was conducted between January 2009 and October 2021. Baseline clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters, imaging features and therapeutic features were collected and analyzed. Follow-up was scheduled since the onset of TA. Overall survival and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) were analyzed in patients with coronary lesions.
RESULTS: 48 (59.3%) TA patients had coronary involvement. Coronary ostial stenosis was detected in 31 (64.6%) patients by MDCT. Prevalence of disease activity (p = 0.007) was higher in patients with ostial stenosis. The median follow-up was 10.0 years. Death was observed in nine patients including seven died from myocardial infarction. TA patients with ostial stenosis had higher rate of MACE (p = 0.013). Baseline activity(HR: 5.250, 95%CI 2.004-8.639), ostial involvement(HR:8.954, 95%CI 3.875-56.038), stenosis≥ 70% (HR: 10.822, 95%CI 2.764-61.230) and activity recurrence (HR:11.913, 95%CI 2.321-85.747) were independently associated with increased major cardiovascular events.
CONCLUSION: MDCT should be performed in patients suspected with coronary involvement to make early diagnosis. Myocardial ischemia is the major cause of longterm death in TA patients with coronary lesions. Baseline disease activity, coronary ostial stenosis, stenosis ≥ 70% and activity recurrence were independent risk factors of cardiovascular events in TA patients.
