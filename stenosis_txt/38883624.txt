Title: Airway stent intervention in a high-volume center: safe procedures and educational perspectives.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Airway intervention, including stenting, can rapidly improve a patient's respiratory condition, but the procedure requires highly specialized techniques and expertise. Therefore, educating young endoscopists and passing on the techniques are major issues. However, the best way to educate new doctors on these techniques remains unclear. This study analyzed our educational system for airway intervention and its outcomes.
METHODS: Patients who underwent airway intervention regarding airway stents under general anesthesia in our department between January 2010 and September 2023 were included. The outcomes of interventions related to airway stents in our hospital were evaluated retrospectively, including from an educational perspective.
RESULTS: A total of 96 patients (76 undergoing stenting for airway stenosis, 8 stenting for airway-esophageal fistula, and 12 stent removal) were analyzed. The median experience level of the main physician was 5 (range, 1-17) years, and that of the supervising physician was 18 (range, 5-23) years. The median number of physicians who participated in the interventions was four. A rigid bronchoscope was used in 86.5% of cases. The procedure success rate was 95.8%. Intraoperative complications occurred in 8.3% and postoperative complications in 10.5% of cases, and there was 1 procedure-related death (1.3%). In the analysis of factors related to the development of complications, the years of experience of the main physician had no influence.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that our method of airway intervention is safe. Young endoscopists were able to master the technique by gaining experience under the supervision of experts.
