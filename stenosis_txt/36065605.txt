Title: Predictors of enteral tube dependence in pediatric esophageal atresia.

Abstract: Children with esophageal atresia (EA) may require enteral tube feedings in infancy and a subset experience ongoing feeding difficulties and enteral tube dependence. Predictors of enteral tube dependence have never been systematically explored in this population. We hypothesized that enteral tube dependence is multifactorial in nature, with likely important contributions from anastomotic stricture. Cross-sectional clinical, feeding, and endoscopic data were extracted from a prospectively collected database of endoscopies performed in EA patients between August 2019 and August 2021 at an international referral center for EA management. Clinical factors known or hypothesized to contribute to esophageal dysphagia, oropharyngeal dysphagia, or other difficulties in meeting caloric needs were incorporated into regression models for statistical analysis. Significant predictors of enteral tube dependence were statistically identified. Three-hundred thirty children with EA were eligible for analysis. Ninety-seven were dependent on enteral tube feeds. Younger age, lower weight Z scores, long gap atresia, neurodevelopmental risk factor(s), significant cardiac disease, vocal fold movement impairment, and smaller esophageal anastomotic diameter were significantly associated with enteral tube dependence in univariate analyses; only weight Z scores, vocal fold movement impairment, and anastomotic diameter retained significance in a multivariable logistic regression model. In the current study, anastomotic stricture is the only potentially modifiable significant predictor of enteral tube dependence that is identified.
