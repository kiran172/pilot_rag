Title: Antithrombotic Therapy After Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement: An Overview.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is an established procedure for the treatment of patients with severe aortic stenosis. The optimal antithrombotic regimen following TAVR, currently unknown and inconsistently applied, is impacted by thromboembolic risk, frailty, bleeding risk, and comorbidities. There is a quickly growing body of literature examining the complex issues underlying antithrombotic regimens post-TAVR. This review provides an overview of thromboembolic and bleeding events following TAVR, summarizes the evidence regarding optimal antiplatelet and anticoagulant use post-TAVR, and highlights current challenges and future directions. By understanding appropriate indications and outcomes associated with different antithrombotic regimens post-TAVR, morbidity and mortality can be minimized in a generally frail and elderly patient population.
