Title: Long- vs short-segment Barrett's esophagus-derived adenocarcinoma: clinical features and outcomes of endoscopic submucosal dissection.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The incidence of Barrett's esophageal adenocarcinoma (BEA) is increasing, and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) has been frequently performed for its treatment. However, the differences between the characteristics and ESD outcomes between short- and long-segment BEA (SSBEA and LSBEA, respectively) are unclear. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and short- and long-term outcomes of ESD between both groups.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 155 superficial BEAs (106 SSBEAs and 49 LSBEAs) treated with ESD in 139 patients and examined their clinicopathological features and ESD outcomes. SSBEA and LSBEA were classified based on whether the maximum length of the background mucosa of BEA was < 3 cm or ≥ 3 cm, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with SSBEA, LSBEA showed significantly higher proportions of cases with the macroscopically flat type (36.7% vs. 5.7%, p < 0.001), left wall location (38.8% vs. 11.3%, p < 0.001), over half of the tumor circumference (20.4% vs. 1.9%, p < 0.001), and synchronous lesions (17.6% vs. 0%, p < 0.001). Compared with SSBEA, regarding ESD outcomes, LSBEA showed significantly longer resection duration (91.0 min vs. 60.5 min, p < 0.001); a lower proportion of submucosal invasion (14.3% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.047), horizontal margin negativity (79.6% vs. 94.3%, p = 0.0089), and R0 resection (69.4% vs. 86.8%, p = 0.024); and a higher proportion of post-procedural stenosis cases (10.9% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.027). The 5-year cumulative incidence of metachronous cancer in patients without additional treatment was significantly higher for LSBEA than for SSBEA (25.0% vs. 0%, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: The clinicopathological features of LSBEA and SSBEA and their treatment outcomes differed in many aspects. As LSBEAs are difficult to diagnose and treat and show a high risk of metachronous cancer development, careful ESD and follow-up or eradication of the remaining BE may be required.
