Title: [A non-standard approach in the treatment of post-traumatic multifocal cicatricial tracheal stenosis with atresia of subglottic larynx, involvement of vocal cords and 33-year cannulation].

Abstract: The report presents a case of non-standard two-stage treatment of post-traumatic multifocal cicatricial tracheal stenosis with atresia of subglottic larynx, involvement of vocal cords, and 33-year cannulation. At the first stage, bougienage through a tracheostomy, endoscopic argon plasma exposure, circular tracheoglottic resection with tracheostomy and 3/<sub>4</sub> circle anastomosis, formation of a laryngotracheostomy with endoprosthetics were applied simultaneously. The second step was to eliminate the extensive fenestrated tracheo-laryngeal defect using titanium nickelide reinforcing implants. The individual algorithm made it possible to successfully eliminate complex tracheo-laryngeal stenosis with long-term cannulation and demonstrate excellent long-term treatment results.
