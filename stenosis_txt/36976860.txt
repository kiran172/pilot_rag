Title: Small bowel obstruction: what a gastroenterologist needs to know.

Abstract: PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Intrabdominal adhesions and intestinal hernias are the commonest cause of small bowel obstruction. Small bowel diseases, which cause small bowel obstruction, are rarer and often poses a challenge to gastroenterologists to diagnose and treat. In this review, small bowel diseases, which predispose to small bowel obstruction, are focused on, and their challenges in diagnosis and treatment.
RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnosis of causes of partial small bowel obstruction is improved with computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography. In fibrostenotic Crohn's strictures and NSAID diaphragm disease, endoscopic balloon dilatation can delay the need for surgery if the lesion is short and accessible; however, many may still inevitably require surgery. Biologic therapy may reduce the need for surgery in symptomatic small bowel Crohn's disease wherein the strictures are predominantly inflammatory. In chronic radiation enteropathy, only refractory small bowel obstruction and those with nutritional difficulties warrant surgery.
SUMMARY: Small bowel diseases causing bowel obstruction are often challenging to diagnose and require numerous investigations over a period of time, which often culminate with surgery. Use of biologics and endoscopic balloon dilatation can help to delay and prevent surgery in some instances.
