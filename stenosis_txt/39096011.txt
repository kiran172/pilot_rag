Title: Sequelae of carotid endarterectomy patch infection: An otolaryngologist perspective.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postoperative carotid endarterectomy (CEA) patch infection is a rare but well-recognized complication of CEA. It is important for otolaryngologists to be aware of the presentation and challenges in its diagnosis.
METHODS: Patients who presented with a neck mass or hemorrhage and a known prior history of carotid endarterectomy with synthetic patch reconstruction were worked up with ultrasound, CT, or MRI imaging. In one case, fine needle aspiration biopsy was performed. Ultimately, all patients were taken to the operating room for neck exploration.
RESULTS: Of the three patients presented in this case series, two presented with a chronic neck mass, two-to-three years after carotid endarterectomy. One patient presented acutely with hemorrhage from the carotid endarterectomy site. Carotid patch infection was diagnosed after neck exploration in all cases. Vascular surgery was consulted intra-operatively to perform definitive vascular repair.
CONCLUSIONS: Infected carotid patch should be suspected in patients with a history of prior CEA, as many of the presenting complaints may resemble or mimic pathology managed by otolaryngology. The onset of symptoms can be perioperative or very delayed. A multidisciplinary approach with vascular surgery and infectious disease is required for appropriate management of these patients.
