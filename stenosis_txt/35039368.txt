Title: Transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a patient with chronic type B aortic dissection.

Abstract: A 70s woman with a history of open-heart surgery presented with severe aortic stenosis (AS). CT showed chronic type B aortic dissection (TBAD) between the distal aortic arch and the left common iliac artery. After careful consideration, we planned transfemoral (TF)-transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) using a 20-Fr long sheath to minimise number of contacts with the false lumen of the aorta. TAVI was performed under general anaesthesia, guided by transoesophageal echocardiography (TEE). A transcatheter aortic valve was successfully implanted. TEE immediately after valve implantation showed no remarkable changes in the descending thoracic aorta. Repeated postprocedural CT examinations showed no obvious changes in the aorta. The patient was stable without sequelae at the 12-month follow-up. This case demonstrates that TF-TAVI using a long sheath under TEE guidance can be a treatment option for patients with severe AS and chronic TBAD.
