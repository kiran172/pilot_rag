Title: Low Serum Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide Level is Associated with Severity of Coronary Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate the relationship between the serum calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) level and severity of coronary stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 233 eligible patients who underwent coronary angiography were divided into two groups: a control and a coronary heart disease (CHD) group. The angiographic severity of coronary stenosis was evaluated by SYNTAX and Gensini scores. The incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events within two years was collected.
RESULTS: A negative correlation between serum CGRP levels and Gensini scores was observed in all patients (r=-0.352, p<0.001), the control group (r=-0.422, p<0.001) and the CHD group (r=-0.393, p<0.001). Serum CGRP levels were negatively associated with SYNTAX scores in the CHD group (r=-0.522, p<0.001). The area under the curve of CGRP for identifying high SYNTAX scores (>22) was 0.772 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.673-0.870, p<0.001], and for identifying high Gensini scores was 0.744 (95% CI: 0.646-0.842, p<0.001). A CGRP concentration of 25.05 pg/ml was selected as the cutoff point. A low CGRP level (<25.05 pg/ml) was an independent predictor of severe coronary stenosis, a SYNTAX score >22 [odds ratio (OR) =5.819, 95% CI: 2.240-15.116; p<0.001] and a high Gensini score (>64) (OR=4.943, 95% CI: 2.020-12.095; p<0.001). The low CGRP group had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events within two years (11.1 vs. 3.1%, p=0.031).
CONCLUSION: In coronary atherosclerosis patients without acute myocardial injury, serum CGRP levels were negatively associated with the severity of coronary stenosis.
