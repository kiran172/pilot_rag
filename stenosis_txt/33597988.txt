Title: Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation in 100 patients: a 10-year single-center experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI) is a non-surgical method of treatment for patients with right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) dysfunction after surgical repair of congenital heart defects (CHD).
AIM: To evaluate the long-term results of TPVI performed in a single center.Material and methods: Over 10 years, TPVI was performed in 100 patients (mean age: 26.4 ±8.1 years), using Melody Medtronic or Sapien Edwards valves.
RESULTS: The initial success rate of TPVI was 93%. In 7 cases (5 urgent), a switch to surgical intervention was necessary due to periprocedural complications (all patients survived). Following TPVI, none of the 93 patients had severe pulmonary regurgitation. The pulmonary gradient decreased from 49.0 ±37.8 before to 27.6 ±14.9 mm Hg directly after TPVI (p &lt; 0.0001). Right ventricular end-diastolic volume decreased, while NYHA class and pVO<sub>2</sub> uptake significantly improved in 1 year after TPVI. Freedom from reintervention was 100% in 1 year. Freedom from serious adverse events was 86% in mean 5.5 years of observation. The main reason for reintervention was infective endocarditis (IE) (1.6% patients/year). Increased risk of IE was associated with severe PS before valve implantation and the suboptimal result of TPVI. The incidence of IE seems to be lower in patients treated permanently with antiplatelet therapy (1.8% vs. 0.9% patients/year, NS).
CONCLUSIONS: TPVI is a safe and effective method of treatment in patients with RVOT dysfunction after surgical correction of CHD. To achieve a good outcome, precise patient selection and rigorous IE prevention are necessary.
