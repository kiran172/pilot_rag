Title: Celiacomesenteric trunk associated with superior mesenteric artery aneurysm: A case report and review of literature.

Abstract: In rare cases, the celiac artery and the superior mesenteric artery arise from a common origin known as a common celiacomesenteric trunk. Celiac trunk stenosis or occlusion has been reported to accompany this anatomical aberrancy. Even rarer, are aneurysms associated with this common celiacomesenteric trunk. In general, visceral artery aneurysms are uncommon. We hereby present a 39-year-old female patient with a 1-month history of mild diffuse abdominal pain, with an incidental finding of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm on abdominal ultrasound. Subsequent contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed severe narrowing of the celiac trunk and saccular aneurysmal dilatation of the superior mesenteric artery. Coil embolization of the aneurysm was performed, while maintaining persistent flow in the superior mesenteric artery and celiacomesenteric trunk. Visceral artery aneurysms are increasingly being identified incidentally with improvement in imaging techniques. The question lies whether to treat these aneurysms or observe. No universal guidelines exist regarding that matter, but the decision to intervene is made based on aneurysm location, size, and patient characteristics.
