Title: Risk of Stroke Recurrence After Intravenous Thrombolysis in Patients with Symptomatic Carotid Stenosis.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess if intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) affects the risk of recurrent preoperative cerebrovascular events before carotid surgery or stenting in patients with symptomatic ≥ 50% carotid stenosis.
METHODS: Three cohorts of symptomatic ≥ 50% carotid stenosis patients were merged. To make the control group relevant, we excluded patients not presenting with stroke on the day of symptom onset. The risk of preoperative cerebrovascular events up to 30 days was compared between the IVT-treated and non-IVT-treated.
RESULTS: In total, 316 patients were included, 64 (20%) treated with IVT. Those treated with IVT had similar risk of recurrent ipsilateral ischemic stroke or retinal artery occlusion (12% at day 7, 12% at day 30) as those not treated (9% at day 7, 15% at day 30; adjusted HR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4-2.2). There was a tendency (p = 0.09) towards time-dependency in the data where the recurrence risk was higher in IVT-treated at day 0 (6% in IVT-treated, 1% in non-IVT-treated, OR 5.5, 95% CI 1.2-25.4, p = 0.03). This was not significant when adjusting for co-factors (adjusted OR 4.4, 95% CI 0.9-21.8, p = 0.07) and was offset by a later risk decrease, with no remaining risk difference between IVT-treated and non-IVT-treated at day 7.
CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous thrombolysis treatment does not seem to affect the risk of recurrent ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with symptomatic ≥50% carotid stenosis: The risk is high in both IVT-treated and non-IVT-treated. However, there might be a risk increase on the day of IVT treatment that is offset by a risk decrease during the first week.
