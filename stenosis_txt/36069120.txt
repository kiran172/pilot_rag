Title: Development and validation of a prediction model for early mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) based on the Netherlands Heart Registration (NHR): The TAVI-NHR risk model.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The currently available mortality prediction models (MPM) have suboptimal performance when predicting early mortality (30-days) following transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) on various external populations. We developed and validated a new TAVI-MPM based on a large number of predictors with recent data from a national heart registry.
METHODS: We included all TAVI-patients treated in the Netherlands between 2013 and 2018, from the Netherlands Heart Registration. We used logistic-regression analysis based on the Akaike Information Criterion for variable selection. We multiply imputed missing values, but excluded variables with &gt;30% missing values. For internal validation, we used ten-fold cross-validation. For temporal (prospective) validation, we used the 2018-data set for testing. We assessed discrimination by the c-statistic, predicted probability accuracy by the Brier score, and calibration by calibration graphs, and calibration-intercept and calibration slope. We compared our new model to the updated ACC-TAVI and IRRMA MPMs on our population.
RESULTS: We included 9144 TAVI-patients. The observed early mortality was 4.0%. The final MPM had 10 variables, including: critical-preoperative state, procedure-acuteness, body surface area, serum creatinine, and diabetes-mellitus status. The median c-statistic was 0.69 (interquartile range [IQR] 0.646-0.75). The median Brier score was 0.038 (IQR 0.038-0.040). No signs of miscalibration were observed. The c-statistic's temporal-validation was 0.71 (95% confidence intervals 0.64-0.78). Our model outperformed the updated currently available MPMs ACC-TAVI and IRRMA (p value &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSION: The new TAVI-model used additional variables and showed fair discrimination and good calibration. It outperformed the updated currently available TAVI-models on our population. The model's good calibration benefits preprocedural risk-assessment and patient counseling.
