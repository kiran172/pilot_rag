Title: A Classic Pattern of Wellens Syndrome on ECG: A Case Report.

Abstract: Wellens syndrome is usually diagnosed in asymptomatic patients with normal or only slightly elevated cardiac enzymes. There are two different ECG patterns (Type A and Type B) described in the literature. Earlier studies demonstrated that the appearance of the Wellens pattern had a specificity of 89% and a positive predictive value of 86% for severe stenosis of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) hence a timely recognition and therapeutic approach may prevent fatal outcomes in the patients. Here we are presenting a case of a 69-year-old gentleman with chest pain and Type A Wellens Syndrome pattern on ECG who was found to have LAD stenosis.
