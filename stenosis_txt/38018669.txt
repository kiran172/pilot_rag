Title: Investigating the Association of Carotid Atherosclerotic Plaque MRI Features and Silent Stroke After Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The predictive value of carotid plaque characteristics for silent stroke (SS) after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations between carotid plaque characteristics and postoperative SS in patients undergoing CEA.
STUDY TYPE: Prospective.
POPULATION: One hundred fifty-three patients (mean age: 65.4 ± 7.9 years; 126 males) with unilateral moderate-to-severe carotid stenosis (evaluated by CT angiography) referred for CEA.
FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: 3 T, brain-MRI:T2-PROPELLER, T1-/T2-FLAIR, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and T2*, carotid-MRI:black-blood T1-/T2W, 3D TOF, Simultaneous Non-contrast Angiography intraplaque hemorrhage.
ASSESSMENT: Patients underwent carotid-MRI within 1-week before CEA, and brain-MRI within 48-hours pre-/post-CEA. The presence and size (volume, maximum-area-percentage) of carotid lipid-rich necrotic core (LRNC), intraplaque hemorrhage (Type-I/Type-II IPH) and calcification were evaluated on carotid-MR images. Postoperative SS was assessed from pre-/post-CEA brain DWI. Patients were divided into moderate-carotid-stenosis (50%-69%) and severe-carotid-stenosis (70%-99%) groups and the associations between carotid plaque characteristics and SS were analyzed.
STATISTICAL TESTS: Independent t test, Mann-Whitney U-test, chi-square test and logistic regressions (OR: odds ratio, CI: confidence interval). P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS: SS was found in 8 (16.3%) of the 49 patients with moderate-carotid-stenosis and 21 (20.2%) of the 104 patients with severe-carotid-stenosis. In patients with severe-carotid-stenosis, those with SS had significantly higher IPH (66.7% vs. 39.8%) and Type-I IPH (66.7% vs. 38.6%) than those without. The presence of IPH (OR 3.030, 95% CI 1.106-8.305) and Type-I IPH (OR 3.187, 95% CI 1.162-8.745) was significantly associated with SS. After adjustment, the associations of SS with presence of IPH (OR 3.294, 95% CI 1.122-9.669) and Type-I IPH (OR 3.633, 95% CI 1.216-10.859) remained significant. Moreover, the volume of Type-II IPH (OR 1.014, 95% CI 1.001-1.028), and maximum-area-percentage of Type-II IPH (OR 1.070, 95% CI 1.002-1.142) and LRNC (OR 1.030, 95% CI 1.000-1.061) were significantly associated with SS after adjustment. No significant (P range: 0.203-0.980) associations were found between carotid plaque characteristics and SS in patients with moderate-carotid-stenosis.
DATA CONCLUSIONS: In patients with unilateral severe-carotid-stenosis, carotid vulnerable plaque MR features, particularly presence and size of IPH, might be effective predictors for SS after CEA.
