Title: Subtraction coronary CT angiography in patients with high heart rate.

Abstract: All the previous subtraction coronary CT angiography (CCTA) had strict heart rate (HR) inclusion criteria. In this study, a new subtraction method was applied to patients with various HR. The post-contrast scan time was respectively 3.5 s after ascending aorta peak enhancement while HR &gt;80 bpm, 4 s while 65≤ HR ≤80 bpm and 4.5 s while HR &lt;65 bpm. Forty-six patients who underwent the new subtraction protocol were enrolled and patients were stratified into the high HR group (≥70 bpm) and low HR group (&lt;70 bpm). Eighteen patients with 15 severe calcification segments and 25 stent segments further received invasive coronary angiography (ICA). In all included patients, the coronary artery enhancement was compared between the high and low HR groups. In patients with ICA performed, the image quality improvement and diagnostic effectiveness for detection of significant coronary segments stenosis (&gt;50%) were compared between the conventional CCTA and subtraction CCTA and between the high HR group and low HR group, respectively. All enrolled patients got sufficient coronary artery enhancement. In patients with ICA performed, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that the area under the curve (AUC) for the diagnosis of significant stenosis was 0.93 in subtraction CCTA and 0.73 in conventional CCTA (p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in image quality improvement, specificity, positive predictive value and accuracy between the high HR group and low HR group. The new subtraction CCTA method broadened the clinical availability for patients with high HR.
