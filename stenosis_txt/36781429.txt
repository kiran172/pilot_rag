Title: Rescue aortic valvuloplasty for severe aortic stenosis is simple and effective in severely hemodynamically compromised patients presenting to centers without on-site heart surgery or TAVI facilities.

Abstract: Management of high-risk patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) is a challenging issue. The prognosis of patients with AS presenting with therapy-refractory pulmonary edema (RPE) or cardiogenic shock (CS) remains poor. The purpose of this study was to assess the 30-day mortality of rescue percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (PBAV) in AS patients presenting with RPE or CS in a community-based hospital without on-site heart surgery. From January 2016 to February 2019, we identified consecutively admitted patients with CS or RPE related to severe AS who underwent emergent PBAV. The primary end point was 30-day mortality. Secondary end points included procedural adverse events according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium (VARC)-2 criteria and predictive factors of the primary end point. We identified 51 patients with either CS (n = 22) or RPE (n = 29). All PBAV procedures were successful with a significant reduction in peak-to-peak gradient (median, [IQR] from 40 [27] mmHg to 15 [20] mmHg, p < 0.001). No procedural deaths occurred, while adverse events included stroke (4%), minor vascular complications (6%), minor (4%) and major bleedings (4%), and no life-threatening bleeding. Overall, 15 deaths (29%) were noted at 30 days after PBAV, while 53% of the surviving patients were successfully bridged to transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). 30-day mortality was significantly higher in the CS group compared to the RPE (n = 10 (45%) vs n = 5 (7%), p = 0.029), and was significantly associated with the presence of acute kidney injury (OR 9.09, 95% CI 2.13-38.77, p = 0.003) and elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.0-1.12, p = 0.047). Rescue PBAV in patients with severe AS presenting with RPE or CS is a feasible and effective therapeutic option, even in a community-based hospital without on-site heart surgery. Rescue PBAV resulted in 30-day survival of more than 70%, with more than half of the surviving patients having been successfully bridged to TAVI.
