Title: Clinical Outcomes and Angiographic Results of Bailout Stenting for Guide Catheter-Induced Iatrogenic Coronary Artery Dissection　- Impact of Stent Type.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Guide catheter-induced iatrogenic coronary artery dissection is a rare but feared complication. When it occurs, bailout stenting is widely performed; however, its prognosis and the impact of stent type remains unclear.
METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 77,257 consecutive patients (coronary angiography, 55,864; percutaneous coronary intervention, 21,393) between 2000 and 2015. We investigated the incidence, clinical outcomes, and angiographic results after bailout stenting and compared by stent type: bare-metal stent (BMS) and drug-eluting stent (DES). Iatrogenic coronary artery dissection occurred in 105 patients (incidence rate, 0.14%). All cases of iatrogenic coronary artery dissection that were recognized as requiring bailout procedure could be managed by stent implantation, and no patients died during bailout procedure. The 5-year cumulative incidences of cardiac death, target lesion revascularization, and major adverse cardiac events were 11.3%, 10.3%, and 21.0%, respectively. The binary restenosis rate was 10.4%, and it was not significantly different between BMS and DES implantation. In lesions with preprocedural stenosis, however, it was significantly lower in the DES group than in the BMS group. On the other hand, coronary artery dissection recurred in 8 patients, which was observed only after DES implantation.
CONCLUSIONS: The immediate and long-term outcomes of bailout stenting for iatrogenic coronary artery dissection were acceptable. Although DES may be favorable for stenotic lesions, coronary artery dissection can recur after DES implantation.
