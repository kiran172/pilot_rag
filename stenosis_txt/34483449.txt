Title: The Impact of Unilateral and Bilateral Eversion Carotid Endarterectomy on Postoperative Hemodynamic Parameters.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is an effective and safe treatment of stenosed carotid arteries, and is a preventive operation with well-defined indications. It is associated with a loss of the baroreceptor reflex and postoperatively increased hemodynamic parameters.
OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to confirm the sensitivity of baroreceptors and the impact on arterial pressure and heart rate in unilateral and bilateral eversion carotid endarterectomies.
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted with 30 patients treated with E-CEA in local anesthesia at the Clinic for cardiovascular surgery from December 2019 to May 2021, due to stenosis of the carotid arteries. Patients were divided into two groups: 15 patients in group A (patients with unilateral E-CEA; 15 patients in group B: patients with bilateral E-CEA).
RESULTS: Out of the total of 30 patients included in the research, 15 patients in groups A and B respectively, there were no statistically significant differences in regards to gender (p= 0,245) and preoperative risk factors: smoking (p=0,449); hypertension (p=0,388); diabetes (p= 0,714); hyperlipidemia (p=0.388), coronary disease (p=0.461) and symptomatic stenosis of the carotid arteries (p=0.449). Noted were the statistically significant differences in values of systolic and diastolic pressure on the 3rd postoperative days in patients with bilateral E-CEA (p=0,001; p=0,001), a statistically significant difference in the heart rate was not found in the analyzed groups in the postoperative period (p=0,225; p=0,994).
CONCLUSION: This study identified statistically significant differences in values of systolic and diastolic pressure in the early postoperative period. In his period, early detection and correction of these hemodynamic disorders are needed.
