Title: Sagittal balance parameters in achondroplasia.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is the main problem for adult achondroplasia (Ach). Sagittal imbalance of the spine may play a role in LSS causing neurogenic claudication in Ach patients.
RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study is to describe the sagittal balance parameters in Ach patients.
METHODS: A single-centre retrospective study of Ach patients that visited the Neurosurgery outpatient clinic of the Leiden University Medical Centre (LUMC) between 2019 and 2022 was performed. We defined sagittal imbalance by a C7 sagittal vertical axis (SVA) of more than 10 mm.
RESULTS: There were 13 patients with a spinal sagittal imbalance and 15 patients with a balanced spine. In both groups, the sacral slope (SS) was comparable (45.0° and 49.0°, p = 0.305), but exceeding the mean SS in non achondroplasts (38.0°). Lumbar lordosis (LL) was more pronounced in the balanced group (55.5° versus 41.7°, p = 0.019), and positively correlated to SS in contrast to the absence of a correlation in the imbalanced group. Thoracolumbar kyphosis (TLK) was increased comparably in both groups (19.6° and 24.6°), and far exceeding the TLK in non achondroplasts (circa 0°), and in both groups negatively correlated with the LL, although not enough to compensate for the smaller LL in the imbalanced group.
CONCLUSION: Only if the LL compensates for both a larger SS and TLK, the Ach spine can maintain sagittal balance. An explanation for the current data can be the failure of the lumbar spine to give sufficient lordosis due to degenerative processes.
