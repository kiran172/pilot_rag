Title: Acquired nasopharyngeal stenosis after radiation treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Nasopharyngeal stenosis (NPS) is a rare and morbid complication following radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. This review provides an update on management and prognosis.
METHODS: A comprehensive PubMed review using the terms "nasopharyngeal stenosis," "choanal stenosis," and "acquired choanal stenosis" was performed.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies identified 59 patients who developed NPS after radiotherapy for NPC. 51 patients underwent endoscopic nasopharyngeal stenosis excision by cold technique (80-100% success). The remaining 8 underwent carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) laser excision with balloon dilation (40-60% success). Adjuvant therapies included postoperative topical nasal steroids in 35 patients. The need for revision was 62% in the balloon dilation group, vs 17% in the excision group (p-value &lt;0.01).
CONCLUSION: When NPS occurs after radiation, primary excision of scarring is the most effective method of management with less need for revision surgery relative to balloon dilation.
