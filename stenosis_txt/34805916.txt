Title: Hemoptysis secondary to pulmonary vein stenosis after radiofrequency ablation for atrial fibrillation: A case report and literature review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Pulmonary vein stenosis (PVS) is a known complication after radiofrequency ablation of atrial fibrillation (RAAF) and is often misdiagnosed owing to lack of awareness regarding PVS among noncardiologists. Misdiagnosis results in unnecessary treatment; therefore, greater understanding of PVS can improve the management of these patients.
METHODS: We report the case of a 38-year-old man with a history of RAAF who presented with massive hemoptysis. His symptoms persisted despite undergoing transcatheter bronchial artery embolization on two occasions.
RESULTS: Pulmonary computed tomography angiography revealed a completely occluded left superior pulmonary vein. Considering the patient's history of RAAF, we diagnosed him with RAAF-induced PVS and performed left superior lobectomy after which hemoptysis did not recur.
CONCLUSIONS: Unexplained massive hemoptysis should alert clinicians regarding the possibility of RAAF-induced PVS. Balloon angioplasty and stent placement are used to treat PVS; however, their efficacy is controversial considering the high recurrence rates associated with these interventions.
