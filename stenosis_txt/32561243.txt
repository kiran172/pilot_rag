Title: Kounis Syndrome after Angioplasty of the Superficial Femoral Artery with Paclitaxel-Coated Balloon.

Abstract: Drug-coated balloons are used widely as a form of endovascular treatment for peripheral arterial disease, to improve patency by reducing neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis. We present a rare case of acute coronary syndrome secondary to anaphylaxis after inflation of a paclitaxel-coated balloon used to treat a recurrent superficial femoral artery stenosis.
