Title: A rare case of fibromuscular dysplasia involving multiple vascular beds.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Fibromuscular dysplasia rarely involves vessels other than the renal and carotid arteries. We present a case of a rare fibromuscular dysplasia involving multiple vascular beds in a young female patient with history of spontaneous coronary artery (SCAD).
METHODS: This is a case report with review of the literature using PubMed search for other cases of fibromuscular dysplasia that involves multiple vascular beds and its association with SCAD. The patient agreed to publish her case including her images.
RESULTS: Fibromuscular dysplasia involving multiple vascular beds in a young female patient with prior coronary dissection is rarely reported in the literature.
CONCLUSION: Fibromuscular dysplasia affecting multiple vascular beds is rare but should be suspected in patients with SCAD, particularly young female patients.
