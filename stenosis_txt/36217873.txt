Title: Diagnostic performance of dobutamine stress echocardiography: A South African experience.

Abstract: Dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) is a well-established modality for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease, but there are no reported diagnostic data in southern Africa. Objectives. To compare the safety, sensitivity and specificity of a South African (SA) DSE programme with larger, international series. Methods. All patients undergoing DSE from 2019 to 2021 at a single SA centre were included. A new wall motion abnormality (≥2 segments) signified inducible ischaemia. Results. A total of 106 patients (mean (standard deviation) age 61 (11) years, 68% male) were analysed. Six patients (6%) experienced chest pain during DSE and 4 (4%) developed an atrial arrhythmia. The sensitivity and specificity for epicardial coronary stenosis were 77% and 74%, respectively, changing to 82% and 72% when excluding those who had previous coronary artery bypass surgery. Conclusion. The sensitivity, specificity and safety of an SA DSE programme were comparable to international series. A DSE programme is feasible in a resource-constrained environment.
