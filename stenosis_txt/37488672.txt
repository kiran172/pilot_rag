Title: Prognosis and outcome of intrauterine treatment of fetuses with critical congenital heart disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intrauterine valvuloplasty is an innovative therapy, which promotes ventricular growth and function in some congenital heart diseases (CHDs). The technique remains challenging and can only be performed in a few centers. This study aimed to assess the feasibility and mid-term outcomes of fetal cardiac intervention (FCI) in fetuses with critical CHD in an experienced tertiary center.
METHODS: Five fetal aortic valvuloplasty (FAV) or fetal pulmonary valvuloplasty (FPV) procedures were performed in our fetal heart center between August 2018 and May 2022. Technical success was defined as crossing the aortic or pulmonary valve and balloon inflation, followed by evidence of increased blood flow across the valve and/or new regurgitation. Follow-up clinical records and echocardiography were obtained during the prenatal and postnatal periods.
RESULTS: Five fetuses received FAV or FPV, including critical aortic stenosis ( n = 2) and pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum ( n = 3). The mean maternal age was 33.0 Â± 2.6 years. The median gestational age (GA) at diagnosis was 24 weeks (range, 22-26 weeks). The median GA at intervention was 29 weeks (range, 28-32 weeks). All five cases underwent successful or partially successful procedures. One patient had pulmonary valve perforation without balloon dilation. No procedure-related deaths or significant complications occurred. However, one neonatal death occurred due to heart and renal failure. The median follow-up period was 29.5 months (range, 8.0-48.0 months). The four surviving patients had achieved biventricular circulation, exhibited improved valve, and ventricular development at the last follow-up visit.
CONCLUSION: Intrauterine FCI could be performed safely with good prognosis in critical CHD.
