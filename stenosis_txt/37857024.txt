Title: A simplified coronary model for diagnosis of ischemia-causing coronary stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The functional assessment of the severity of coronary stenosis from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR) has recently attracted interest. However, existing algorithms run at high computational cost. Therefore, this study proposes a fast calculation method of FFR for the diagnosis of ischemia-causing coronary stenosis.
METHODS: We combined CCTA and machine learning to develop a simplified single-vessel coronary model for rapid calculation of FFR. First, a zero-dimensional model of single-vessel coronary was established based on CCTA, and microcirculation resistance was determined through the relationship between coronary pressure and flow. In addition, a coronary stenosis model based on machine learning was introduced to determine stenosis resistance. Computational FFR (cFFR) was then obtained by combining the zero-dimensional model and the stenosis model with inlet boundary conditions for resting (cFFR<sub>r</sub>) and hyperemic (cFFR<sub>h</sub>) aortic pressure, respectively. We retrospectively analyzed 75 patients who underwent clinically invasive FFR (iFFR), and verified the model accuracy by comparison of cFFR with iFFR.
RESULTS: The average computing time of cFFR was less than 2 s. The correlations between cFFR<sub>r</sub> and cFFR<sub>h</sub> with iFFR were r = 0.89 (p &lt; 0.001) and r = 0.90 (p &lt; 0.001), respectively. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio for cFFR<sub>r</sub> and cFFR<sub>h</sub> were 90.7%, 95.0%, 89.1%, 76.0%, 98.0%, 8.7, 0.1 and 92.0%, 95.0%, 90.9%, 79.2%, 98.0%, 10.5, 0.1, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model enables rapid prediction of cFFR and exhibits high diagnostic performance in selected patient cohorts. The model thus provides an accurate and time-efficient computational tool to detect ischemia-causing stenosis and assist with clinical decision-making.
