Title: Endovascular Repair of Spontaneous Iliac Vein Rupture.

Abstract: Spontaneous iliac vein rupture is a relatively rare but fatal disease. Herein, 2 cases are reported. The two middle-aged and elderly females complaining of abdominal pain were admitted without any history of trauma. The computed tomography image both showed one huge hematoma in the lower abdominal cavity and the left external iliac venous thrombus. Venogram showed ruptures of the left external iliac vein and stenosis of the left common iliac vein after percutaneous mechanical thrombectomy. Stent grafts were implanted by endovascular technique. Favorable outcomes were achieved in both cases.
