Title: Association of aortic valve calcification with carotid artery lesions and peripheral artery disease in patients with chronic kidney disease: a cross-sectional study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) reportedly have a high prevalence of aortic valve calcification (AVC). In population-based studies, AVC is considered a manifestation of systemic atherosclerosis. The association of AVC with atherosclerotic lesions has not been fully investigated in predialysis patients. The present study was performed to determine whether carotid artery lesions and peripheral artery disease (PAD) are associated with AVC in patients with CKD not on dialysis.
METHODS: In total, 749 patients were included in this cross-sectional study. AVC was evaluated using echocardiography. Carotid artery lesions including carotid artery plaque (CAP) and PAD were simultaneously examined in each patient. A logistic regression analysis was applied to determine the factors associated with AVC.
RESULTS: AVC, CAP, and PAD were found in 201, 583, and 123 patients, respectively. In the multivariable analyses adjusted for covariates including the estimated glomerular filtration rate and makers of mineral metabolism (serum calcium, serum phosphorus, parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and fibroblast growth factor 23), AVC was significantly associated with the presence of CAP [odds ratio (OR), 3.37; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.43-7.95], the presence of PAD (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.10-2.81), the CAP score (per 1.0-point increase) (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.11), and the ankle-brachial blood pressure index (per 0.1-point increase) (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95).
CONCLUSIONS: AVC was associated with atherosclerotic lesions independent of kidney function and mineral metabolism. We consider that this association between AVC and atherosclerosis might reflect the burden of shared atherosclerotic risk factors.
