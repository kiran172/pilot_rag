Title: Ankle and toe weakness caused by calcified ligamentum flavum cyst: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ligamentum flavum cysts, which are most common in mobile junctional levels of the spine, can be a rare cause of spinal stenosis. There have been several case reports of ligamentum flavum cysts. However, there is yet to be a documented case report of a calcified ligamentum flavum cyst. Herein, we report the first case of a calcified ligamentum flavum cyst causing ankle and toe weakness.
CASE SUMMARY: A 66-year-old male visited our hospital complaining of claudication as well as thigh and calf pain in his left leg, all beginning two weeks prior. Physical examination revealed motor weakness of the left ankle dorsiflexion and great toe dorsiflexion. Lumbar spinal computed tomography scans showed spinal stenosis combined with a calcified mass at the left side of the L4-5 level. Magnetic resonance imaging showed dural sac compression caused by the calcified mass at the left ligamentum flavum of the L4-5 level. We performed decompressive laminectomy and excision of the calcified mass combined with posterior lumbar interbody fusion at the L4-5 level. Intra-operatively, we found a firm and nodule like mass originating from the ventral surface of ligamentum flavum. Pathological examination suggested a calcified pseudocyst without a capsular lining. After the operation, the patient's motor weakness in the ankle and great toe improved gradually.
CONCLUSION: The patient's ankle and great toe weakness were improved successfully after surgical removal of the calcified cyst.
