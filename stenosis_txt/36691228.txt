Title: Causes of Tearing in Patients With Chemotherapy: Meibomian Gland Dysfunction Versus Lacrimal Drainage Obstruction.

Abstract: Numerous ocular toxicities that have been associated with the use of chemotherapeutic agents present as problems with the ocular surface, ocular adnexa, and lacrimal system, and many chemotherapeutic agents have tearing as a side effect. In this study, 34 eyes from 17 patients with a mean age of 62.4±14.8 years were analyzed. Chemotherapy was administered for a mean of 13.8±7.6 months. Chemotherapeutic agents of the following types were included: titanium silicate-1 (58.8%), Docetaxel (23.5%), Paclitaxel (11.8%), and 5-fluorouracil (5.9%). Tearing began 9.1 to 10.9 months after chemotherapy treatment. Within 3 months of beginning chemotherapy, tearing occurred in 9 patients (52.9%), and within 6 months, it occurred in 11 patients (64.7%). Mean tear break-up time was 5.4±2.6 sec. Ten eyes (29.4%) had normal fluorescein dye disappearance test findings (within grade 1), and the mean fluorescein dye disappearance test was 1.91±0.87. Among the 34 eyes, 24 (70.6%) had normal puncta and 9 (26.5%) and 1 (2.9%) had stenosis and blockage, respectively. Ten eyes (29.4%) showed total regurgitation, 19 eyes (55.9%) showed partial regurgitation, and 5 eyes (14.7%) showed no regurgitation upon syringing. Four eyes (11.8%) and 30 eyes (88.2%), respectively, showed soft and hard stops upon probing. Dacryoscintigraphy confirmed that 6 eyes (17.6%) were normal, 8 eyes (23.5%) showed post-sac delay or obstruction, and 20 eyes (58.8%) showed pre-sac delay or obstruction. The mean meiboscores for the upper and lower eyelids on LipiView were 2.15±0.86 and 2.53±0.79, respectively. The difference in meiboscores between the upper and lower eyelids was significant ( P=0.004 ). Obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system is a significant contributing factor to tearing in chemotherapy patients. However, reflex tearing because of meibomian gland dysfunction should also be fully considered to effectively manage the tearing because of the high incidence of accompanying meibomian glands loss when the lacrimal drainage system is obstructed.
