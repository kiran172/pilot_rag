Title: Clinical outcomes of different types of metallic stents in malignant distal duodenum stenosis: A retrospective study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Endoscopic stenting at malignant distal duodenum stenosis (MDDS) is challenging because of the duodenal C-loop configuration, the acute angle of the duodenojejunal junction, and the limited length of the endoscope. Few studies have investigated the clinical outcomes of stenting at the distal duodenum. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the clinical outcomes of treating MDDS with different types of metallic stents.
METHODS: From January 2012 to December 2020, fifty-six patients with MDDS who underwent duodenal stenting were enrolled for analysis. Thirty-five patients received uncovered self-expandable metallic stents (UC-SEMS), and twenty-one patients received partially covered self-expandable metallic stents (PC-SEMS). All patients were followed up till death or for 18 months. The clinical success rate, stent dysfunction rate, and stent patency were compared between the groups. Multivariate analysis was conducted to identify factors related to stent dysfunction.
RESULTS: The clinical success rates were 85.7 % in both the UC-SEMS and PC-SEMS groups. Stent dysfunction rates (UC-SEMS: 34.3 %, PC-SEMS: 38.1 %, p = 0.773) and the average stent patency (UC-SEMS: 117.2 days, PC-SEMS: 100.0 days, p = 0.576) were not statistically different between the groups. Multivariate analysis disclosed the age ≥65 years was significantly related to stent dysfunction (odds ratio: 4.78, p = 0.031).
CONCLUSION: Both UC-SEMS and PC-SEMS are safe and effective treatment options for MDDS. However, stent dysfunction remains a significant issue to overcome, particularly in the elderly. Further research is needed to explore novel strategies that can improve the effectiveness of stent placement and reduce the risk of stent dysfunction.
