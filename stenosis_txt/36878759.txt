Title: Procedural and Surgical Interventions for Esophageal Stricture Secondary to Caustic Ingestion in Children.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Esophageal injury after caustic ingestion can vary in severity and may result in significant long-term morbidity due to stricture development. The optimal management remains unknown. We aim to determine the incidence of esophageal stricture due to caustic ingestion and quantify current procedural and operative management strategies.
METHODS: The Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) was utilized to identify patients 0-18 years old who experienced caustic ingestion from January 2007-September 2015 and developed subsequent esophageal stricture until December 2021. Post-injury procedural and operative management was identified utilizing ICD-9/10 procedure codes for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), esophageal dilation, gastrostomy tube placement, fundoplication, tracheostomy, and major esophageal surgery.
RESULTS: 1,588 patients from 40 hospitals experienced caustic ingestion of which 56.6% were male, 32.5% non-Hispanic White, and the median age at time of injury was 2.2 years (IQR: 1.4,4.8). Median length of initial admission was 1.0 day (IQR: 1.0, 3.0). 171/1,588 (10.8%) developed esophageal stricture. Among those who developed stricture, 144 (84.2%) underwent at least 1 additional EGD, 138 (80.7%) underwent dilation, 70 (40.9%) underwent gastrostomy tube, 6 (3.5%) underwent fundoplication, 10 (5.8%) underwent tracheostomy, and 40 (23.4%) underwent major esophageal surgery. Patients underwent a median of 9 dilations (IQR 3, 20). Major surgery was performed at a median of 208 (IQR: 74, 480) days after caustic ingestion.
CONCLUSION: Many patients with esophageal stricture after caustic ingestion will require multiple procedural interventions and potentially major surgery. These patients may benefit from early multi-disciplinary care coordination and the development of a best-practice treatment algorithm.
