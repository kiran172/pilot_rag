Title: Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis: A Surgical Mouse Model to Study Moyamoya Syndrome.

Abstract: Moyamoya is a cerebrovascular condition that predisposes affected patients to stroke and is characterized as the progressive stenosis of the internal carotid artery (ICA) and compensatory development of collaterals at the base of the brain. Patients with moyamoya syndrome also present with comorbidities such as various autoimmune diseases and coagulopathies. We developed a surgical method using micro-coils to induce ICA-specific stenosis in mice, which induces moyamoya-like vasculopathies. An advantage of this surgical model of hypoperfusion is that it can be combined with other comorbid models to investigate pathologies associated with moyamoya syndrome.
