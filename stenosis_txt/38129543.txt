Title: Hybrid surgery can improve neurocognitive function in patients with internal carotid artery occlusion.

Abstract: Internal carotid artery occlusion (ICAO) is a relatively uncommon but important cause of transient ischaemic attack and cerebral infarction. Hybrid surgery (HS) improves cerebral perfusion, but its impact on neurocognitive function has been controversial. Patients with symptomatic chronic ICAO treated by hybrid surgery or medical treatment from 2016 to 2019 were included. We recorded and analysed the clinical characteristics, angiographic data, outcomes and cognitive status. Functional assessments, including the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), the Barthel Index, and a battery of neuropsychological tests, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subtest (ADAS-cog), verbal fluency, and Colour Trail test Parts 1 and 2, were administered. Significant improvements in the ADAS (before, 7.5 ± 6.2 versus after, 5.2 ± 5.7; P = 0.022), MMSE (before, 25.5 ± 2.8 versus after, 28.1 ± 2.3; P = 0.013), and Colour Trail test Part 1 (before, 118.3 ± 26.5 versus after, 96.2 ± 23.1; P = 0.016) were observed six months after HS. Moreover, the abovementioned postprocedure scales were ameliorated in the HS group. This study found that in patients with multiple symptomatic ICAO and objective ipsilateral ischaemia, successful HS leads to improvement in the scores of three cognitive tests.
