Title: Post-tracheostomy complications: respiratory failure caused by authologic foreign body-case report.

Abstract: Tracheostomy is performed frequently as a palliative treatment in patients with end-stage respiratory failure (RF). However, in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation it may be difficult to recognize and can often lead to life-threatening RF. We present two cases of acute-on-chronic respiratory failure (ACRF) occurring in patients who had undergone tracheostomy [one with percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) and the second with surgical tracheostomy (ST)]. The first case was admitted due to ACRF several months after previous successful decannulation and the second case after failure of several attempts of weaning from tracheal cannula. In both cases, noninvasive mechanical ventilation assisted flexible bronchoscopy (NIV-FB) was able to identify and solve the tracheal stenosis secondary to stiff banana-shaped whitish foreign bodies. Histology sampling and genetic testing confirmed autologous foreign body formation-tracheal cartilage calcification. NIV-FB was found to be safe and effective in both diagnosis and treatment of the tracheal stenosis. Life-threatening RF connected with tracheal stenosis may be caused by rupture of tracheal cartilage ossification in patients with a history of ST and PDT. Bronchofiberoscopy performed with NIV will be a useful procedure to evaluate and treat the respiratory tract in patients with RF with suspected tracheal stenosis.
