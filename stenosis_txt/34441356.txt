Title: Pericardial NT-Pro-BNP and GDF-15 as Biomarkers of Atrial Fibrillation and Atrial Matrix Remodeling in Aortic Stenosis.

Abstract: AIMS: This study aimed to evaluate the association of GDF-15 and NT-pro-BNP in two different biological matrices with AF in severe aortic stenosis patients undergoing aortic valve replacement surgery (AVR), its association with atrial matrix remodeling, as well as with 30-day postoperative outcomes.
MAIN METHODS: One hundred and twenty-six patients between 2009 and 2019 with severe aortic stenosis undergoing AVR surgery in a tertiary hospital were assessed.
KEY FINDINGS: pericardial fluid GDF-15 and pericardial fluid and serum NT-pro-BNP were increased in AF patients with aortic stenosis. COL1A1 and COL3A1 gene expression increased when pericardial fluid NT-pro-BNP values were higher. TIMP4 was positively correlated with pericardial fluid GDF-15.
SIGNIFICANCE: GDF-15 and NT-pro-BNP in the pericardial fluid are biomarkers of atrial fibrillation in aortic stenosis and correlate with atrial matrix remodeling. AKI is predicted by both serum and pericardial fluid GDF-15.
