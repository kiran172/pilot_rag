Title: Partial Tricuspid Valve Stenosis during Device Closure of Perimembranous Ventricular Septal Defect.

Abstract: • Hemodynamic instability occurs during advancement of delivery sheath. • Tricuspid valve tethering creates tricuspid valve obstruction. • Right atrial distension and leftward deviation of the atrial septum occurs. • Hemodynamic instability reverses with loosening of the arteriovenous loop.
