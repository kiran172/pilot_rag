Title: Endovascular treatment of cervical myelopathy from brachiocephalic venous stenosis.

Abstract: Central venous stenosis is a rare cause of neurologic pathology. Here we present a case of brachiocephalic vein stenosis causing cervical myelopathy through venous engorgement. Our patient was a 51-y/o male who presented with ambulatory dysfunction so he was evaluated for cervical myelopathy. Imaging revealed cord compression from venous engorgement and brachiocephalic vein stenosis. He was treated with angioplasty and vessel stenting which significantly improved flow on postintervention imaging. In conclusion, preoperative vascular imaging should be considered in myelopathic patients as it can detect this rare but dangerous etiology.
