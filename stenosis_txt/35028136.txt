Title: Endovascular reconstruction of aortoiliac occlusive disease in a case with claudication and an ectopic pelvic kidney.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND IMPORTANCE: Ectopic kidney is a rare anomaly with an incidence of about 1 in 2500 birth in the population. Concurrency of pelvic kidney and iliac occlusion is rare, and the treatment is challenging because the pelvic kidney is associated with an atypical blood supply.
CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a 68-year-old man with aortoiliac stenosis, right pelvic kidney, and high-risk cardiovascular comorbidities. He presented with the right lower extremity claudication that has been present for four years. Computed tomography angiograms showed total occlusion of right common and external iliac arteries.
CLINICAL DISCUSSION: The old method for treating iliac artery stenosis is open surgery, which needs cross-clamping of the aorta. During this procedure, the chance of renal thrombosis and ischemia is high. Thus, the patient underwent an endovascular angioplasty that was done successfully for the patient without any disturbances in kidney function.
CONCLUSION: Traditional treatment of iliac artery stenosis, especially in patients with high-risk cardiovascular comorbidities, may be associated with complications. Endovascular intervention is a safe and effective approach for treating aortoiliac occlusion in patients with ectopic pelvic kidneys. More research and case series are needed to review the results and compare the success rate of this method versus open surgery.
