Title: Analysis of the efficacy and risk factors of surgical treatment of recurrent UPJO in adults.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: To compare the efficacy of secondary pyeloplasty and balloon dilation and to analyze the risk factors for secondary surgical failure in patients with recurrent uretero-pelvic junction obstruction (UPJO).
METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 65 patients with recurrent UPJO who underwent secondary surgery between September 2011 and March 2019, of whom 33 had complete baseline data and follow-up data. General clinical information, perioperative data, and follow-up results were collected from patients. Risk factors for surgical failure in patients with recurrent UPJO were analyzed using logistic regression.
RESULTS: The failure rates of secondary pyeloplasty and balloon dilation in secondary surgery were 16.7% and 33.3%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that ureteral stenosis length and operative time were associated with secondary pyeloplasty and balloon dilatation failure (p < 0.05), and ureteral stenosis length was an independent risk factor for secondary pyeloplasty failure (OR = 0.074, 95% CI: 0.006-0.864, p = 0.038). In the balloon dilation group, treatment failure rates were significantly lower in patients with stenotic segment lengths less than 1 ± 0.32 cm than in patients with stenotic segment lengths greater than 1 ± 0.32 cm (p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: The secondary pyeloplasty may provide better benefit. Ureteral stricture length is an independent risk factor for failure of secondary pyeloplasty and a potential risk factor for balloon dilatation. Operation time is a potential risk factor for pyeloplasty and balloon dilatation.
