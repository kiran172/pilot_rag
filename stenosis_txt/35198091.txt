Title: Percutaneous transhepatic stent for chronic intestinal bleeding from jejunal varices in primary idiophatic superior mesenteric vein stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Jejunal varices are a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. In most cases, they are due to portal hypertension related to liver cirrhosis, less frequently to superior mesenteric vein stenosis (SMV). In this article we describe an unusual case of a 61 year-old male patient who arrived at our emergency department with intermittent variceal bleeding due to jejunal varices causing melena and subsequent chronic anaemia. Patient was indeed discovered to have primary idiopathic superior mesenteric vein stenosis. We managed to treat this patient via SMV stenting through percutaneous transhepatic approach. In cases of upper-GI bleed with negative endoscopy for active bleeding, a contrast-enhanced CT scan should be performed to diagnose jejunal varices and their underlying cause, such as SMV stenosis which is best treated with percutaneous phlebography.
