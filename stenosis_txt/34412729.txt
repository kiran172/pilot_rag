Title: A child case of Kawasaki with giant coronary aneurysm: percutaneous coronary intervention due to anterior myocardial infarction.

Abstract: Kawasaki disease is usually self-limited, but it can lead to aneurysm, stenosis, thrombosis, and myocardial infarction in the coronary arteries. The most important complication of Kawasaki disease is coronary artery aneurysm. Coronary artery aneurysm or ectasia may be seen in 15-25% of patients who do not receive treatment. It develops in 5% of children who receive intravenous immunoglobulin at the appropriate time. Acute myocardial infarction is the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in Kawasaki patients with giant aneurysms. We present a 10-year-old girl who had a history of giant aneurysm in the coronary arteries and underwent percutaneous coronary intervention due to anterior myocardial infarction.
