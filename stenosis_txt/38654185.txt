Title: Alcohol consumption may be a risk factor for cerebrovascular stenosis in acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Atherosclerosis are well established risk factors for ischemic stroke, however the association between alcohol consumption and atherosclerosis is controversial. This study aims to explore the potential correlation between alcohol consumption and cerebral stenosis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA).
METHODS: Nine hundreds and eighty-eight patients with first acute ischemic stroke attack or TIA were recruited retrospectively. Alcohol consumption was classified into five consumption categories (non-drinkers, occasional drinkers, < 140 g per week [mild drinkers], 140-279 g per week [moderate drinkers], ≥ 280 g per week [heavy drinkers]). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) and digital subtraction angiography (DSA) were utilized to assess the carotid and cerebral artery in all patients. Five-step scale for degree of stenosis was applied: normal (0, 0 points), mild (< 50%, 1 point), moderate (50-69%, 2 points), severe (70-99%, 3 points), and occlusion (100%, 4 points).
RESULTS: The carotid and cerebral artery stenosis scores were positively correlated with moderate alcohol consumption (B = 1.695, P < 0.001). Compared with nondrinkers, moderate alcohol consumption had significant increasing risk of moderate carotid and cerebral artery stenosis (OR = 4.28, 95% CI: 1.47-12.49, P = 0.008) and severe stenosis (OR = 4.24, 95% CI: 1.55-11.64, P = 0.005) and occlusion (OR = 3.87, 95% CI: 1.65-9.06, P = 0.002). Compared with nondrinkers, heavy alcohol consumption patients had significant higher risk of carotid and cerebral artery occlusion (OR = 2.71, 95% CI: 1.36-5.41, P = 0.005).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher alcohol consumption may associate with higher risk and more severity of carotid and cerebrovascular stenosis.
