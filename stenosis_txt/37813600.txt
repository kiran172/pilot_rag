Title: Diagnostic Accuracy of Pre-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Nitroglycerin-Free Fractional Flow Reserve-Computed Tomography-Based Physiological Assessment in Patients With Severe Aortic Stenosis for Predicting Post-Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement Ischemia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Fractional flow reserve-computed tomography (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) has not been validated in patients with severe aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for coronary artery disease due to theoretical difficulties in using nitroglycerin for such patients.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this single-center study, we prospectively enrolled 21 patients (34 vessels) and performed pre-TAVR FFR<sub>CT</sub>without nitroglycerin, pre-TAVR invasive instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR) measurements, and post-TAVR FFR measurements using a pressure wire. The diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of pre-TAVR FFR<sub>CT</sub>≤0.80 to predict post-TAVR invasive FFR ≤0.80 were 82%, 83%, 82%, 71%, and 90%, respectively. A receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated an optimal cutoff of 0.78 for pre-TAVR FFR<sub>CT</sub>to indicate post-TAVR FFR ≤0.80, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84, and the counterpart cutoff of pre-TAVR iFR was 0.89 with an AUC of 0.86.
CONCLUSIONS: FFR<sub>CT</sub>without nitroglycerin could be a useful non-invasive imaging modality for assessing the severity of coronary artery lesions in patients with severe AS.
