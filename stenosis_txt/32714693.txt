Title: A Case of Isolated Intracranial Fibromuscular Dysplasia.

Abstract: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non-inflammatory, non-atherosclerotic disease resulting in stenosis and arterial wall weakening of typically medium-sized arteries. Intracranial aneurysm is an uncommon presentation of FMD, with a significant proportion presenting in the posterior circulation. Presented is the rare case of an adult female with left-sided stroke with angiographically-confirmed left middle cerebral artery FMD, with pan-scanning unremarkable for other demonstrable evidence of FMD. The patient's neurological deficits completely resolved. The patient was stable for discharge home on antiplatelet therapy.Â Appropriate imaging and screening should be performed to ensure FMD is localized versus systemic. Patients with intracranial FMD should be protected from cerebrovascular events with antiplatelet therapy.
