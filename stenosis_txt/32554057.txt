Title: Accelerated miniature swine models of advanced atherosclerosis: A review based on morphology.

Abstract: In order to accelerate development of atherosclerosis(AS) in miniature swine models, varieties of strategies and methods have been explored. In addition to traditional methods such as high cholesterol feeding and balloon injury, new methods such as familial hypercholesterolemia induced by gene editing and intramural injection have been applied in recent years. Although it has been claimed that these methods have successfully aggravated lesion areas and stenosis, lesion features induced by different strategies have shown heterogeneity in morphology. In addition, time consumption, high cost, and unavailability are problems that restrict application of these AS models. Here, we summarize strategies and methods to accelerate AS models and further analyze their values, advantages, and shortcomings.
