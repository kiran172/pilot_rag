Title: Efficacy of medical treatment and balloon angioplasty for severe intracranial atherosclerosis: a high-resolution MR vessel wall imaging.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To investigate the efficacy of medical treatment and balloon angioplasty for intracranial atherosclerosis using high-resolution MR vessel wall imaging (HR-MRI).
METHODS: In this prospective study, patients with symptomatic severe stenosis from January 2018 to August 2021 were treated with medical treatment or balloon angioplasty. The patients underwent HR-MRI at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Plaque characteristics at follow-up were compared with those at baseline using paired sample T-test or Wilcoxon rank sum test. The difference in the recurrence of ischemic events between two groups was compared.
RESULTS: A total of 37 patients (26 males; mean age = 60.5 ± 11.6 years) were evaluated. Of 68 plaques, 42 (61.8%) were treated with medication only. At 12 months of medical treatment, maximum plaque length (p = 0.004), maximum wall thickness (p = 0.036), and plaque enhancement (p = 0.001) were significantly reduced than baseline. At 3 months after balloon angioplasty, luminal stenosis (p = 0.048) was significantly reduced compared to baseline. At 6 months after balloon angioplasty, maximum plaque length (p = 0.011), maximum wall thickness (p = 0.003), and luminal stenosis (p = 0.001) were significantly reduced than baseline. No difference was found in the recurrence of ischemic events between two groups (p = 0.458).
CONCLUSION: Intracranial atherosclerotic plaque shrank and tended to be stable at 12 months of medical treatment. Plaque burden was significantly reduced 6 months after balloon angioplasty. This may provide evidence for the application and selection of treatment strategies for intracranial atherosclerotic disease.
KEY POINTS: • Plaque burden and plaque enhancement were significantly reduced at 12 months of medical treatment compared to baseline. • Plaque burden was significantly reduced at 6 months after balloon angioplasty compared with baseline. • No significant difference in the recurrence rate of ischemic stroke between patients treated with medication and balloon angioplasty.
