Title: Endovascular therapies for hepatic artery stenosis post liver transplantation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To evaluate primary patency at 12 months after endovascular therapies in hepatic artery stenosis.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all endovascular interventions for hepatic artery stenosis (HAS) after liver transplantation that occurred between June 2013 and November 2020 was performed at a single institution in France. Follow up occurred from 1 month to 4 years (median 15 months). The treatment consisted of dilation with a balloon or stent. We analyzed short-term (technical success and complications) and long-term outcomes (liver function, arterial patency, graft survival at 12 months (GS), and reintervention). We also compared percutaneous balloon angioplasty (PBA) with stent placement. PBA alone was used if < 30% residual stenosis of the hepatic artery was achieved. Stenting was performed if there was greater than 30% residual stenosis and in the case of complications (dissection or rupture).
RESULTS: A total of 18 stenoses were suspected on the basis of routine surveillance duplex ultrasound imaging (peak systolic velocity > 200 cm/s, systolic accelerating time > 10 ms and resistive index < 0.5), all of which were confirmed by angio CT, but only 17 were confirmed by angiography. Seventeen patients were included (14 males, mean age 57 years; and three females, mean age 58 years). Interventions were performed in 17 cases (95%) with PBA only (5/17), stent only (5/17) or both (4/17). Immediate technical success was 100%. Major complications occurred in 1 of 17 cases (5.8%), consisting of target vessel dissection. The analysis of the three (groups PBA only, stent only or both) showed the same procedural success (100%), GS (100%) and normal liver function after the procedures but different rates of complications (20% vs. 0% vs. 0%), arterial patency at 12 months (60% vs. 80% vs. 85%) (p = 0.4), early stenosis (40% vs. 80% vs. 0%) or late stenosis (60% vs. 20% vs. 100%) and requirement for reintervention (40% vs. 20% vs. 14%) (p = 0.56).
CONCLUSION: This study suggests that PBA, stent, or both procedures show the same primary patency at 12 months. It is probably not a definitive answer, but these treatments are safe and effective for extending graft survival in the context of graft shortages.
