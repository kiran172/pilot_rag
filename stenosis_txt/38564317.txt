Title: Extent of cardiac damage and hospitalization burden in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac damage has gained increasing attention as a valid prognostic marker of mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). However, studies investigating the possible association between cardiac damage and hospitalization burden in TAVR patients are lacking.
AIMS: This study aimed to investigate the impact of baseline cardiac damage on the hospitalization burden before, during, and after TAVR in an all-comers population.
METHODS: All consecutive patients who underwent TAVR between 2016 and 2020 were included. Electronic medical records of all patients were examined to validate cardiovascular (CV) and heart failure (HF) related hospitalizations from 6 months before to 1 year after TAVR. Baseline cardiac damage was defined according to the staging classification by Généreux et al. RESULTS: Among 1397 TAVR patients, 94 (6.7%) had stage 0, 368 (26.4%) stage 1, 736 (52.7%) stage 2, 115 (8.2%) stage 3, and 84 (6.0%) stage 4 cardiac damage. Patients with more advanced cardiac damage at baseline had more HF hospitalizations within 6 months before TAVR (p < 0.01) and with a longer length of stay (LoS) (p < 0.01). Regarding the index TAVR admission, there was no difference in procedure time (p = 0.26) or LoS (p = 0.18) between groups. Still, TAVR patients with more advanced baseline cardiac damage had a higher risk of CV and HF rehospitalization after TAVR (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Baseline cardiac damage in patients undergoing TAVR has an impact on the pre- and post-procedural cardiovascular hospitalization burden. However, the cardiac damage status does not affect the TAVR procedure time or index TAVR admission length of stay.
