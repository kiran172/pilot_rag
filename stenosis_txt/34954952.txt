Title: [Surgical tracheoplasty for children with congenital tracheal stenosis undergoing previous balloon dilatation or tracheal metal stent placement: a series of 9 cases].

Abstract: Objective: To examine the outcomes of Slide tracheoplasty for the children with severe congenital tracheal stenosis received previous repeated balloon dilatation or metal stent placement under endoscopy. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in 9 children with congenital tracheal stenosis undergoing previous interventional therapy under tracheoscopy and later received Slide tracheoplasty due to obvious respiratory symptoms at Department of Cardiac Surgery, Qilu Children's Hospital of Shandong University between February 2017 and July 2021. There were 7 males and 2 females with a median age at operation of 72.4 months (range: 13.3 to 98.9 months), and the median weight was 19.0 kg (range: 9.0 to 33.0 kg). Among the 9 patients, 2 patients began to receive repeated balloon dilatation (more than 3 times) 17.8 and 51.8 months ago respectively. One patient received metal stents placement into the trachea for 4 days and the other 6 children for median 56.8 months (range: 21.6 to 74.2 months). Complete tracheal cartilage rings and long segmental stenosis were present. in all 9 children. Operative details and outcome measures, including the need for endoscopic airway intervention and mortality, were collected. Results: Slide tracheoplasty was performed in all cases. Two patients with repeated balloon dilatation had different thickness of tracheal wall, local scar hyperplasia and irregular lumen. Among them, 1 case had obvious local calcification of tracheal wall, which was difficult to suture. The metal stent in one patient with short time of placement was completely removed. However, only part of the metal stents could be removed due to the long placement time in the other 6 cases. There was no operative death in the 9 children. The median postoperative tracheal intubation time was 25.3 hours (range: 17.4 to 74.5 hours). A silicone stent was placed in the trachea of 1 child due to obvious respiratory symptoms. Follow-up of median 11 months (range: 1 to 23 months) showed that no death occurred after discharge and all children had basically normal activity tolerance with no obvious respiratory symptoms. Conclusions: Slide tracheoplasty is feasible for children undergoing prior balloon dilatation or metal stents placement. Previously repeated balloon dilatation or metal stent placement under endoscopy increased the difficulty of slide tracheoplasty, the metal stent could not be completely removed after a long time.
