Title: Short-and-Long-Term Outcomes after Coronary Rotational Atherectomy in Patients Treated with Trans-Catheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common finding among patients undergoing trans-catheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI), who often present severely calcified coronary lesions. Evidence is scarce about the use of rotational atherectomy (RA) in this setting, in particular regarding long-term outcome.
METHODS: RA was performed on severely calcified coronary lesions concomitant with TAVI in a consecutive series of patients treated between 2010 and 2020. Immediate and long-term clinical outcomes are reported.
RESULTS: A concomitant CAD (coronary stenosis visually > 50%) was observed in 402/845 (47.6%) consecutive patients undergoing TAVI at the University Hospital of Verona. Angioplasty was performed in 104 patients (12.3%). Among these, 19 patients (18.3%, 20 coronary arteries), were treated with RA after TAVI: 10 after implantation of a balloon-expandable trans-catheter valve and 9 after a self-expandable valve. All procedures were successful. Hypotension occurred in 3 patients (15.8%), with rapid recovery after the procedure; CI-AKI (contrast-induced acute kidney injury) in 3 patients (15.8%), of which two recovered within discharge. At a median follow-up of 21.5 months (Q1-3: 6-36) event free survival was 83.3%. Only one patient suffered a target vessel failure >2 years after RA. Neither stroke nor peri-procedural infarctions were detected.
CONCLUSIONS: RA concomitant with TAVI was feasible and safe in patients treated with implantation of either self-expandable, or balloon-expandable trans-catheter aortic valves. Long-term clinical events related to the coronary procedure were extremely infrequent and the survival rate at median follow-up of 21.5 months was 83.3%.
