Title: Obstructing Granuloma in Main Pulmonary Trunk.

Abstract: A patient with main pulmonary artery mass may have severe symptoms and warrants urgent surgical management, whereas in a stable patient with a diagnosis amenable to medical treatment, medical management should be started while monitoring the size of the lesion. We report a case in which the patient experienced severe right heart dysfunction due to obstruction of the main pulmonary artery, diagnosed as a probable thrombus, and the patient was taken for urgent surgical excision, later diagnosed as tuberculoma on histopathologic examination.
