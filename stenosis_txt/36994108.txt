Title: Tracheal stenosis following tracheotomy in a COVID-19 patient.

Abstract: Hemodialyzed patients with COVID-19 are at risk for severe complications from acute respiratory distress syndrome, requiring admission to the intensive-care unit for invasive mechanical ventilation. Post tracheotomy stenosis can be a life-threatening condition that commonly occurs after iatrogenic injury secondary to tracheotomy or tracheal intubation. We report a case of a 44-year-old female patient on maintenance haemodialysis who presented a COVID-19-related ARDS that required mechanical ventilation for 4 weeks, followed by a persistent stridor and finally succumbed, 1 month after being discharged from intensive care unit, from a severe respiratory distress due to a tracheal stenosis. Our aim is to highlight the importance of the early recognition and management of post tracheotomy stenosis in patients with persistent respiratory difficulty as stridor after prolonged intubation requiring tracheotomy, in order to improve the prognosis of these patients.
