Title: Long-term Clinical and Hemodynamic Outcomes of Edge-to-Edge Repair for Tricuspid Regurgitation.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The edge-to-edge technique (Alfieri stitch) has been widely adopted in mitral valve but not tricuspid valve (TV) repair. We evaluated long-term clinical and hemodynamic outcomes of tricuspid edge-to-edge repair.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 237 patients (mean age, 58.4 ± 13.9 years) who had undergone tricuspid edge-to-edge repair from January 2001 to March 2019 in our institution. Tricuspid annuloplasty was performed in 175 patients (73.8%) using ring (91 [38.4%]) or suture (84 [35.4%]) annuloplasty. Concomitant procedures were mitral valve replacement (133 [56.1%]), mitral valve repair (52 [21.9%]), aortic valve replacement (41 [17.3%]), and maze operation (138 [58.2%]).
RESULTS: Postoperative echocardiography revealed mild or less tricuspid regurgitation (TR) in 220 patients (92.8%). Early mortality (<30 days) occurred in 9 patients (3.8%), reoperation for bleeding in 16 (6.8%), and low cardiac output syndrome in 15 (6.4%). Freedom from all-cause mortality was 87.2% at 5 years and 80.6% at 10 years. Freedom from moderate or severe TR was 97.1% at 5 years and 84.9% at 10 years. Transtricuspid pressure gradient was 3.8 ± 4.2 mm Hg at discharge and 3.2 ± 5.6 mm Hg at the last follow-up (P = .60). Freedom from significant tricuspid stenosis (transtricuspid pressure gradient ≥5 mm Hg) was 96.4% and 88.4% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. There was 1 early TV reoperation for severe TR on postoperative day 3 (0.4%). Freedom from TV reoperation was 99.1% at 10 years.
CONCLUSIONS: Tricuspid edge-to-edge repair showed acceptable long-term clinical and hemodynamic results and is an effective and safe option in TV surgery.
