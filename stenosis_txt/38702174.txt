Title: Efficacy Analysis of Pneumocystoscopic Cohen Surgery for Lower Ureteral Lesions in Children.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the clinical effects, safety, and recovery associated with minimally invasive pneumocystoscopic ureterovesical reimplantation (Cohen) compared to open surgery for treating lower ureteral lesions in children.
METHODS: The data of 60 sick children with lower ureteral lesions were retrospectively analyzed, who underwent ureterovesical reimplantation in our hospital from January 2017 to June 2022. All of them went through a Cohen procedure. Sixty children were divided into two groups according to surgical approaches: open surgery group (n=30) and pneumocystoscopic group (n=30). There were 26 boys and 4 girls in the open surgery group, aged from 3 months and 7 days old to 8 years and 5 months old, with 18 cases of lower ureteral stenosis and 12 cases of ureteral reflux, while there were 20 boys and 10 girls in the pneumocystoscopic group, aged from 7 months and 2 days old to 10 years and 9 months old, with 18 cases of lower ureteral stenosis and 12 cases of ureteral reflux. We retrospectively analyzed data from 60 children, comparing outcomes such as intraoperative complications, postoperative recovery, and long-term efficacy between open surgery and pneumocystoscopic approaches.
RESULTS: The pneumocystoscopic group exhibited smaller surgical incisions, reduced intraoperative bleeding, and shorter hospital stays compared to the open surgery group, although the operation duration was longer. Both groups showed similar postoperative ureter diameters and long-term recovery, with minimal occurrences of ureteral reflux relapse.
CONCLUSION: Pneumocystoscopic ureterovesical reimplantation (Cohen) demonstrated safety, efficacy, minimal invasiveness, and faster recovery in treating lower ureteral lesions in children, with aesthetic benefits and fewer complications, making it a promising approach for pediatric urological surgeries.
