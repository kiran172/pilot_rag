Title: Acute myocardial infarction occurring after hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: a case report.

Abstract: Atheromatous plaque rupture and coronary artery stenosis/occlusion are leading causes of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Other reasons for AMI are frequently overlooked. We report a rare case of AMI occurring after hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Although the patient showed multiple lead ST-T changes on an electrocardiogram and elevated circulating cardiac troponin I concentrations, no stenotic lesions were observed by repeated invasive coronary angiography examinations. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was suspected as the primary cause of AMI. The patient received radiofrequency catheter ablation therapy and was free of atrial fibrillation and myocardial infarction 1 year postoperatively. The clinical management and outcome of the patient are also discussed.
