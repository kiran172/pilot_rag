Title: The Role of Circular RNAs in Ischemic Stroke.

Abstract: Ischemic stroke (IS), a devastating condition characterized by intracranial artery stenosis and middle cerebral artery occlusion leading to insufficient oxygen supply to the brain, is a major cause of death and physical disability worldwide. Recent research has demonstrated the critical role of circular RNAs (circRNAs), a class of covalently enclosed noncoding RNAs that are widespread in eukaryotic cells, in regulating various physiological and pathophysiological cellular processes, including cell apoptosis, autophagy, synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation. In the past few years, circRNAs have attracted extensive attention in the field of IS research. This review summarizes the current understanding of the mechanisms underlying the involvement of circRNAs in IS development. A better understanding of circRNA-mediated pathogenic mechanisms in IS may pave the way for translating circRNA research into clinical practice, ultimately improving the clinical outcomes of IS patients.
