Title: Clinical risk factors and features on computed tomography angiography in high-risk carotid artery plaque in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: High-risk carotid artery plaque (HPR) is associated with a markedly increased risk of ischemic stroke. The aims of this study were: 1) to examine the prevalence of HRP in a cohort of asymptomatic adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D); 2) to investigate the relationship between HRP, established cardiovascular risk factors and computed tomography angiography (CTA) profile; and 3) to assess whether the presence of HRP is associated with an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE).
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of T2D asymptomatic patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) from January 2018 to July 2021. The carotid atherosclerotic plaque (CAP) was assessed for the presence of ulceration, the presence of lipids, fibrosis, thrombotic deposits, hemorrhage, neovascularization, and inflammation. A CAP presenting at least five of these histological features was defined as a HRP (Group A); in all other cases it was defined as a mild to moderate heterogeneous plaque and no-HRP (Group B). CTA features included the presence of rim sign consisting of thin peripheral adventitial calcification (<2 mm) and internal soft plaque (≥2 mm), NASCET percent diameter stenosis, maximum plaque thickness, ulceration, calcification, and intraluminal thrombus were recorded. Binary logistic regression with Uni- and Multivariate was used to evaluate possible predictors for HRP while multivariable Cox Proportional Hazards was used to assess independent predictors for MACE.
RESULTS: One hundred eighty-five asymptomatic patients (mean age 73±8 years, 131 men), undergoing carotid endarterectomy, were included. Of these, 124 (67%) had HRP, and the 61 (33%) did not. Diabetic complications (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.1, P=0.01), NASCET stenosis ≥75% (OR 2.4, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7, P=0.02) and carotid RIM sign (OR 4.3, 95% CI: 3.9-7.3, P<0.001) were independently associated with HRP. However, HRP was not associated with a higher risk of MACE (freedom from MACE at 5 years: HRP 83.4% vs. non HRP 87.8%, P=0.72) or a reduction of survival (5-year survival estimates: HRP 96.4% vs. non HRP: 94.6%, P=0.76).
CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of HRP (67%) was observed in asymptomatic and elderly T2D patients. Independent predictors of HRP were diabetic complications, NASCET stenosis ≥75% and carotid RIM sign (OR 4.3, 95% CI: 3.9-7.3, P<0.001). HRP was not associated with an increased risk of MACE during a mean follow-up of 39±24 years.
