Title: Salvage PTBD in post living donor liver transplant patients with biliary complications-a single centre retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To study the outcome of salvage percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) in complex and technically challenging post-liver transplant (LT) biliary complications and analyse the reason for failure of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP).
METHODS AND MATERIALS: Hospital data were searched for all LT patients with biliary complications requiring salvage PTBD (upon failure of ERCP) from January 2010 to May 2017. Patients who underwent primary PTBD were excluded. Patients clinical and biochemical parameters were analysed for clinical, biochemical and imaging response, stent-free survival and the reason for ERCP failure.
RESULTS: Salvage PTBD was performed in 32 patients with post-LT biliary stricture/bile leak presenting with deranged liver function in 12 (37.5%), cholangitis in 12 (37.5%) and cholangitis with cholangitic abscess in remaining 8 (25%) patients. Of 32 patients, 20 (62.5%) already had plastic biliary stent placed by ERCP, while in remaining (n = 12, 37.5%) a wire could not be negotiated across stricture by ERCP. These patients were found to have long/tortuous stricture (n = 18, 56.3%) and multiple duct disconnection at anastomosis (n = 14, 43.7%). Immediate as well as sustained (persisting for a year or more) clinical and biochemical improvement was seen in 26 (81.3%) patients, while failure of resolution of sepsis and death occurred in remaining 6 (18.8%).
CONCLUSION: Salvage PTBD is an effective treatment in difficult-to-treat post-LT biliary strictures with deranged liver functions with or without cholangitis/cholangitic abscess. It can reduce graft loss with improved clinical outcome. Post-LT ductal anatomy at anastomosis is important to decide the appropriate approach (ERCP/PTBD).
ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE: (1). PTBD as a salvage procedure in difficult anatomy or upon failure of ERCP-based intervention is effective and a good alternative strategy. (2). Postoperative surgical anatomy (type & length of stricture, number of ductanastomosis, location and graft-recipient duct alignment) is the key factor indeciding the appropriate therapeutic procedure.
