Title: Evaluating the Academic Influence of Orthopedic Surgeons in Spinal Literature Through Relative Citation Ratio.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION:  The innovative iCite tool applies the relative citation ratio (RCR) to gauge the time and field-adjusted scientific influence of a publication. This study examines scholarly effects on spine surgery to distinguish the impact made by orthopedic surgeons, neurosurgeons, and several other specialists.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:  From 2013 to 2017, 100 of the highest RCR-rated articles were gathered for each of the following terms: cervical disc herniation (CDH), lumbar disc herniation (LDH), lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS), neurogenic claudication (NC), radiculopathy (RAD), and sciatica (SC). The first, second, and last authors were queried for background and academic qualifications and placed into the following specialty categories: orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, pain management, medicine, and others. To provide an alternative degree of influence, the Scopus database was employed to classify the h-index associated with each author.
RESULTS:  Across the six search terms, there were 526 orthopedic surgeons among 1,730 authors (30.4%), with the highest representation in LSS (118/290, 40.7%), and the lowest in SC (45/286, 15.7%). Orthopedics was the most influential specialty across all six research terms by median RCR (p = 0.012). Compared to their neurosurgical counterparts, orthopedic authors had a greater influence in CDH (3.93 vs. 2.63, p = 0.0492), LDH (5.10 vs. 4.99, p = 1.0000), NC (2.16 vs. 1.40, p = 0.2370), and SC (3.35 vs. 3.04, p = 0.5285), but had a lower influence in LSS (5.13 vs. 5.32, p = 0.7736) and RAD (5.03 vs. 6.05, p = 0.3938).
CONCLUSION:  Orthopedic surgeons lead other specialties when determining scholarly influence through RCR across six of the pre-designated research domains within spine surgery. For orthopedics, a modest influence in LSS and RAD may suggest potential areas of future focus. The use of bibliometrics to analyze available literature enables us to identify other specialties that have contributed to our field and promote interdisciplinary collaboration.
