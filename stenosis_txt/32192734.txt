Title: Corticosteroid injection of impassable caustic esophageal strictures without dilatation: Does it pave the way to interval endoscopic dilatation?

Abstract: BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Endoscopic dilatation of caustic esophageal stricture is the mainstay of therapy. The need for esophageal replacement has decreased over the past decades owing to advancement in techniques of dilatation. In this study, we aimed to assess our results of four-quadrant corticosteroid injection of impassable caustic esophageal strictures followed by a trial endoscopic dilatation.
METHODS: During the period from June 2003 to May 2017, in 340 patients in whom a trial of endoscopic dilatation after corrosive ingestion failed, corticosteroid was injected in 4 quadrants at the site of the stricture in the same setting. After 2 weeks, another trial of endoscopic dilatation was done.
RESULTS: Out of the 340 patients with failed first trial of endoscopic dilatation followed by four-quadrant corticosteroid injection, the second trial of endoscopic dilatation, after 2 weeks, was possible in 255 patients (75%). In the remaining 85 patients (25%), the endoscope could not pass and they were candidate for esophageal replacement.
CONCLUSIONS: Four-quadrant corticosteroid injection of impassable caustic esophageal stricture followed by endoscopic dilatation is a minor procedure which decreased the need of a major procedure to replace the injured esophagus.
TYPE OF THE STUDY: Clinical research paper.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III.
