Title: Low Bone Mineral Density on Computed Tomography: Association with Poor Survival after Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: Background: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has evolved as first-line therapy for severe aortic valve stenosis (AS), with pre-procedural computed tomography (CT) providing critical anatomical information. While primarily used for anatomical planning, TAVR-CT also offers an opportunity to assess low bone mineral density (BMD), a known indicator of frailty. Despite this, the prognostic role of BMD in TAVR patients remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate BMD on routine TAVR-CT and its impact on long-term survival. Methods: In this retrospective study, 770 consecutive TAVR patients (mean age 80.7 ± 6.7 years, 54.0% males) between November 2015 and March 2022 were included. BMD was measured from a single axial image at the thoracic vertebral level on unenhanced CT scans. Cox regression models assessed the impact of BMD on mortality, and Restricted Cubic Spline models identified potential mortality thresholds. Results: The mean BMD value, as measured on non-contrast CT, was 147.5 ± 5.4 Hounsfield units, demonstrating a noteworthy association with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio per 100 HU decrease: 1.27 [95%CI: 1.01-1.59], p = 0.041). Restricted cubic spline analysis indicated that BMD below 200 HU was linked to a substantial increase in mortality risk. Upon crude Cox regression analysis, every 100 HU decrease was associated with a 32% increase in risk for death (HR 1.32 [95%CI: 1.068-1.65)], p = 0.010). Conclusions: In conclusion, low BMD on TAVR-CT is independently associated with reduced survival, suggesting its potential as a tool for comprehensive frailty assessment and improved risk prediction in TAVR patients.
