Title: Retinal artery occlusion does not portend an increased risk of stroke.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the subsequent risk of stroke after a diagnosis of retinal artery occlusion (RAO). We hypothesized that the risk would be low and comparable to that of the general population. RAO is relatively rare and often incorrectly diagnosed. We believe our institution is in a unique position to investigate this relationship with both a high-volume eye center and vascular laboratory.
METHODS: This was a retrospective, single-institution review of 221 patients diagnosed with RAO from 2004 to 2018, confirmed with fluorescein angiography. Demographics, comorbidities, imaging of the carotid arteries, and prospective events, such as stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and death, were recorded. Time to first stroke, first MI, and death was estimated using Kaplan-Meier estimation separately and as a composite end point.
RESULTS: There were 221 patients identified with a confirmed diagnosis of RAO. The mean age in the cohort was 66.1 years; 53% of patients were male, and 29% were diabetic. Median length of follow-up was 2.2 years. Five patients (2.3%) had a documented stroke; four of the five strokes occurred at the time of RAO, with one that was contralateral occurring at 1.2 years. There were eight MIs (3.6%) in the cohort, two of which resulted in death. Twenty-two patients (10%) experienced a stroke, MI, or death. There were 141 (63.8%) patients who had carotid imaging performed, of whom 20 (14.2%) were found to have >50% stenosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The rate of stroke in patients with confirmed RAO was 2.3%; however, excluding concurrent ischemic events, the risk was <1%. The incidence of carotid artery stenosis >50% was 14.2%. The authors conclude that the risk of stroke after confirmed RAO is lower than previously reported and comparable to prior population-based studies of all at-risk adults.
