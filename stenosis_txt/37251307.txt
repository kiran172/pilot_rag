Title: Recurrent labial adhesion and vaginal destruction treatment with ileal vaginoplasty and labia major flap: A rare case report.

Abstract: Labial adhesion (LA) and vaginal destruction are very rare conditions in women. We report a 40-year-old woman with severe LA and distal vaginal stenosis after a radical hysterectomy at the age of 35. Completely destruction of vaginal epithelium, severe recurrent LA, voiding symptoms, and chronic pelvic pain occurs for her due to the repeated vaginal dilatation and low estrogen level. A combination of ileal vaginoplasty (IV) and labia majora flap was used in two surgical stages for treatment. After surgery, the patient's urinary symptoms and pelvic pain were relieved and she was able to have sex with her partner.
