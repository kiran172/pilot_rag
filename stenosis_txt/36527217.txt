Title: Transforaminal Endoscopic Decompression for Foraminal Stenosis: Single-Arm Meta-Analysis and Systematic Review.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to conduct a single-arm meta-analysis and comprehensive systematic review to identify the efficacy and safety of transforaminal endoscopic surgery for the treatment of lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS).
METHODS: The meta-analysis was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses statement. The PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases were searched from inception to February 20, 2022. Primary research results were visual analog scale scores, Oswestry Disability Index scores, MacNab criterion scores, and reported adverse events. Subgroup analyses were performed on the primary outcome to evaluate the potential effects of several clinical factors that affected the results.
RESULTS: Of the 2020 studies identified, 9 met the inclusion criteria, and 316 participants were eligible for meta-analysis. The meta-analysis results found that transforaminal endoscopic surgery for the treatment of LFS was associated with a significant improvement in postoperative 12-month clinical indicators: 8 studies reported improvements in visual analog scale scores: -5.38, Oswestry Disability Index scores: -40.44, and MacNab criterion scores: odds ratio = 0.86; 8 studies reported 11.53% adverse events occurred in a total of 295 patients, and the most commonly reported event was transient postoperative dysesthesia, which occurred in 26 patients in a total of 6 studies with 240 patients (10.83%).
CONCLUSIONS: Transforaminal endoscopic surgery positively affects postoperative LFS patients' clinical indicators; however, high-level literature with randomized controlled trials is needed to confirm this technique's applicability in LFS.
