Title: Association of Acute Procedural Results With Long-Term Outcomes After CTO PCI.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the association of procedural outcomes with long-term mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) after chronic total occlusion (CTO) percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).
BACKGROUND: The association between acute procedural results and subsequent outcomes has received limited study.
METHODS: Between January 2010 and December 2013, a total of 2,659 CTO PCI patients were consecutively enrolled. Procedural results were categorized into 3 groups: 1) optimal recanalization, with reperfusion of the occluded vessel and side branches (if any) with TIMI (Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction) flow grade 3; 2) suboptimal recanalization, meeting any of the following criteria: persistence of significant side branch occlusion, final TIMI flow grade 1 or 2, or residual percentage diameter stenosis >30%; and 3) procedural failure (i.e., failure to cross a lesion with a balloon angioplasty catheter). The primary outcome was the 5-year composite endpoint of cardiac death and MI.
RESULTS: Overall, optimal recanalization was achieved in 1,562 patients (58.7%), suboptimal recanalization was achieved in 399 patients (15.0%), and recanalization failed in 698 patients (26.3%). The 5-year incidence of the primary outcome was significantly higher in the suboptimal recanalization group compared with the optimal recanalization and the failure groups (10.1% vs. 6.5% vs. 6.3%; p = 0.046), which was driven mainly by higher risk for MI. In subgroup analysis, significant side branch occlusion was associated with numerically higher risk for 5-year MI (hazard ratio: 1.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.99 to 2.43; p = 0.054).
CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of CTO PCI patients, suboptimal recanalization was associated with significantly higher long-term incidence of cardiac death and MI compared with optimal recanalization or procedural failure.
