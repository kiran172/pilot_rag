Title: Analysis of preoperative and postoperative blood gas indices and airflow dynamics with tracheal stenosis undergoing tracheal reconstruction.

Abstract: Prolonged ventilation remains the most common cause of tracheal stenosis. Tracheal reconstruction is the gold standard treatment in these cases. The success of surgery is based on results of the pulmonary function test (PFT) which relies on patients' performance and their cooperation. The objective of the study was to investigate the impact of tracheal reconstruction in cases of tracheal stenosis on blood gas indices as well as airflow indices and whether arterial blood gas (ABG) can be a better surrogate of adequacy of tracheal reconstruction. This was a retrospective observational study of 61 patients with tracheal stenosis between the ages of 21 and 65 years who underwent tracheal reconstruction. The preoperative and postoperative values of various blood gas indices like partial pressure of oxygen (pO<sub>2</sub>), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO<sub>2</sub>), and potential of hydrogen (pH) and airflow indices like forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were evaluated and found that all the parameters showed significant improvement after tracheal reconstruction with P &lt; 0.0001. Tracheal reconstruction resulted in improvement of oxygenation and airflow parameters which led to relief of symptoms. Hence, ABG can be used as a surrogate marker for denoting the success of the surgery.
