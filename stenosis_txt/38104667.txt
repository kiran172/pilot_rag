Title: Preoperative Predictors of Surgical Success for Robotic Ureteral Reconstruction of Proximal and Middle Ureteral Strictures.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate predictors of surgical success for patients undergoing robotic ureteral reconstruction (RUR) for ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO), proximal, and middle ureteral stricture disease.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed our multi-institutional Collaborative of Reconstructive Robotic Ureteral Surgery database to identify all consecutive patients undergoing RUR for UPJO, proximal and/or middle ureteral stricture disease between April 2012 and December 2020. The specific reconstruction technique was determined by the primary surgeon based on clinical history and intraoperative findings. Patients were grouped according to whether they were surgical successful. Preoperative variables between both groups were compared using chi-square tests. All independent variables with associations of P <.2 then underwent a binary logistic regression analysis to determine predictive variables of success for RUR (P ≤.05 was considered statistically significant).
RESULTS: Overall, 338 patients met inclusion criteria. Surgical success rates of RUR are shown in Table 1. Univariate analysis (Table 2) showed that there were a lower proportion of patients with diabetes (8.9% vs 25.7%, P <.01) and a higher proportion of patients who underwent ureteral rest (74.3% vs 48.6%, P <.01) in the surgical success group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis (Table 3) further revealed the odds of surgical success in patients without diabetes was 3.08 times ((confidence interval) CI 1.26-7.54, P = .01) the odds of success for patients with diabetes. The odds of surgical success in patients who underwent preoperative ureteral rest were 2.8 times (CI 1.35-5.83, P = .01) the odds of success for patients who did not undergo preoperative ureteral rest.
CONCLUSION: Surgical success of RUR for management of UPJO, proximal, and middle ureteral strictures may be influenced by factors including preoperative ureteral rest and presence of diabetes.
