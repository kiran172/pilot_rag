Title: Comparison of Long-Term Mortality in Patients With Single Coronary Narrowing and Diabetes Mellitus to That of Patients With Multivessel Coronary Narrowing Without Diabetes Mellitus.

Abstract: It is well recognized that patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and multivessel coronary artery disease (MVD) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) have poorer long-term outcomes compared with those undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. However, the relative impact of DM status and extent of coronary artery disease on long term mortality in patients undergoing PCI is unknown. We sought to compare patients with DM undergoing PCI for single and multivessel disease to their non-DM counterparts. Overall, 34,690 consecutive patients undergoing PCI from the Melbourne Interventional Group registry (2005 to 2017) were included (mean age 64.5 ± 12 years, 76.6% male). Our cohort was stratified by the presence of DM and extent of CAD (DM-SVD [single-vessel disease] [n = 2,669], DM-MVD [n = 6,118], no-DM-SVD [n = 10,993], no-DM-MVD [n = 14,910]). DM-SVD and no-DM-MVD cohorts demonstrated comparable baseline cardiovascular risk profiles, although the no-DM-MVD cohort had higher rates of prior myocardial infarction, while the DM-SVD cohort had a higher proportion of patients with renal impairment. Over a median follow-up of 4.8 (IQR 2.0 to 8.2) years, 6,031 (17.5%) patients died. Using the no-DM-SVD group as the reference category, adjusted risk of mortality was highest in the MVD-DM cohort (HR 1.90; 95% CI 1.71 to 2.09). Similar adjusted risk of long-term mortality was observed in the DM-SVD (HR 1.32, 95%CI 1.15 to 1.51) and no-DM-MVD (HR 1.30, 95%CI 1.20 to 1.40) groups. In conclusion, we found that the long-term mortality of patients with DM and SVD undergoing PCI was the risk equivalent of non-DM patients with MVD.
