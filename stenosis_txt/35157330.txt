Title: Transpelvic urethrostomy in a female dog with congenital vestibulovaginal and urethral stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To describe transpelvic urethrostomy (TPU) as a surgical technique for the successful treatment of vestibulovaginal and urethral stenosis in a 7 month old female spayed mixed-breed dog.
STUDY DESIGN: Case report.
SAMPLE POPULATION: Female spayed mixed-breed dog with obstructive vaginal tissue present on vaginal examination.
METHODS: The dog presented with a history of persistent urine dribbling, stranguria, and dysuria since birth. Vaginoscopy and fluoroscopy revealed severe vestibulovaginal and urethral stenosis. An episiotomy and partial vaginectomy were performed to remove stenotic tissue. A perineal urethrostomy was attempted from a blind-ended pouch associated with the stenotic urethral tissue but was unsuccessful. The dog was repositioned in dorsal recumbency and a postpubic urethrostomy was performed.
RESULTS: Six days postoperatively, incisional dehiscence occurred at the cranial aspect of the urethrostomy. The site was revised at this location using a TPU to decrease tension at the urethrostomy site. The dog recovered uneventfully with no further complications identified after surgery. Forty-two months after surgical intervention, the dog continued to show no clinical signs.
CONCLUSION: Transpelvic urethrostomy may be a viable surgical alternative for dogs diagnosed with urethral stenosis.
