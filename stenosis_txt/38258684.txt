Title: [Endoscopic vacuum therapy in minimally invasive treatment of esophageal perforations].

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To compare the results of endoscopic vacuum therapy (EVT) and open surgery for esophageal perforations.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 60 patients with esophageal perforations between 2010 and 2022. The main group included 29 patients who underwent minimally invasive treatment with EVT, the control group - 31 patients after open surgical interventions.
RESULTS: Pneumonia occurred in 21 (72%) and 14 (45%) patients (p=0.04), esophageal stenosis within the perforation zone - in 4 (13.8%) and 1 (3.2%) patient, respectively (p=0.188). Chronic esophageal fistulas were significantly more common in the control group (6 (20.7%) versus 15 (48.4%) patients, p=0.032). The overall duration of treatment (median) among survivors was significantly shorter in the main group: 33 (23; 48) versus 71.5 (59; 93.7) days (p=0.5). However, length of ICU-stay was slightly higher (11 (6; 16) versus 8.5 (5; 12.75) days, p=0.32). Mortality rate was 13.8% (n=4) and 29% (n=9), respectively (p=0.213). Minimally invasive technologies decreased the risk of fatal outcome by 10 times (OR 10.123, 95% CI 1.491-124.97, p=0.035) compared to traditional surgery.
CONCLUSION: EVT in complex minimally invasive treatment of patients with mechanical esophageal injuries is an effective method significantly reducing mortality and duration of inpatient treatment compared to traditional surgical approach.
