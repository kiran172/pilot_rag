Title: Nasal Airway Volumes are More Asymmetric in Skeletally Mature Patients With Cleft lip and Palate Than Controls on 3-Dimensional Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study assesses nasal airway volumes in skeletally mature patients with CLP and healthy controls and examines the relationship among nasal volumes, cleft laterality, and facial asymmetry.
METHODS: Computed tomography images from patients with CLP and controls were analyzed using Mimics Version 23.0 (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). Relationships among nasal airway volume, cleft laterality, and facial asymmetry were compared.
RESULTS: The 89 patients in this study included 66 (74%) CLP and 23 (17%) controls. Nasal airway volumes in CLP were more asymmetric than controls (26.8±17.5% vs. 17.2±14.4%; P=0.015). In UCLP, the smaller nasal airway was on the cleft side 81% of the time (P<0.001). Maximum airway stenosis was on the cleft side 79% of the time (P<0.001), and maximum stenosis was on the same side as the smaller airway 89% of the time (P<0.001). There was a mild linear relationship between nasal airway asymmetry and maximum stenosis (r=0.247, P=0.023). On 3-dimensional image reconstruction, the septum often bowed convexly into the cleft-sided nasal airway with a caudal deviation towards the noncleft side. Nasal airway asymmetry was not associated with facial midline asymmetry (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: The nasal airway is more asymmetric in patients with cleft lip and palate compared with the general population, with the area of maximum stenosis usually occurring on the cleft-sided airway. In patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate, the septum often bows into the cleft side, reducing the size of that nasal airway. Nasal airway asymmetry did not correlate with facial asymmetry.
