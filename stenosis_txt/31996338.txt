Title: Spinal Sparganosis Coexisting with Acquired Arteriovenous Fistula of the Filum Terminale.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Spinal sparganosis associated with filum terminale arteriovenous fistula (FTAVF) has not been reported in the literature. In previous studies, these 2 rare diseases were usually reported separately. We report the first case of spinal sparganosis with concomitant FTAVF.
CASE DESCRIPTION: Spinal sparganosis associated with FTAVF manifested in a middle-aged man with progressive back pain and paraparesis. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbosacral spine revealed large intradural mass-like lesions involving the conus medullaris and entire cauda equina. Additionally, there was degenerative spinal stenosis at the level of L2-3 to L5-S1. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine disclosed abnormal hypersignal intensity extending from the level of the conus medullaris to T7 with tortuous intradural flow voids along the ventral more than dorsal surfaces of the spinal cord. Magnetic resonance angiography and spinal angiography confirmed FTAVF at the level of L3-4. The patient underwent surgical removal of the granulation tissues with lysis adhesions and obliteration of the FTAVF simultaneously in the same surgical session. Histologic findings were consistent with sparganosis.
CONCLUSIONS: The formation of FTAVF in the present case may have resulted from severe spinal canal stenosis caused by lumbar spondylosis and spinal sparganosis, inducing chronic inflammation and severe adhesion of spinal nerve roots. This evidence indicates that FTAVF may have been acquired.
