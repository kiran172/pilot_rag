Title: Traumatic Vertebral Artery Stenosis Inflicted by Stray Arrow.

Abstract: A 17-year-old female presented to the emergency room with an arrow sticking out the right aspect of her neck. Her vital signs were stable with systolic blood pressure of 117 mmHg, without either tachycardia, dyspnea, or signs of active bleeding. She was fully conscious with intact sensory and motor function on all extremities. Computed Tomography (CT) showed that the tip of the arrowhead lodged at the transverse foramen of the third cervical vertebra. Digital subtraction angiography revealed that the arrowhead lies posterior to the right vertebral artery, narrowly missing it by about two millimeters. Emergency surgery was arranged in hybrid operating suite. An occlusion balloon catheter was introduced to right vertebral artery but not inflated prior to extracting the arrowhead. After extraction, oozing from the wound was noted. We then inflated the balloon while the neurosurgeon performed hemostasis with gauze compression and electrocoagulation probe. The right vertebral angiography after releasing of the balloon showed focal narrowing of the artery without contrast extravasation. The patient was discharged on the fifth hospital day, and no anticoagulant was prescribed due to lack of neurological deficit. Pre-surgical planning and partnership with the neurosurgeon lead to the optimal outcome for this case.
