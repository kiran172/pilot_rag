Title: Management of severe aortic stenosis in the presence of an 8 mm right coronary stent protrusion.

Abstract: Management of a protruding coronary stent into the aortic root in patients undergoing evaluation for transcatheter aortic valve replacement can be challenging. We describe a patient treated with stent trimming and surgical aortic valve replacement, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary evaluation and selection process in this complex scenario.
