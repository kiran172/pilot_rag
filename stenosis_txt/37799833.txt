Title: Endovascular repair of right-sided iliac vein aneurysm and iliac arteriovenous fistula.

Abstract: A 72-year-old man receiving anticoagulation therapy for chronic bilateral deep vein thromboses presented with acute right leg swelling. Right-sided imaging showed deep femoral vein thrombosis, chronic partial femoral vein thrombosis, and 4.8-cm distal external iliac vein dilation with possible right iliac vein stenosis. Venography confirmed common iliac vein occlusion and an aneurysm, with a fistula to the right internal iliac artery found by angiography. Aneurysm obliteration was achieved via arterial embolization with coils and an Amplatzer plug (Abbott, Chicago, IL). The patient continued with anticoagulation therapy, with patent common and external iliac arteries and a stable right external iliac vein aneurysm without arterial waveforms found on follow-up. His clinical manifestations were improved.
