Title: Prevalence of cervical anterior and posterior spondylolisthesis and its association with degenerative cervical myelopathy in a general population.

Abstract: The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of cervical spondylolisthesis according to age and vertebral level and its association with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM). This study included 959 participants (319 men and 640 women; mean age, 66.4 years) in the Wakayama Spine Study from 2008 to 2010. The outcome measures were cervical spinal canal (CSC) diameter at C5 level on plain radiographs, the degree of cervical spondylosis using the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade, cervical cord compression on sagittal T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, and physical signs related to DCM. The prevalence of cervical anterior and posterior spondylolisthesis was investigated in men and women by age. In addition, logistic regression analysis determined the association between CSC diameter, posterior spondylolisthesis, and clinical DCM after overall adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index. The prevalence of anterior spondylolisthesis was 6.0% in men and 6.3% in women, and that of posterior spondylolisthesis was 13.2% and 8.9%, respectively. In addition, posterior spondylolisthesis prevalence increased with age in both sexes. Logistic regression analysis revealed that developmental canal stenosis (≤13 mm) and cervical posterior spondylolisthesis are independent significant predictive factors for DCM. The prevalence of degenerative cervical posterior spondylolisthesis was increasing with age and more frequent in men than in women. Narrow canal and degenerative cervical posterior spondylolisthesis on X-ray may be useful in predicting or diagnosing DCM.
