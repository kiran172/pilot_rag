Title: Percutaneous Balloon Dilatation for Hepaticojejunostomy Stricture Following Paediatric Liver Transplantation: Long-Term Results of an Institutional "Three-Session" Protocol.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to report the long-term results of an institutional protocol of percutaneous biliary balloon dilatation (PBBD) on paediatric patients with benign anastomotic stricture after liver transplantation. As a secondary objective, we evaluated risk factors associated with post-treatment re-stricture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen paediatric, post-liver transplant patients with benign anastomotic stricture of Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy were included. All patients underwent the same treatment protocol of three PBBD procedures with 15-day intervals. Clinical outcome was analysed using the Terblanche classification. Primary patency rate was assessed with the Kaplan-Meier test.
RESULTS: All patients had an initial successful result (Terblanche grade, excellent/good) after PBBD. At the end of the follow-up time of 35.7 ± 21.1 months (CI95%, 23.5-47.9), 10 patients persisted with excellent/good grading, while the remaining 4 had re-stricture, all of the latter occurring within the first 19 months. Patency rate after percutaneous treatment at 1, 3, and 5 years were 85.7%, 70%, and 70%, respectively. History of major complication after liver transplantation was associated with 5 times higher risk of re-stricture, HR 5.48 [95% CI, 2.18-8.78], p = 0.018.
CONCLUSION: In paediatric patients with benign anastomotic stricture of hepaticojejunostomy after liver transplantation, the "Three-session" percutaneous biliary balloon dilatation protocol is associated with a high rate of long-term success. In this limited series, the history of post-liver transplant major complication, defined as complications requiring a reintervention under general anaesthesia or advanced life support, seems to be an independent risk factor for stricture recurrence.
