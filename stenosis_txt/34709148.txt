Title: Quadricuspid aortic valve and a large patent ductus arteriosus treated with device closure.

Abstract: Quadricuspid aortic valve is a remarkably rare congenital cardiac anomaly that predominantly becomes regurgitant with the passage of time. Aortic valve stenosis and aortic root dilatation are less common in quadricuspid aortic valve as compared to bicuspid aortic valve. The clinical presentation depends upon the functional status of the aortic valve, left ventricular function, and associated cardiac or coronary anomalies. The quadricuspid aortic valve is easily visualised during transthoracic echocardiogram with a characteristic X pattern of aortic valve in diastole. The association of quadricuspid aortic valve with patent ductus arteriosus is exceedingly rare. We are reporting a case of young girl with mildly regurgitant quadricuspid aortic valve, large patent ductus arteriosus, and volume-loaded left heart who underwent a successful device closure of her patent ductus arteriosus. To the best of our knowledge, such a case is being reported from Pakistan for the first time.
