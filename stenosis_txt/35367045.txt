Title: Concordance of Guideline-Based Risk Stratification and Selection of Patients for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation or Surgical Replacement.

Abstract: The 2020 American Health Association/American College of Cardiology valve guidelines recommend surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) for symptomatic patients with aortic stenosis (AS) age <65 years and transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for patients with AS age >80 years. We analyzed TAVI versus SAVR practice patterns using age-based recommendations. We compared 2016-to-2019 TAVI and isolated SAVR in northern New England at 5 centers according to guideline-recommended age groups. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify independent predictors of TAVI for the intermediate age group. The study was approved by each site's institutional review board in accordance with ongoing participation and quality improvement efforts in the Northern New England Cardiovascular Study Group. Among 4,161 patients with isolated severe AS, TAVI increased from 2016 to 2019: 55.8% versus 76.1%, p <0.01 for trend. SAVR for patients with AS age >80 years was uncommon and decreased over time: 13.1% versus 1.6%, p <0.01. TAVI utilization nearly doubled over time in young patients with AS age <65 years (14.3% vs 26.2%, p <0.01). Preference for SAVR decreased by 50% over time (p <0.01) in the intermediate age group (65 to 80 years). Independent predictors of TAVI among patients aged 65 to 80 years included older age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous stroke, and coronary artery bypass grafting, whereas vascular disease and clinical urgency favored SAVR. In conclusion, consistent with current American Health Association/American College of Cardiology guidelines, TAVI was the treatment of choice in >97% of severe patients with AS age >80 years by 2019. TAVI utilization in patients <65Â years has doubled over time and thus may not reflect current guideline recommendations. TAVI is the preferred choice in those aged 65 to 80 years, especially among patients with previous stroke or coronary artery bypass grafting.
