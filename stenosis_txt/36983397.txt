Title: One-Year Outcomes after Myval Implantation in Patients with Bicuspid Aortic Valve Stenosis-A Multicentre Real-World Experience.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) affects approximately 1.5% of the general population and is seen in nearly 50% of candidates for aortic valve replacement (AVR). Despite increasingly utilised transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) in aortic stenosis (AS) patients, its use among patients with severe bicuspid AS is limited as BAV is a heterogeneous disease associated with multiple and complex anatomical challenges.
AIM: To investigate the one-year outcomes of TAVI using the balloon-expandable Myval transcatheter heart valve (THV) (Meril Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., Vapi, India) in patients with severe bicuspid AS.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We collected data from consecutive patients with bicuspid AS who underwent TAVI with the Myval THV and had at least one-year follow-up. Baseline characteristics, procedural, and 30-day echocardiographic and clinical outcomes were collected. Sixty-two patients were included in the study. The median age was 72 [66.3, 77.0] years, 45 (72.6%) were males, and the mean STS PROM score was 3.2 Â± 2.2%. All TAVI procedures were performed via the transfemoral route. The median follow-up duration was 13.5 [12.2, 18.3] months; all-cause mortality was reported in 7 (11.3%) patients and cardiovascular hospitalisation in 6 (10.6%) patients. All-stroke was reported in 2 (3.2%), permanent pacemaker implantation 5 (8.3%), and myocardial infarction 1 (1.6%) patients. The echocardiographic assessment revealed a mean pressure gradient of 10 [8, 16.5] mmHg, effective orifice area 1.7 [1.4, 1.9] cm2, moderate AR in 1 (2%), mild AR in 14 (27%), and none/trace AR in 37 (71%). In total, 1 patient was diagnosed with valve thrombosis (2.1%), Stage II (moderate) haemodynamic deterioration was seen in 3 (6.4%), and stage III (severe) haemodynamic deterioration in 1 (2.1%) patient.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVI with the Myval THV in selected BAV anatomy is associated with favourable one-year hemodynamic and clinical outcomes.
