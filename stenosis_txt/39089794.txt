Title: The importance of MDCT in the evaluation of risk factors before the TAVI procedure and its complications after implantation.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) is the alternative to surgical valve replacement, expanding its indications in the latest guidelines. Multimodal CT (MDCT) is essential in patient selection and detection of complications. Vascular complications are frequent, so it is important to analyse the anatomy of the vessels before the procedure. Regarding annular ruptures and ventricular perforations, the volume and distribution of calcium and the ventricular diameter play an important role. Finally, valve migration is a rare complication that can occur both during and after TAVI. Proper planning of the MDCT procedure reduces the risk of complications and gives the interventional cardiologist security both before and during the procedure.
