Title: Sequential transcatheter aortic and pulmonic valve replacement in bioprosthetic valve dysfunction: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Transcatheter valve replacement is a less invasive alternative to surgical valve replacement and has become increasingly popular. It is often the preferred approach for patients with high surgical risk. In patients with multiple prior sternotomies and multi-valvular failure, sequential transcatheter valve replacements may be a viable option.
CASE SUMMARY: We present the case of a 61-year-old-man with two prior sternotomies who underwent sequential transcatheter replacements of the aortic and pulmonic valves for symptomatic aortic and pulmonary stenosis. He was deemed high risk for a repeat sternotomy. The decision to perform sequential transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and transcatheter pulmonic valve replacement (TPVR) a month apart was made. Patient underwent valve-in-valve TAVR in a stentless bioprosthetic valve with 29-mm Edwards Sapien 3 followed by TPVR with 26-mm Edwards Sapien 3. He tolerated both procedures well and was asymptomatic at 1-month follow up.
DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first reported successful case of sequential TAVR and TPVR with right ventricular outflow tract stenting in a patient with both aortic and pulmonic bioprosthetic valve dysfunction. Our case demonstrates that transcatheter approach to multi-valvular replacements may be a viable option for high-risk surgical patients.
