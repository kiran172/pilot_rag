Title: Multimodality Imaging in a Patient With Double Aortic Arch Undergoing Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation.

Abstract: Double aortic arch is a rare congenital malformation often identified as an incidental finding during routine imaging. In our case, we describe aortic hemodynamics of double aortic arch in a patient with severe aortic stenosis and the procedural process of transcatheter aortic valve implantation.
