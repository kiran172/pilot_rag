Title: [The role of triangular space of ear canal-parotid-mastoid in the surgery for first branchial cleft anomalies].

Abstract: Objective:To explore the role of triangular space of ear canal-parotid-mastoid in the operation of the first branchial cleft deformity. Methods:The clinical features and intraoperative characteristics of 25 cases with first branchial cleft anomalies who underwent surgery from September 2011 to September 2019 were analyzed, and the role of the triangular space of ear canal-parotid-mastoid in the surgery was explored. Results:Following dissecting and lesions removel of the triangular space of ear canal-parotid-mastoid, all the lesions were resected completely. Eighteen cases had fistula in the floor wall of ear canal, seven cases had duplicated of external auditory canal in the inferior of the floor wall. The recurrent cases were all attributable to the residual lesions in the triangular space. There was no recurrence, salivary leakage or stenosis of external canal. One case suffered from HB2 level facial paralysis. Conclusion:Surgery is the optimal treatment for first branchial cleft anomalies. Following the active dissection of the ear canal-parotid gland-mastoid space and depending on the microscopic operation, the deep lesions would be exposed clearly and the facial nerve could be marked and protected. Cleaning this triangle space can lead to completely lesion removal, avoid facial paralysis, salivation and recurrence.
