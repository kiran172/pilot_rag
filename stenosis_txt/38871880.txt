Title: Lumbar foraminal stenosis was associated with back pain and leg pain: epidemiological evidence from a population-based cohort.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: To determine the characteristics of lumbar foraminal stenosis (LFS) on magnetic resonance (MR) images and their association with back pain and radiating leg pain in a population-based sample of Chinese subjects.
METHODS: This study was an extension of the Hangzhou Lumbar Spine Study, a cross-sectional study focusing on back pain and lumbar spine MR imaging findings. Questionnaire data, including demographics, lifestyle, occupational exposures, back pain and radiating leg pain were included. On lumbar spine MR images, disc degeneration was assessed using Pfirrmann grade and Modic changes were evaluated. Using Lee's scale, the L3-S1 intervertebral foramina were evaluated, with grade 2-3 representing substantial LFS and grade 0-1 no LFS. Characteristics of LFS were noted, and associations of LFS with back pain and radiating leg pain were examined.
RESULTS: Among the 644 study subjects, 141 (21.9%) had at least one LFS, and its occurrence was associated with greater age (OR = 1.93 for each 10 years, p < 0.001). Substantial LFS was associated with the presence of back pain (OR = 1.92, p = 0.001) and the intensity of the worst back pain (Coef = 8.30, p < 0.001) over the past 12 months, and disabling back pain during their lifetime (OR = 2.25, p < 0.001). Substantial LFS was also associated with leg pain (OR = 14.27, p < 0.001), with a sensitivity of 75.7% for the presence of radiating leg pain and a specificity of 81.4%.
CONCLUSION: Substantial LFS on MR images was a common age-related degenerative phenotype in adults, and appears to be an independent risk factor for back pain and leg pain.
