Title: Peri-Procedural Management of Hemodynamic Instability in Patients Undergoing Carotid Revascularization.

Abstract: Acute perioperative changes in arterial pressure occur frequently, particularly in patients with cardiovascular disease or those receiving vasoactive medications, or in relation to certain cardiovascular surgical procedures. Hemodynamic Instability (HI) is common in patients undergoing carotid revascularization because of unique patho-physiological and surgical factors. The operation, by necessity, disrupts the afferent pathway of the baroreflex, which can lead to postendarterectomy HI. Poor arterial pressure control is associated with increased morbidity and mortality after carotid revascularization, but good control of arterial pressure is often difficult to achieve in practice. The incidence, implications, and etiology of HI associated with carotid surgery are reviewed, and some recommendations made for its management. Close monitoring and titration of therapy are probably the most important considerations rather than specific choice of agents.
