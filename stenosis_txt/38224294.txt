Title: Acute coronary occlusion and percutaneous coronary intervention after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Early coronary angiography (CAG) has been recommended in selected patients following out-of-hospital-cardiac-arrest (OHCA). We aimed to identify clinical features associated with acute coronary occlusion (ACO) and evaluate the associations between ACO, successful percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and outcomes in this population.
METHODS: We included comatose OHCA patients treated with targeted temperature management (TTM) between December 2005 and September 2016 who underwent early CAG within 24 hours. The co-primary outcomes were all-cause 30-day mortality and good neurological outcome (modified Rankin Score [mRS] ≤2) at hospital discharge.
RESULTS: Among 155 patients (93% shockable arrest rhythm, 55% with ST elevation), 133 (86%) had coronary artery stenosis ≥50% and 65 (42%) had ACO. ST elevation (sensitivity 74%, specificity 59%, OR 4.0, 95% CI 2.0-8.1) and elevated first troponin (sensitivity 88%, specificity 26%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-6.1) had limited sensitivity and specificity for ACO. Unadjusted 30-day mortality did not differ significantly by coronary disease severity or ACO. Successful PCI was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality (adjusted HR 0.5, 95% CI 0.2-0.9, P=.03), especially among patients with ACO (adjusted HR 0.4, 95% CI 0.1-0.9, P=0.03). After adjustment, ACO and PCI were not associated with the probability of good neurological outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: In this select cohort of resuscitated OHCA patients undergoing CAG, unstable coronary disease is highly prevalent and successful PCI was associated with a higher probability of 30-day survival, especially among those with ACO. Neither ACO nor successful PCI were independently associated with good neurological outcome.
