Title: [Increased neoplastic risks in ulcerative colitis associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis].

Abstract: Ulcerative ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease characterized by the presence of continuous, uniform, gapless lesions of healthy mucous membrane extending integrally from the anus over a variable portion of the colon. It is a multisystemic pathology for which we will describe one of its hepatic manifestations, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). We present here the story of a patient, a carrier of the Breast Cancer type 1 gene mutation (BRCA1), who initially presented with epigastric and peri-umbilical abdominal pain associated with several episodes of bloody diarrhea. The initial assessment made it possible to diagnose BRCA1 and the fortuitous discovery of biliary tract stenosis of an undetermined nature. Further investigations led to the conclusion that there was a strong presumption of UC associated with PSC or even cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). In the course of treatment, cancer of the gallbladder was also detected. This clinical case makes it possible to review, in the light of recent publications, the pathophysiological link existing between UC and PSC. This article also presents an in-depth analysis of this entity with malignant potential that can affect different sites of the digestive tract, and its own management, which is the subject of new recommendations.
