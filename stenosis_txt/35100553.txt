Title: Valve-in-Valve Implantation of Medtronic CoreValve Prosthesis in Patients With Failing Bioprosthetic Aortic Valves: Mid-term Outcomes From the Italian CoreValve Clinical Service Project.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the acute and two-year safety and efficacy of using the Corevalve, Evolut R, and Evolut PRO valves for treating failed surgical bioprosthesis from the Italian CoreValve Clinical Service Project.
BACKGROUND: Valve-in-valve (ViV) TAVR is an emerging treatment option for failed surgical bioprosthesis. Choice of transcatheter valve is an important determinant of procedural and clinical outcomes, however, longer-term data are lacking.
METHODS: The Clinical Service Project is a national clinical data repository evaluating the use of implantable devices across Italy. The present multi-center analysis includes consecutive patients who underwent ViV-TAVR with the Medtronic CoreValve series between October 2008 to June 2019. Evaluated endpoints included rates of overall mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accidents at 2-year follow-up. Procedural success, complications, and echocardiographic outcomes were reported according to VARC-2 criteria.
RESULTS: A total of 139 patients (mean age, 80 ± 7 years; 47.5% male; mean STS score, 10.0 ± 9.7%) underwent ViV-TAVR with CoreValve (28.5%), Evolut R (68.6%), and Evolut Pro (2.9%) valves. Device success was achieved in 68% and acute coronary obstruction requiring PCI was observed in 4 patients (2.9%). Moderate PVL was observed in 3.7% and 2.8% of patients at 30-day and 2-year follow-up and moderate structural valve degeneration seen only 5 patients (3.6%). All-cause and cardiovascular mortality were 3.6% and 2.9% at 30 days, respectively, and 20.6% and 10.2% at 2-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: This real-world nationwide analysis demonstrates the acute and longer-term safety and efficacy of using the self-expanding Medtronic THV for ViV-TAVR.
