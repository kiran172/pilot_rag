Title: Embolization of Aortopulmonary Collateral Artery Cooperate with Valved Conduit Attached to the Right Ventricular Outflow Tract for Patient After Tetralogy of Fallot Repair: A One-Stop Procedure.

Abstract: We describe a one-stop procedure for aortopulmonary collateral artery (APCA) and postoperative complications of Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Postoperative complications of TOF include right ventricular outflow tract stenosis, pulmonary valvular annular stenosis, pulmonary regurgitation, and aortopulmonary artery stenosis. The one-stop procedure was defined as after APCA embolization. The heart continued to function under cardiopulmonary bypass during median sternotomy to reconstruct the right ventricular outflow tract with a valved conduit and replace the aortopulmonary artery. A biological valved was sewed within the valved conduit in an artificial blood vessel in vitro and subsequently was used in the procedure and achieved significant results.
