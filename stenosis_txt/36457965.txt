Title: Prognostic value of a comprehensive geriatric assessment for predicting one-year mortality in presumably frail patients with symptomatic aortic stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Despite suffering a severe aortic stenosis, some patients are denied either surgical or transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) therapy because of a frail condition. We aimed to identify whether a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) might be useful to predict the prognosis of presumably frail patients with severe aortic stenosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between March 2011 and July 2016, 818 patients were consecutively and prospectively enrolled. 161 had a CGA and were considered for analysis. Considering combined CGA and heart team recommendations, 102 TAVI procedures were performed (TAVI group) and 59 patients constituted the no-TAVI group. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality at 1 year.
RESULTS: There was no difference between the TAVI and the no-TAVI groups considering morphometric data, cardiovascular risk factors or symptoms. The no-TAVI group had higher surgical risk (logistic EuroSCORE1 33.4 ±17.8 vs. 22.7 ±14.9; p &lt; 0.001) and more moderate renal insufficiency (82% vs. 57%; p = 0.001). One-year mortality was 16% in the TAVI group and 46% in the no-TAVI group (p &lt; 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that history of pulmonary edema, moderate renal failure, and not having a TAVI were associated with 1-year mortality. There was an interaction between the Five-Times-Sit-to-Stand-Test (FTSST) and the effect of TAVI on mortality (p = 0.049), as FTSST was the only predictor for 1-year mortality in the no-TAVI group (HR = 0.18, 95% CI: 0.04-0.76; p = 0.019).
CONCLUSIONS: One-year mortality was higher in geriatric-assessed frail patients who did not undergo TAVI. FTSST, which assesses patients' mobility, was the only prognostic marker for 1-year mortality, on top of the usual medical parameters.
