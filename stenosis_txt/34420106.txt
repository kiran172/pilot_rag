Title: External carotid artery to internal carotid artery transposition to augment flow for a superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass associated with severe external carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Donor vessel quality can impact the outcome of extracranial-intracranial (EC-IC) bypass. External carotid artery (ECA) disease may produce embolism into the anastomosis and cerebral territory and possibly reduce flow in the superficial temporal artery (STA). Previously reported remedies to ECA stenosis include ECA endarterectomy, stenting, and angioplasty. Clinical presentation A middle-aged patient with chronic left MCA occlusion, progressive ischemic symptoms on maximal medical therapy, and imaging confirmation of compromised hemodynamic reserve was evaluated for EC-IC bypass. Angiography demonstrated severe ECA origin stenosis. An ECA-ICA transposition was performed, primarily to eliminate the risk of emboli and secondarily to possibly improve the STA flow. The patient sustained an excellent radiological and clinical outcome, and the STA donor cut-flow was increased modestly by 22% (45 to 55Â mL/min).
CONCLUSION: This case is the first report of an ECA to internal carotid artery transposition as an option in the management of ECA stenosis in preparation for an STA-MCA bypass for the purpose of flow augmentation.
