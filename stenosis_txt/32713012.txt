Title: A pseudoaneurysm of the left atrium as a rare source of coronary artery embolization.

Abstract: A 67Â years old woman with history of surgical Mitral valve replacement underwent transoesophageal echocardiography for evaluation of mild dyspnoea. It revealed a large narrow-necked outpouching from medial portion of the inferior wall of the left atrium (LA) that was extended to the interatrial septum. A diagnosis of the LA pseudoaneurysm was made. It contained a fresh clot. Five days later, the patient presented with an acute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Coronary angiography revealed an occluded right coronary artery at its distal part by a large thrombus. Thromboaspiration was done and resulted in restoration of a Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Score (TIMI) flow 3 without underlying stenosis.
