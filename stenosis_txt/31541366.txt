Title: Aortic valve stenosis awareness in Austria-results of a nationwide survey in 1001 subjects.

Abstract: Despite the prognostic significance of severe aortic valve stenosis, knowledge is limited in the general population. To document the status quo for Austria, knowledge about valvular heart disease/aortic valve stenosis was documented in 1001 participants >60 years of age. 6.7% of respondents were knowledgeable of aortic valve stenosis, with 1.6% being concerned about the condition (24.1% cancer, 18.8% Alzheimer's disease, 15.1% stroke). 29.5% were familiar with valvular heart disease (76.7% heart attack, 36.9% stroke). Only 1/3 reported auscultation by their general practitioner (GP) at least every third visit. Typical symptoms of aortic valve stenosis were likely to be reported by 50%. After exposure to further information on aortic valve stenosis, only 20% reported to be more concerned and ready to obtain more disease-related information. Awareness of surgical and catheter-based treatment options was claimed by 77% of respondents. Awareness campaigns on valvular heart disease are warranted to improve patient care in Austria.
