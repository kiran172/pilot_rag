Title: Eosinophilic esophagitis.

Abstract: Eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) is an atopic disease in which eosinophils infiltrate the esophageal mucosa and may result in a variety of upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Chief among these are dysphagia, heartburn, and food bolus obstruction in adults whereas children often present with abdominal pain or vomiting. Eosinophilic esophagitis is a chronic condition that if not detected and left untreated could lead to the development of subepithelial fibrosis and esophageal stenosis. The diagnosis of EoE is confirmed in a patient presenting with characteristic EoE symptoms, classic signs on endoscopy, and biopsy results showing >15 eosinophils/hpf. A number of useful treatments against EoE are currently available with new therapeutics on the horizon. The former include PPIs, topical steroids, and elimination diet; the latter comprise novel biologics including the monoclonal antibody dupilumab. All these treatments can improve symptoms and reduce esophageal eosinophil count. This brief introductory review describes the detection, diagnosis, and management of EoE.
