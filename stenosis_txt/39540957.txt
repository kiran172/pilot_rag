Title: Ruminant stimulating device-associated esophageal obstruction in a Japanese black heifer with acquired esophageal diverticulum.

Abstract: Esophageal diseases include esophageal obstruction, esophagitis, esophageal stricture, and esophageal diverticulum. Imaging can facilitate the selection of appropriate treatment options and assist in differential diagnosis. Esophageal obstruction in cattle is generally caused by greedy nature of chewing and swallowing of food and foreign structures, including stones, potatoes, trichobezoar, carrots, foodstuffs (i.e., hay), and rice chaff. Esophageal obstruction in cattle can also be caused by artificial procedures, and early detection and treatment are important to avoid severe esophageal injury and its associated risks. Herein, an 11-month-old Japanese black heifer presented with swelling and induration of the neck and snowball crepitation in the subcutaneous area of the left shoulder. Radiography and endoscopy revealed a spring-like foreign body in the esophagus and a cervical esophageal obstruction. Esophageal surgery confirmed that the foreign body was a ruminal mechanical stimulating brush (RB). The case died on day 8 after the initial examination. Pathological necropsy revealed that the RB had entered the esophageal diverticulum and caused esophageal obstruction. This case provides a valuable reminder about the risk of esophageal disease with oral administration procedures.
