Title: [A Case of Change from Normal-flow High-pressure Gradient Severe Aortic Stenosis to Paradoxical Low-flow Low-pressure Gradient Severe Aortic Stenosis].

Abstract: We report a case of a 77-year-old male who had been diagnosed with normal-flow high-pressure gradient severe aortic stenosis (AS) two years previously. In accordance with his wishes, it was decided not to perform surgery. He visited our hospital with anorexia and weight loss and was diagnosed with gastric cancer. Echocardiography showed a change to paradoxical low-flow low-pressure gradient severe AS (PLFLPG AS). A decrease in stroke volume is typically associated with a smaller LV size, but the reason for a smaller LV size in PLFLPG AS remains unclear. In this case, the change to PLFLPG AS was thought to be due to a decrease in whole body oxygen consumption, and this may help to understand the pathology.
