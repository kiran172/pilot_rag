Title: Prevalence and severity of cognitive dysfunction in patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI): clinical and cognitive impact at 1 year.

Abstract: AIM: We estimated the proportion and severity of cognitive disorders in an unselected population of patients referred for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Second, we describe clinical and cognitive outcomes at 1 year.
METHODS: Eligible patients were aged ≥ 70 years, with symptomatic aortic stenosis and an indication for TAVI. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess cognitive dysfunction (CD), defined as no CD if score ≥ 26, mild CD if 18-25; moderate CD if 10-18, and severe CD if < 10. We assessed survival and in-hospital complications at 6 months and 1 year.
RESULTS: Between June 2019 and October 2020, 105 patients were included; 21 (20%) did not undergo TAVI, and thus, 84 were analyzed; median age 85 years, 53.6% females, median EuroScore 11.5%. Median MoCA score was 22 (19-25); CD was excluded in 18 (21%), mild in 50 (59.5%), moderate in 15 (19%) and severe in 1. Mean MoCA score at follow-up was 21.9(± 4.69) and did not differ significantly from baseline (21.79 (± 4.61), p = 0.73). There was no difference in success rate, in-hospital complications, or death across CD categories.
CONCLUSION: The clinical course of patients with mild or moderate CD is not different at 1 year after TAVI compared to those without cognitive dysfunction.
