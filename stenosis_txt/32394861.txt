Title: [Predicting the development of adverse events in patients with acute coronary syndrome including genetics in the long-term follow-up].

Abstract: Aim To study a relationship of several factors (clinical and genetical markers) with unfavorable outcomes in patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) in long-term follow-up.Material and methods This full-design, prospective study included 415 patients with NSTE-ACS. 266 patients were evaluated for the presence of multifocal atherosclerosis (MFA). Typing of polymorphic variants rs1041981 LTA, rs1800629 TNF, rs4986790, and rs498679 TLR4, and also rs3024491 and rs1800872 IL10 was performed. Follow-up period lasted for 67±4 months. By the end of this period, information about clinical outcomes for 396 patients became available.Results During the entire follow-up period, unfavorable outcomes were observed in 239 (57.5 %) patients with NSTE-ACS. The following clinical signs were associated with unfavorable outcomes: history of myocardial infarction, age &gt;56 years, left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) ≤50 % and GRACE score ≥100, significant stenosis of brachiocephalic arteries, MFA, carriage of genotype А / А rs1041981 LTA (OR, 6.1; р=0.02) and allele А (OR, 1.9; р=0.01). According to results of a multifactorial analysis, the most significant predictors included LV EF &lt;50 %, MFA, and carriage of genotype А / А rs1041981 LTA.Conclusion Stratification of patients with NSTE-ACS into groups of high or low risk for having an unfavorable outcome within the next 6 years is possible using the prognostic model developed and presented in this study. The model includes the following signs: LV EF &lt;50 %, MFA, and carriage of genotype А / А rs1041981 LTA.
