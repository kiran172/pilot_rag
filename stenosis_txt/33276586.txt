Title: The Anatomy of the Circle of Willis Is Not a Strong Enough Predictive Factor for the Prognosis of Cross-Clamping Intolerance during Carotid Endarterectomy.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is safe and effective in reducing the risk of stroke in symptomatic severe carotid artery stenosis. Having information about cross-clamping (CC) intolerance before surgery may reduce the complication rate. The purpose of this study was to assess the usefulness of magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance angiography perfusion (P-MR) in determining the risk of CC intolerance during CEA.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 40 patients after CEA with CC intolerance were included in Group I, and 15 with CC tolerance in Group II. All patients underwent MRA of the circle of Willis (CoW), P-MR with or without Acetazolamide; P(A)-MR in the postoperative period.
RESULTS: CoW was normal in the MRA in three cases (7.5%) in Group I, and in eight (53%) in Group II. We found P-MR abnormalities in all patients from Group I and in 40% from Group II. Using a calculated cut-off point of 0.322, the patients were classified as CC tolerant with 100% sensitivity or as CC intolerant with 95% specificity. After evaluating P-MR or MRA alone, the percentage of false negative results significantly increased.
CONCLUSION: The highest value in predicting cross-clamping intolerance is achieved by using analysis of P(A)-MR and MRA of the CoW in combination.
