Title: Combinatorial prophylactic effect of phlorotannins with photobiomodulation against tracheal stenosis.

Abstract: Several conventional treatments are used to manage tracheal stenosis after intubation and surgical procedures; however, patients are at risk of restenosis because of the absence of effective preventative therapy. In this study, we evaluate the biomodulatory effect of PT-combined blue light (BL) PBM in tracheostomal stenosis-induced animal models. The PT-combined BL group showed a significant decrease in the fibrotic protein synthesis by downregulating the release of stenosis-triggering fibrotic signals, without cytotoxicity or thermal damage. Moreover, the combined treatment ameliorated excessive granulation and collagen formation, and consequently preserved the opening of the tracheostoma ten days after fenestration. The current study demonstrated the biomodulatory effect of PT-combined BL on human tracheal fibroblasts and tracheal fenestration rodent models. Hence, PT-combined BL has the potential to be an effective preventative treatment for tracheal stenosis but also as an alternative option for fibrotic disorders.
