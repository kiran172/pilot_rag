Title: Validation of robotic-assisted ureteroplasty with buccal mucosa graft for stricture at the proximal and middle ureters: the first comparative study.

Abstract: Although ureteroplasty with buccal mucosa graft for long-segmental ureteral stenosis has been developed long ago, evidence was still restricted to case series in published literature. This study aims to validate ureteroplasty with buccal mucosa graft (BMG) in long-segment stricture at the proximal and middle ureters under designed comparative methods. From April 2015 to January 2019, we performed robotic-assisted ureteroplasty with BMG with a two-phase design and compared ureteroplasty and BMG (phase 2 surgery) with endoscopic stenting (phase 1 surgery). Paired data of effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), hydronephrosis grade, and physical and psychological domains of the World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF were compared. A total of 29 patients were enrolled, and only three (10%) patients had hydronephrosis resolution after treatment with endoscopic stenting (p = 0.250 to baseline). Compared to endoscopic ureteral stent, Hedges' g of ureteroplasty with BMG was 0.56 (95% CI 0.43-0.69), 0.63 (95% CI 0.46-0.80), 0.80 (95% CI 0.56-1.04), and 1.06 (95% CI 0.69-1.43) in EGFR, GFR, physical domain of WHOQOL-BREF, and psychological domain of WHOQOL-BREF, respectively (All significance; p < 0.001). After 12-month follow-ups, no recurrence of stricture was reported. In conclusion, Robotic-assisted ureteroplasty with BMG onlay is efficient in reconstruction of long-segment stricture of the proximal and middle ureters.
