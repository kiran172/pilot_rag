Title: Subaortic Stenosis With Elevated Aortic Gradients in a Pregnant Patient.

Abstract: Subaortic stenosis is an obstructive lesion that may be exacerbated by pregnancy. We describe the management of a 39-year-old woman presenting at 37 weeks of pregnancy with a murmur who is found to have a subaortic membrane with severely elevated left ventricular outflow gradients. (Level of Difficulty: Beginner.).
