Title: Deletion of PDK<sub>1</sub> Caused Cardiac Malmorphogenesis and Heart Defects Due to Profound Protein Phosphorylation Changes Mediated by SHP<sub>2</sub>.

Abstract: Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK<sub>1</sub>), a master kinase and involved in multiple signaling transduction, participates in regulating embryonic cardiac development and postnatal cardiac remodeling. Germline PDK<sub>1</sub> knockout mice displayed no heart development; in this article, we deleted PDK<sub>1</sub> in heart tissue with different cre to characterize the temporospatial features and find the relevance with congenital heart disease(CHD), furthermore to investigate the underlying mechanism. Knocking out PDK<sub>1</sub> with Nkx2.5-cre, the heart showed prominent pulmonic stenosis. Ablated PDK<sub>1</sub> with Mef2cSHF-cre, the second heart field (SHF) exhibited severe hypoplasia. And deleted PDK<sub>1</sub> with αMHC-cre, the mice displayed dilated heart disease, protein analysis indicated PI3K and ERK were activated; meanwhile, PDK<sub>1</sub>-AKT-GSK3, and S6K-S6 were disrupted; phosphorylation level of Akt<sub>473</sub>, S6k<sub>421/424</sub>, and Gsk3<sub>α21</sub> enhanced; however, Akt<sub>308</sub>, S6k<sub>389</sub>, and Gsk3<sub>β9</sub> decreased. In mechanism investigation, we found SHP<sub>2</sub> membrane localization and phosphorylation level of SHP2<sub>542</sub> elevated, which suggested SHP<sub>2</sub> likely mediated the disruption.
