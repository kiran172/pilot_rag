Title: Changing epidemiology of esophageal stent placement for dysphagia: a decade of trends and the impact of benign indications.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In addition to managing malignant obstruction, esophageal stents (ESs) have evolved to address various benign etiologies of dysphagia. We sought to evaluate national trends and changes in practice of ES placement for both benign and malignant etiologies in hospitalized patients with dysphagia.
METHODS: The National Inpatient Sample (2003-2013) was used to include all adult inpatients (≥18 years of age) with endoscopy-guided ES placement for a symptom of dysphagia. Multivariable analyses for indications that impact temporal trends (3 time periods: 2003-2005, 2006-2009, and 2010-2013) and for hospital outcomes were performed.
RESULTS: A total of 7198 ESs were deployed endoscopically in hospitalized patients with dysphagia. Compared with malignant etiologies, there was a significant increase in ES placement for benign conditions (2013 vs 2003: 32.7% vs 14.5%, respectively; P < .001). Multivariable analysis using 2003 to 2005 as a reference showed that patients with benign etiologies for dysphagia predominantly contributed to the increase of ES placement during the most recent time period (2010-2013: odds ratio, 2.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.40-3.13). Multivariable analysis of hospital outcomes revealed no differences in inpatient mortality, duration of hospital stay, and hospital costs between malignant and benign indications.
CONCLUSIONS: In the preceding decade, ES placement for hospitalized patients with dysphagia has increased, driven largely by an over 8-fold rise in stent placement for benign indications. These findings warrant continued efforts to improve stent technology to decrease the risk of migration and review practice guidelines involving ES placement for benign etiologies.
