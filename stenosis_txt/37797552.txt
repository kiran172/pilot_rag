Title: Clinical Utility and Prognostic Value of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography in Patients With Cancer.

Abstract: There is growing interest in the role of coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) in cardio-oncology. However, there is a paucity of real-world experience and outcome data for patients with cancer. This study sought to determine the clinical utility and prognostic value of coronary CTA in patients with cancer. In this prospective, single-center study, we recruited patients with cancer who underwent coronary CTA. Coronary artery disease (CAD) extent was classified as normal, nonobstructive (1% to 49% stenosis), and potentially obstructive (≥50% stenosis). Patients were followed up for a median of 9 months (interquartile range 3 to 30 months) for cancer-related deaths and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) defined as nonfatal myocardial infarction, urgent unplanned revascularization, or cardiovascular death. The mean age of patients (n = 113) was 61 ± 12 years, and 68 were female (60%). The most common underlying cancers were breast (29%) and lymphoma (13%). A total of 25 patients had potentially obstructive CAD, most commonly of the left anterior descending artery. After coronary CTA, 88% statin-naive patients with potentially obstructive CAD were initiated on statin therapy. A total of 28/32 patients who were taking fluoropyrimidine chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine) continued therapy, of whom none had MACEs. Overall, there were no episodes of MACEs in this cohort and 11% had cancer-related deaths. Coronary CTA has an important role in the clinical decision-making in patients with cancer to detect CAD, initiate primary preventative therapy, and guide coronary revascularization. No MACEs occurred. Using this coronary CTA-guided approach, preventative therapy was initiated, and most patients continued prognostically important cancer therapy.
