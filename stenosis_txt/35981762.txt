Title: Endarterectomy, Stenting, or Medical Treatment for Symptomatic Carotid Near-Occlusion: Results from CAOS, a Multicenter Registry Study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The treatment of symptomatic carotid near-occlusion is controversial. Our aim was to analyze the results of carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stent placement in patients with symptomatic carotid near-occlusion and to identify factors related to technical failure, periprocedural complications, and restenosis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a multicenter, prospective nonrandomized study. Patients with angiography-confirmed carotid near-occlusion were included. We assessed the revascularization rate and periprocedural stroke or death. Twenty-four-month clinical and carotid imaging follow-up was performed, and rates of carotid restenosis or occlusion, ipsilateral stroke, and mortality were analyzed. Carotid artery stent placement, carotid endarterectomy, and medical treatment were compared.
RESULTS: One hundred forty-one patients were included. Forty-four carotid artery stent placement and 23 carotid endarterectomy procedures were performed within 6 months after the event. Complete revascularization was achieved in 83.6%, 81.8% in the carotid artery stent placement group and 87% with carotid endarterectomy (P = .360). Periprocedural stroke or death occurred in 6% (carotid artery stent placement = 2.3%; carotid endarterectomy = 13%; P = .077) and was not related to revascularization failure. The carotid restenosis or occlusion rate was 8.3% (5% restenosis, 3.3% occlusion); with carotid artery stent placement it was 10.5%; and with carotid endarterectomy it was 4.5% (P = .419). The 24-month cumulative rate of ipsilateral stroke was 4.8% in the carotid artery stent placement group, 17.4% for carotid endarterectomy, and 13.1% for medical treatment (P = .223). Mortality was 12%, 4.5%, and 5.6%, respectively (P = .422). Revascularization failure and restenosis occurred more frequently in patients with full collapse compared with patients without full collapse (33.3% versus 5.6%, P = .009; 21.4% versus 2.9%, P = .032, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Carotid artery stent placement and carotid endarterectomy are associated with high rates of failure and periprocedural stroke. Carotid near-occlusion with full collapse appears to be associated with an increased risk of technical failure and restenosis. Carotid near-occlusion revascularization does not seem to reduce the risk of stroke at follow-up compared with medical treatment.
