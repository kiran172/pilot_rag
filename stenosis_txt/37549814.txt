Title: Trends and Outcomes of Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation in Aortic Insufficiency: A Nationwide Readmission Database Analysis.

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has increasingly been utilized in patients with aortic insufficiency (AI) with insufficient data on its safety. The Nationwide Readmissions Database (NRD) was queried to identify patients undergoing TAVI for AI. Net clinical events (composite of in-hospital mortality, stroke, major bleeding) and procedural complications were assessed using a propensity-score matched (PSM) analysis to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OR). A total of 185,703 (AI 3873, aortic stenosis [AS] 181,830) patients were included in the analysis. Due to a significant difference in the baseline characteristics, a matched sample of 7929 patients (AI 3873, AS 4056) was selected. At index admission, the adjusted odds of in-hospital NACE (aOR 2.0, 95% CI 1.59-2.51), mortality (aOR 3.06, 95% CI 2.38-5.47), major bleeding (aOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.13-2.06) and valvular complications (aOR 9.48, 95% CI 6.73-13.38) were significantly higher in patients undergoing TAVI for AI compared with those undergoing TAVI for AS. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of NACE, mortality, stroke, major bleeding, and need for permanent pacemaker implantation at 30- and 180-days follow-up. TAVI in AI was associated with a higher risk of periprocedural NACE, mortality, and major bleeding. The risk of these complications attenuated at 30- and 180-day readmission.
