Title: Utility of Follow-Up Echocardiograms in Uncomplicated PDA Device Closures Performed After Infancy.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Guidelines recommend lifelong follow-up with transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) for patients who had a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) device closure via catheterization. The goal of this study was to determine the utility of follow-up TTE in patients who underwent an uncomplicated PDA device closure after infancy.
METHODS: Chart review was performed on patients who had a PDA closure ≥ 1 year of age between 1/1/2002 and 6/1/2020. Patients were excluded if they had other congenital heart disease, did not have a follow-up TTE ≥ 6 months after procedure, had a residual PDA or velocity > 2.0 m/s in the left pulmonary artery (LPA) or descending aorta (DAo) on the first TTE ≥ 6 months after device placement. Time points included the initial TTE after the procedure, first TTE ≥ 6 months after procedure, and the most recent TTE.
RESULTS: A total of 189 patients met the study criteria. The median age and weight at initial procedure were 2.7 (1.0-64.7) years and 12.5 (3.4-69.2) kg. Most recent TTE was performed 2.0 (0.4-17.0) years after PDA closure. There were no significant differences in fractional shortening (36.4 ± 5.0% vs. 36.9 ± 5.6%) or LPA velocity (1.1 ± 0.4 m/s vs. 1.1 ± 0.4 m/s) from initial to most recent TTE, respectively. Left ventricular internal diastolic diameter Z-score significantly decreased (1.4 ± 1.8 vs. - 0.01 ± 1.2, p < 0.01) and DAo peak velocity significantly increased (1.2 ± 0.3 m/s vs. 1.3 ± 0.3 m/s, p = 0.02) from initial to most recent TTE, respectively. No patient died or underwent an intervention on the LPA or DAo for stenosis. Seventy-five patients had a total of 208 repeat TTE > 1 year after PDA procedure with no change in clinical management.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients who underwent an uncomplicated PDA closure after infancy, TTE parameters improved or stayed within normal limits on the most recent TTE. Repeat lifetime TTEs after 1-year post-device placement in this population may not necessarily be needed if there are no clinical concerns.
