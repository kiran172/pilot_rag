Title: Changing from preserved, to preservative-free cyclosporine 0.1% enhanced triple glaucoma therapy: impact on ocular surface disease-a randomized controlled trial.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Halting and reversing glaucoma therapy-related ocular surface disease (GTR-OSD) will improve the success of long-term medical therapy, impacting millions of patients worldwide.
METHODS: A single-centre, masked, prospective, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 41 well-controlled open-angle glaucoma subjects with moderate to severe GTR-OSD on preserved latanoprost and dorzolamide/timolol fixed combination (DTFC) therapy was conducted. Subjects were randomized to preservative-free (PF) tafluprost and DTFC with either placebo or cyclosporine 0.1% drops for 6 months and were then crossed over to the opposite therapy. Oxford score of ocular staining was the primary outcome; osmolarity, matrix-metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) testing, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), punctum evaluation, adverse events and diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP) comprised secondary outcomes.
RESULTS: GTR-OSD findings improved with PF therapy. At 6 months the triple PF with placebo group showed improvement compared to baseline in mean Oxford score (mean difference [MD]:-3.76; 95% confidence interval [CI]:-4.74 to -2.77; p < 0.001), osmolarity (MD:-21.93; 95%CI:-27.61 to -16.24 mOsm/l; p < 0.001), punctum stenosis (p = 0.008) and conjunctival hyperaemia (p < 0.001). Similar improvements occurred in the cyclosporine enhanced period, which also provided greater improvement in MMP-9 positivity (24 vs 66%; p < 0.001) and TFBUT (p = 0.022). The cyclosporine group was superior vs placebo in mean Oxford score (MD:-0.78; 95%CI:-1.40 to -0.15); p < 0.001), itchiness and objective adverse events (p = 0.034). Cyclosporine elicited more stinging vs placebo (63 vs 24%; p < 0.001). Both PF regimens reduced mean diurnal IOP more than preserved therapy (14.7 vs 15.9 mmHg; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Changing from preserved to PF glaucoma medications improves ocular surface health and IOP control. Topical cyclosporine 0.1% further reverses GTR-OSD.
