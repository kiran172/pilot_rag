Title: Transcatheter Valve-in-Mitral Homograft in Tricuspid Position: First-in-Human Report.

Abstract: A young woman with concomitant symptomatic severe stenosis and regurgitation was managed by percutaneous valve implantation because of a failing mitral homograft in the tricuspid position. The implant procedure was performed using an Edwards S3 23-mm valve. Good hemodynamic results were achieved, and, at intermediate follow-up, she did not require hospitalization and was free of symptoms.
