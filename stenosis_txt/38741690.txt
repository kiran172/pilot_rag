Title: Atresia of the Aqueduct of Sylvius as a cause of congenital hydrocephalus.

Abstract: Hydrocephalus is defined as an anomaly in the flow of cerebrospinal fluid, with multiple and varied etiologies, both acquired and congenital. The most dominant etiology in the congenital aspect is the stenosis or atresia of the Sylvian Aqueduct, whether isolated or associated with other malformations. We report a case of congenital hydrocephalus due to a stenosis of the Aqueduct of Sylvius in a 2 and a half-year-old child, which was unrecognized in the neonatal period, and the importance of imaging, especially MRI, in the rapid diagnosis of this pathology.
