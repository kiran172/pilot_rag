Title: Association Between the Serum Uric Acid Level and the Severity of Coronary Artery Disease in a Retrospective Study of China Nondialysis CKD Patients.

Abstract: Introduction: Hyperuricemia has been associated with increased cardiovascular events in the general population. However, the role of serum uric acid (SUA) level on the severity of coronary artery stenosis (CAS) in nondialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients is obscure. Methods: We implement a retrospective cohort study of 734 patients diagnosed with stage 3-5 CKD. All selected patients underwent coronary artery angiography. The associations of SUA with the present, and severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) were analyzed. Results: Of these 734 patients, 511 patients had angiographically proven CAD. Compared with non-CAD group, the SUA level in CAD group was much higher (388.00 vs. 363.00 μmol/l, P &lt; 0.01). After adjusting for multiple confounding factors, a multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that SUA was relevant to the presence of CAD when SUA as a continuous variable. However, this relationship was not observed with SUA as a categorical variable. In a subgroup analysis for the CAD group, we found that the rates of severe CAS in the third tertile of SUA (58.6%) was higher than that in the first tertile (41.6%) (P &lt; 0.01). Compared with the first tertile of SUA, the third tertile of SUA was an independent risk factor for severe arterial stenosis (odds ratio, OR, 1.976 [1.203-3.248]), a pattern that was recapitulated by multivariate logistic regression analysis with SUA as a continuous variable (1.002 [1.000-1.004]). Conclusions: The SUA level may serve as a predictor of the severity of CAS among nondialysis CKD patients with CAD.
