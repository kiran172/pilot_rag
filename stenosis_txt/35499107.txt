Title: Anemia as a risk factor for restenosis in femoropopliteal arterial disease after drug-coated balloon angioplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the relationship between anemia and restenosis in patients with femoropopliteal arterial disease following drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty.
METHODS: 194 patients treated with DCB for femoropopliteal lesions were retrospectively analyzed for up to 12 months of follow-up between January 2017 and September 2020. Baseline clinical and procedural characteristics were compared between the anemia and non-anemia patients, and predictors of restenosis were identified using logistic regression.
RESULTS: 32.5% of the patients undergoing DCB angioplasty had anemia. Patients with anemia were significantly older, with higher rates of hypertension, coronary artery disease, chronic renal insufficiency, and diabetes, and with lower rates of smoking and male gender. In the multivariate analysis, anemia was independently and significantly associated with a higher risk of restenosis (OR, 3.872; 95% CI, 1.556-9.638; P = 0.004).
CONCLUSION: Anemia is independently associated with restenosis in patients treated with DCB for femoropopliteal arterial disease. Patients with lower baseline hemoglobin might have more chances to develop restenosis at follow-up.
