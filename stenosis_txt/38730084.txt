Title: Coronary sodium [18F]fluoride activity predicts outcomes post-CABG: a comparative evaluation with conventional metrics.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The value of preoperative multidisciplinary approach remains inadequately delineated in forecasting postoperative outcomes of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Herein, we aimed to ascertain the efficacy of multi-modality cardiac imaging in predicting post-CABG cardiovascular outcomes.
METHODS: Patients with triple coronary artery disease underwent cardiac sodium [18F]fluoride ([18F]NaF) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), coronary angiography, and CT-based coronary artery calcium scoring before CABG. The maximum coronary [18F]NaF activity (target-to-blood ratio [TBR]<sub>max</sub>) and the global coronary [18F]NaF activity (TBR<sub>global</sub>) was determined. The primary endpoint was perioperative myocardial infarction (PMI) within 7-day post-CABG. Secondary endpoint included major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) and recurrent angina.
RESULTS: This prospective observational study examined 101 patients for a median of 40 months (interquartile range: 19-47 months). Both TBR<sub>max</sub> (odds ratio [OR] = 1.445; p = 0.011) and TBR<sub>global</sub> (OR = 1.797; P = 0.018) were significant predictors of PMI. TBR<sub>max</sub>&gt;3.0 (area under the curve [AUC], 0.65; sensitivity, 75.0%; specificity, 56.8%; p = 0.036) increased PMI risk by 3.661-fold, independent of external confounders. Kaplan-Meier test revealed a decrease in MACCE survival rate concomitant with an escalating TBR<sub>max</sub>. TBR<sub>max</sub>&gt;3.6 (AUC, 0.70; sensitivity, 76.9%; specificity, 73.9%; p = 0.017) increased MACCEs risk by 5.520-fold. Both TBR<sub>max</sub> (hazard ratio [HR], 1.298; p = 0.004) and TBR<sub>global</sub> (HR = 1.335; p = 0.011) were significantly correlated with recurrent angina. No significant associations were found between CAC and SYNTAX scores and between PMI occurrence and long-term MACCEs.
CONCLUSION: Quantification of coronary microcalcification activity via [18F]NaF PET displayed a strong ability to predict early and long-term post-CABG cardiovascular outcomes, thereby outperforming conventional metrics of coronary macrocalcification burden and stenosis severity.
