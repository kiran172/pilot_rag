Title: Outcomes of revascularization of stenotic inframalleolar lesions in chronic limb-threatening ischemia.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: For chronic limb-threatening ischemia, revascularization has been reported for occlusions but not for stenosis in the inframalleolar (IM) lesions. We investigated the clinical outcomes of balloon dilation for stenotic IM lesions distal to the treatment target in the infrapopliteal (IP) legion.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who had chronic limb-threatening ischemia and underwent revascularization of stenotic IM lesions distal to the target IP lesions between January 2015 and August 2022. The outcome measures were amputation-free survival, wound healing rate, and freedom from target IM reintervention.
RESULTS: The 87 patients had a mean age of 72.7 ± 10.7 years and comprised 67.8% men, 74.7% with diabetes mellitus, 55.2% on dialysis, 33.3% who had Rutherford six classification. The amputation-free survival (AFS), wound healing, and freedom from target IM reintervention rates at 1 year were 82.9%, 53.3%, and 58.4%, respectively. On Cox proportional multivariate analysis, the predictors were Wound, Ischemia, and foot Infection (WIfI) ≥3 and diffuse stenosis in the target IM vessels for delayed wound healing and Global Limb Anatomic Staging System stage Ⅲ and ≥3 diseased IM vessels before endovascular therapy for target IM reintervention. At the time of reintervention, the lesion morphology had progressed from stenosis to occlusion in 50% of cases.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with chronic limb-threatening ischemia, revascularization of stenosis in IM lesions showed a high reintervention rate and progression of lesion morphology, although AFS and wound-healing rates were acceptable.
