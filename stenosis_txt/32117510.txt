Title: Laparoscopic Soave procedure for long-segment Hirschsprung's disease - single-center experience.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Hirschsprung's disease (HD) is one of the most common and severe diseases treated in pediatric surgery. Since the introduction of the laparoscopic technique into pediatric surgery, laparoscopic-assisted radical surgery for HD has demonstrated unique advantages. Long-segment and total-colon HD are the best indications for laparoscopic-assisted surgery.
AIM: To summarize clinical experience of the laparoscopic Soave procedure for long-segment HD in a single center.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data of children with long-segment HD who underwent the laparoscopic Soave procedure in our department from January 2013 to May 2018 were reviewed. The clinical features, surgical procedures and follow-up results were summarized and analyzed.
RESULTS: Thirty-one children underwent the laparoscopic Soave procedure; none of them were converted to open surgery. The average hospitalization time was 8.7 days after the operation, and no immediate postoperative complications occurred. There was no recurrence of constipation. Six (19.3%) cases were complicated with HD associated enterocolitis in the first 3 months postoperatively; 5 (16.1%) cases had soiling in the first year. There were 0 cases of adhesive bowel obstruction, 0 cases of anastomotic stenosis, and 0 cases of constipation.
CONCLUSIONS: A small volume centre may achieve satisfactory results for long-segment HD. The laparoscopic Soave procedure is a minimally invasive, safe and effective treatment.
