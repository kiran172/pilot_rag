Title: Clinical and Experimental Study of High Mobility Group Box-2 and Valvular Calcification in Elderly Patients with Degenerative Heart Valve Disease.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the high mobility group box-2 (HMGB2) and valve calcification in senile degenerative heart valve disease (SDHVD).
METHODS: According to the echocardiographic results, patients with calcified heart valves were used as the experimental group and patients without calcified heart valves were used as the control group; blood was drawn for testing, and serum levels of HMGB2 were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Human heart valve interstitial cells (hVICs) cultured in vitro were randomly divided into two groups. The calcification group was cultured with a medium containing calcification induction solution and cells were induced on days 1, 3, and 5, and the control group was cultured with a standard medium. Expression of bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4) and HMGB2 in both groups was detected by Western blot. RT-PCR was performed to detect the expression of the HMGB2 gene during calcification. The hVICs were cultured in vitro for 4 days with different concentrations of exogenous HMGB2 (0.01 μg/mL, 0.1 μg/mL, 1 μg/mL, 2 μg/mL), while the control group was cultured with a standard medium and the expression of BMP-4 and NF-κB P65 was detected by Western blot.
RESULTS: The serum level of HMGB2 was 7.90 (5.92, 12.39) μg/L, higher than that of 7.06 (5.06, 9.73) μg/L in the valve calcification group in elderly patients with degenerative valve disease (p = 0.005); the differences were statistically significant. In in vitro experiments, the cellular calcification protein BMP-4 and the HMGB2 protein were higher in the calcification group compared to the control group (p &lt; 0.05). Exogenous stimulation of hVICs with HMGB2 was able to upregulate the expression of BMP-4 and NF-κB P65 (p &lt; 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: HMGB2 is correlated with valvular calcification in senile degenerative heart valve disease. The HMGB2 protein may promote the process of SDHVD valve calcification by activating the NF-κB pathway and upregulating the expression of BMP-4.
