Title: Hazy lesion in a ventricular tachycardia patient: stents or drugs?

Abstract: Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is superior to coronary angiographyin guiding and optimizing complicated PCI. Here we report a successful treatment of a patient with ventricular tachycardia induced by treadmill test. Coronary angiography showed a hazy lesion in left anterior descending artery. IVUS revealed a 73% segment stenosis in the proximal segment of the LAD. Finally, a 3.5*21â€‰mm drug eluting stent was implanted in the LAD and an excellent final angiographic result was achieved.
