Title: The Curious Case of Pseudo-Wellens' Syndrome and Myocardial Bridging.

Abstract: Wellens' syndrome is an electrocardiographic harbinger of a critical left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery stenosis in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), whereas pseudo-Wellens' syndrome typically has angiographically normal coronary arteries. Myocardial bridging (MB) occurs when an epicardial coronary artery segment takes a tunneled intramuscular course. We describe a rare case of MB-induced pseudo-Wellens' syndrome in a young patient presenting with unstable angina (USA).
