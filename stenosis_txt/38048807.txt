Title: Alteration of circulating miRNAs during myocardial infarction and association with lipid levels.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Increasing mortality and morbidity of coronary artery disease (CAD) highlight the emerging need for novel noninvasive markers such as circulating microRNAs (miRNAs).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the circulating levels of miR-126-3p, miR-210-3p, let-7g-5p, and miR-326, and their associations with known contributors to CAD, in CAD subgroups.
METHODS: We divided the cohort into 4 groups: non-CAD controls (â‰¤30% stenosis; n = 55), and patients with stable angina pectoris (SAP; n = 48), unstable AP (UAP; n = 46), and myocardial infarction (MI; n = 36). The circulating levels of miR-126-3p, miR-210-3p, let-7g-5p, and miR-326 were determined using TaqMan Advanced miRNA Assays in serum specimens.
RESULTS: Circulating miR-126-3p levels were lower in the MI and UAP groups, compared with the non-CAD group, whereas miR-210-3p circulating levels were lower in the MI group than others. The levels of circulating let-7g-5p were shown to be useful for distinguishing UAP from MI, and there were substantial differences in circulating let-7g-5p levels between the UAP and MI groups. Moreover, lipid levels and ratios were lower in individuals with high circulating miR-126-3p and miR-210-3p levels.
CONCLUSIONS: The study results suggest that circulating miR-126-3p, miR-210-3p, and let-7g-5p are differentiated between different clinical presentations of CAD and associated with lipid levels, which are important risk factors and determinants of CAD.
