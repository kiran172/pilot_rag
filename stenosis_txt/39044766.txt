Title: Is a Carotid Doppler Scan Useful for Managing Patients with Suspected Ocular Ischemic Syndrome?

Abstract: PURPOSE: This review aims to understand the value of a carotid Doppler scan (CDS) when managing patients with clinical/suspected ocular ischaemic syndrome (OIS); correlations between internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis reports; subsequent patterns of referral to vascular experts; and subsequent decisions concerning surgical versus medical management.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 402 CDS requests by a single eye center over 4 years (2016-2019) for patients with a clinical suspicion of OIS was conducted. Data analysis included 344 patients who had reported CDS of both ICAs. We also studied referral patterns by ophthalmologists to other specialties.
RESULTS: CDS requests were related to the retina (53.2%), neuro/TIA problems (31.1%), glaucoma (10.5%) and other issues (5.2%). The majority of patients (209/344, 60.8%) had normal CDA results. Of the 688 ICAs reported, 469 (68.2%) were normal, 219 (31.8%) had atheroma present, and only 83 (12.1%) had significant stenosis. Of 83 ICAs with stenosis, 23 (27.7%) had â‰¥70% stenosis, 24 (28.9%) had 50-69% stenosis, and 25 (30.1%) had <50% stenosis. A total of 60/344 (17.4%) patients were referred to vascular/stroke teams: 15/60 (25%) referred had bilateral disease, and only 2/60 (3.3%) were offered carotid endarterectomy. All referred patients commenced statins and low-dose aspirin.
CONCLUSION: Our cohort showed a low incidence of ICA stenosis according to CDS reports in patients with suspected OIS. There were very low rates of vascular and endarterectomy referral. Commencement of conservative treatment (mini aspirin+statin) by ophthalmologists could be beneficial even in the early stage of presenting clinical evidence of OIS.
