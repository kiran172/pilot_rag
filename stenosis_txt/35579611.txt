Title: A systematic review of micro-RNAs in aortic stenosis and cardiac fibrosis.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the commonest valve lesion requiring surgery in the Western world. The presence of myocardial fibrosis is associated with mortality even after valve replacement. MicroRNAs could serve as biomarkers of fibrosis and risk stratify patients for earlier intervention. This study aimed to systematically review reports of micro-RNA (miR) associated with fibrosis in AS and identify potential biomarkers. We searched EMBASE, Medline, and Web of Science up to May 2020. Studies that reported on the role of miRs in AS and cardiac fibrosis were included. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Of 4230 reports screened, 25 were included. All studies were of low to moderate quality. MiRs were analyzed in myocardial tissue (n = 10), aortic valve tissue (n = 5), plasma (n = 5), and serum (n = 5). A total of 365 miRs were reported, of which only a few were reported in more than one paper (3 in the myocardium, 5 in the aortic valve, and 1 in plasma). miR-21 was upregulated in plasma and myocardial tissue. MiR-19b was downregulated in the myocardium. Papers reporting myocardial miR-1 contradicted each other, and miR-133a was associated with increased left ventricular mass regression post-surgery. In the aortic valve, miRs-665, 602 and 939 were downregulated, and miRs-193b and 214 were upregulated. The data on miR in fibrosis in AS is scarce and of low to moderate quality. Further studies are needed to identify novel miRs as biomarkers, especially at an earlier asymptomatic phase of the disease.
