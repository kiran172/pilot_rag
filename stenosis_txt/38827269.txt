Title: Cardiac Myosin Inhibition for Treatment of LVOT Obstruction in a Patient With Severe AS.

Abstract: Aortic stenosis and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are common conditions. When both are present in the same patient, the management can be challenging. We report what we believe to be the first time a cardiac myosin inhibitor has been used before transcutaneous aortic valve replacement.
