Title: [Coronary CT angiography derived fractional flow reserve: view from radiologist].

Abstract: The diagnosis of coronary artery disease depends on a comprehensive assessment including morphological and functional information. Coronary CT angiography derived fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) could obtain morphological and functional information from a single coronary CT angiography (CCTA) scan, achieving a "one-stop" assessment of coronary artery disease. CT-FFR is a non-invasive imaging examination to assess the hemodynamic changes of focal coronary lesions and suitable for patients with moderate to severe coronary artery stenosis or mild coronary artery stenosis combined with other high-risk characteristics, to assist in determining whether the lesions cause myocardial ischemia, and to guide clinical decisions and predict the risk of cardiovascular events. The application of CT-FFR relies on satisfied image quality of CCTA, and requires the cooperation of radiologists, clinicians and patients. This paper describes from the aspects of the measurement and analysis of CT-FFR, the diagnostic value of CT-FFR, the value of CT-FFR in assisting clinical decision making and prognosis, the comparison of CT-FFR with other functional cardiovascular imaging techniques and the future perspectives.
