Title: Retinal vessel diameters and microvascular abnormalities in patients with carotid stenosis before and 6 months after carotid endarterectomy: A prospective study.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To assess retinal findings in patients with severe carotid stenosis (CS) before and after carotid endarterectomy (CEA) compared to those in controls.
METHODS: This study is based on 70 patients (male 81%, mean age 69) scheduled for CEA in Helsinki University Hospital and 41 healthy nonmedicated controls (male 76%, mean age 68). Our examinations included fundus photographs. Semi-automated software (Vesselmap, Imedos) served for evaluation of central retinal arterial equivalent (CRAE) and venular equivalent (CRVE), and arterio-venous ratio (AVR) in both eyes. We assessed fundus photographs to subjectively grade microvascular abnormalities in the ipsilateral eyes including focal arteriolar narrowing and irregularities, arteriolar wall reflex, arterio-venous crossing signs and arteriolar and venular tortuosity in the macula.
RESULTS: CRAE was similar in the ipsi-and contralateral eyes of our patients, and similar to that of the controls both pre- and postoperatively. Preoperatively, we observed higher CRVE in the patients' ipsilateral than in their contralateral eyes (222 vs. 217 μm, p = 0.009), and likewise higher than in controls' eyes (222 vs. 214 μm, p = 0.024). CRVE decreased postoperatively in the patients' ipsilateral eyes (222 vs. 217 μm, p = 0.037). Among the microvascular abnormalities, arteriolar and venular tortuosity in the macula showed higher grades in the patients than in the controls preoperatively (p = 0.035 and p = 0.043), but not postoperatively (p = 0.15 and p = 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: CRVE decreased after CEA, showing that venules constrict after the mechanical hindrance of blood flow is removed. Higher grades in arteriolar and venular tortuosity in the macula, a potential ocular biomarker of CS, subsided after CEA.
