Title: Simultaneous bilateral angioplasty and stenting for carotid stenosis - a single center experience.

Abstract: Carotid artery stenosis is responsible for up to 12% of all ischemic strokes. The prevalence of bilateral carotid artery stenosis is nearly 8-39% among patients with stroke, and its management is still controversial. This study aimed to report the treatment results of bilateral carotid artery stenosis with simultaneous bilateral angioplasty and stenting (sbCAS) in a single institution during the last 10 years. 315 patients underwent carotid stenting in the Scientific-Practical Center of Endovascular Neuroradiology, NAMS of Ukraine during 2010-2020. 39 (12.4%) patients (mean age 57.9Â±2.1 - 28 men) underwent sbCAS. Primary clinical endpoints (stroke, myocardial infarction, or death) and secondary endpoints (hemodynamic depression (HD) - hypotension (<90 mmHg) or bradycardia (<60 bpm) and hyperperfusion syndrome (HPS) were evaluated. All sbCAS were technically successful, and a reduction of stenosis was noted in each case. There were two periprocedural neurological complications, one transient ischemic attack (TIA), and one minor stroke with the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) - 3 at discharge. No myocardial infarction (MI) or death during hospitalization was noted. 28 patients (71.8%) had HD, and 2 (5.1%) had HPS. All patients except those with periprocedural stroke were discharged or transferred to another hospital without neurological deterioration. sbCAS is an effective and relatively safe procedure for carefully selected patients with bilateral carotid stenosis. Patients with bilateral carotid stenosis should be carefully examined, and the best treatment strategy should be assessed using a multidisciplinary approach taking into account the possibility of sbCAS.
