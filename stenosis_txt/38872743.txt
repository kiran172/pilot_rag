Title: Diagnostic approach and treatment of ventricular septal defect associated with PDA, coarctation of aorta, hypoplastic aortic arch and multiple valvular heart disease in a tertiary center: An infrequent association.

Abstract: Ventricular septal defect is the most common congenital heart disease in children and is associated with patent ductus arteriosus in 1%-7% of cases. The coexistence of both malformities with hypoplastic aortic arch and aortic coarctation is even rarer. We present the case of a 6-year-old girl referred to our hospital because of dyspnea on feeding, recurrent respiratory infections, poor weight gain, and a heart murmur. The image studies revealed a ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, severe hypoplasia of the aortic arch with critical stenosis of the proximal portion, severe dilatation of the pulmonary artery and pulmonary, mitral, tricuspid, and aortic regurgitation. We will discuss the diagnostic approach and treatment in a tertiary reference center for patients with cardiovascular diseases.
