Title: Effect of acute intravenous beta-blocker administration on myocardial blood flow during same-day hybrid CCTA/PET imaging.

Abstract: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of acute intravenous beta-blocker administration on myocardial blood flow (MBF) during same-day hybrid coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and 13N-ammonia positron emission tomography (PET) myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). Previous research on the discontinuation of oral beta-blockers before MPI has shown mixed results, with no studies yet exploring the acute intravenous administration in the context of same-day hybrid imaging. This retrospective study included patients with suspected chronic coronary syndromes undergoing same-day hybrid CCTA/13N-ammonia PET MPI. Exclusion criteria comprised coronary artery stenosis ≥ 50% or regional perfusion abnormalities on PET, and baseline oral beta-blocker medication. Intravenous metoprolol (up to 30 mg) was administered as needed for heart rate control before CCTA. MBF measurements were obtained at rest (rMBF) and during stress (sMBF), and myocardial flow reserve (MFR) was calculated. After excluding 281 patients, 154 were eligible for propensity-score matching, resulting in 108 patients divided into two equal groups based on beta-blocker administration. The groups showed no significant differences in baseline characteristics. Among those who received beta-blockers, there was a significant decrease in sMBF (2.21 [IQR 1.72-2.78] versus 2.46 [2.08-2.99] ml∙min-1∙g-1, p = 0.027) and MFR (3.46 [2.70-4.05] versus 3.79 [3.22-4.46], p = 0.030), respectively, compared to those who did not receive beta-blockers. In contrast, rMBF remained unaffected (0.65 [0.54-0.78] versus 0.64 [0.55-0.76] ml∙min-1∙g-1, p = 0.931). Acute intravenous beta-blocker administration significantly impacts MBF, leading to a slight reduction in sMBF and MFR. In contrast, rMBF appears unaffected, suggesting that beta-blockers primarily affect the coronary capacity to respond to vasodilators.
