Title: Clinical situations requiring radial or brachial access during carotid artery stenting.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Radial or brachial access may be preferred in the case of severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) or difficult aortic arch anatomy during carotid artery stenting (CAS).
AIM: To evaluate the clinical conditions indicating potential benefit from non-femoral access as well as feasibility and safety of transradial/transbrachial access (TRA/TBA) as an alternative approach for CAS.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Since 2013, 67 patients (mean age: 70 years old, 44 men, 42% symptomatic) were selected for CAS with the TRA/TBA approach. The composite endpoint was stroke/death/myocardial infarction within 30 days of the procedure and compared to the propensity score matched transfemoral approach (TFA) group. Clinical (including neurological) examination and Doppler ultrasonography were performed before the procedure, at discharge and at 30 days.
RESULTS: CAS with TRA/TBA was successful in 63/67 patients. Transfemoral access was not feasible due to PAD in 35 (52.2%) patients, bovine arch in 10 (14.9%), obesity (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2) in 9 (13.4%), severe degenerative disease of the spine in 7 (10.5%), arch type III in 5 (7.5%) and excessive subclavian stent protrusion in 1 (1.5%) patient. Mean NASCET carotid artery stenosis was reduced from 81% to 9% (p &lt; 0.001). The composite endpoint occurred in 3 (4.8%) cases and it was not statistically significantly different from the matched TFA group (6.3%; p = 0.697). No access site complications requiring surgical intervention or blood transfusion developed.
CONCLUSIONS: Transradial and transbrachial CAS may be an effective and safe procedure, and it may constitute a viable alternative to the femoral approach in patients with severe PAD, difficult aortic arch anatomy or obesity.
