Title: Acute and episodic vestibular syndromes caused by ischemic stroke: predilection sites and risk factors.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to investigate the predilection sites of acute vestibular syndrome (AVS) and episodic vestibular syndrome (EVS) caused by acute infarcts.
METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was performed at a stroke center in a tertiary teaching hospital. We diagnosed patients with AVS/EVS caused by acute ischemic stroke using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and magnetic resonance angiography.
RESULTS: Among all patients with AVS/EVS, 68 had DWI-positive ischemic events and 113 had DWI-negative ischemic events. Of the 68 patients with positive DWI findings, 42.6% had acute infarcts in the anterior circulation and 41.2% had acute infarcts in the posterior circulation. The main stroke predilection sites were the insular cortex (22.1%) and posterior thalamus (11.8%). Large vessel stenosis/occlusion (odds ratio, 0.12; 95% confidence interval, 0.04–0.36) and focal neurological symptoms/signs (odds ratio, 0.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.10–0.72) were significantly associated with the risk of AVS/EVS in patients with acute ischemic stroke.
CONCLUSIONS: The main predilection sites of AVS/EVS caused by ischemic stroke are the insular cortex and posterior thalamus. The risk of AVS/EVS is associated with large vessel stenosis and focal symptoms.
