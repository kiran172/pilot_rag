Title: Correlation between Ultrasound Peak Systolic Velocity and Angiography for Grading Internal Carotid Artery Stenosis.

Abstract: (1) Background: The success of carotid revascularization depends on the accurate grading of carotid stenoses. Therefore, it is important for every vascular center to establish its protocols for the same. In this study, we aimed to determine the peak systolic velocity (PSV) thresholds that can predict moderate and severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses. (2) Methods: To achieve this, we enrolled patients who underwent both duplex ultrasound (DUS) and invasive carotid artery digital subtraction angiography (DSA). The degree of ICA stenosis was assessed using the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) and the European Carotid Surgery Trial (ECST) protocols. The PSV thresholds were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. (3) Results: Our study included 47 stenoses, and we found that the PSV cut-off for predicting ≥70% NASCET ICA stenoses was 200 cm/s (sensitivity 90.32%, specificity 93.75%). However, PSV did not correlate significantly with ≥50% NASCET ICA stenoses. On the other hand, the optimal PSV threshold for predicting ≥80% ECST ICA stenoses was 180 cm/s (sensitivity 100%, specificity 81.82%). (4) Conclusions: Based on our findings, we concluded that PSV is a good and simple marker for the identification of severe stenoses. We found that PSV values correlate significantly with severe NASCET and ECST stenoses, with 200 cm/s and 180 cm/s PSV thresholds. However, PSV was not reliable with moderate NASCET stenoses. In such cases, complementary imaging should be used.
