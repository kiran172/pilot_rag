Title: Pseudobronchial crista-like change in children: A case report.

Abstract: Pseudobronchial crista-like change is an unusual type of inflammatory granulation tissue hyperplasia in the endobronchial membrane caused by chronic retention of bronchial foreign bodies. Here, we report a case of pseudobronchial crista-like change in a 4-year-old boy who required admission for intermittent cough for >10 days and wheezing for 2 days. The main manifestation was persistent and non-healing lobar pneumonia. Initial electronic bronchoscopy showed cristae at the distal left main bronchus, which was misdiagnosed as bronchial opening stenosis. Repeat electronic bronchoscopy was performed after standard antibiotic treatment proved ineffective. Foreign bodies were observed at the opening of the basal branch of the left lower lobe. The left main bronchial cristae were clamped. The cristae appeared to be a pseudobronchial crista-like change caused by long-term retention of bronchial foreign bodies. After CT-confirmation of no abnormal blood supply at the cristae, the bronchial foreign bodies were removed, and the distal cristae of the left main bronchus were cut-off by laser, followed by balloon dilatation. To our knowledge, no similar cases have been reported so far in our review of domestic and foreign literature. Insufficient clinical understanding of Pseudobronchial Crista-like Change increase the risk of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Detailed exploration and careful identification under bronchoscopy are helpful for the timely diagnosis and treatment of Pseudobronchial Crista-like Change.
