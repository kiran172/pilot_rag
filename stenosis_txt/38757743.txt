Title: Managing chronic coronary syndrome: how do we achieve optimal patient outcomes?

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chronic coronary syndrome (CCS) remains the leading cause of death worldwide with high admission/re-admission rates. Medical databases were searched on CCS & its management.
AREAS COVERED: This review discusses phenotypes per stress-echocardiography, noninvasive/invasive testing (coronary computed-tomography angiography-CCTA; coronary artery calcium - CAC score; echocardiography assessing wall-motion, LV function, valvular disease; biomarkers), multidisciplinary management (risk factors/anti-inflammatory/anti-ischemic/antithrombotic therapies and revascularization), newer treatments (colchicine/ivabradine/ranolazine/melatonin), cardiac rehabilitation/exercise improving physical activity and quality-of-life, use of the implantable-defibrillator, and treatment with extracorporeal shockwave-revascularization for refractory symptoms.
EXPERT OPINION: CCS is age-dependent, leading cause of death worldwide with high hospitalization rates. Stress-echocardiography defines phenotypes and guides prophylaxis and management. CAC is a surrogate for atherosclerosis burden, best for patients of intermediate/borderline risk. Higher CAC-scores indicate more severe coronary abnormalities. CCTA is preferred for noninvasive detection of CAC and atherosclerosis burden, determining stenosis' functional significance, and guiding management. Combining CAC score with CCTA improves diagnostic yield and assists prognosis. Echocardiography assesses LV wall-motion and function and valvular disease. Biomarkers guide diagnosis/prognosis. CCS management is multidisciplinary: risk-factor management, anti-inflammatory/anti-ischemic/antithrombotic therapies, and revascularization. Newer therapies comprise colchicine, ivabradine, ranolazine, melatonin, glucagon-like peptide-1-receptor antagonists. Cardiac rehabilitation/exercise improves physical activity and quality-of-life. An ICD protects from sudden death. Extracorporeal shockwave-revascularization treats refractory symptoms.
