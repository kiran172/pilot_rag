Title: Coronary-subclavian steal syndrome causing myocardial infarction after arteriovenous fistula creation: a case report.

Abstract: Coronary subclavian steal syndrome (CSSS) caused by left subclavian artery (LSA) stenosis is a rare cause of myocardial infarction in patients having coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and it has also been observed after an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) was made. A 79-year-old woman who had undergone CABG years earlier and an AVF creation 1Â month before experienced a non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). While selective catheterization of the left internal thoracic artery graft was impossible, a computed tomography scanner showed patency of all bypasses and proximal subocclusive LSA stenosis, and the digital blood pressure measurements objectified a haemodialysis-induced distal ischaemia. LSA's angioplasty and covered stent placement were successfully performed, resulting in symptom remission. A CSSS-induced NSTEMI due to a LSA stenosis aggravated by a homolateral AVF several years after CABG has been documented only infrequently. If vascular access is required in the presence of CSSS risk factors, the contralateral upper limb should be preferred.
