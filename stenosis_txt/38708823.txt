Title: Snuffbox distal transradial access (dTRA) for arteriovenous fistuloplasty in Singapore: Going distal is safe.

Abstract: AIM: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) dysfunction resulting from stenosis or occlusion, is a prevalent issue in end-stage renal failure patients reliant on autogenous AVFs for dialysis. Recently, a distal transradial approach (dTRA) has emerged, offering advantages such as diminished access site complications, better patient comfort and reduced risk of radial artery occlusion. Our study seeks to assess the effectiveness, outcomes and complication rates of employing dTRA for arteriovenous fistuloplasty in Singaporean patients.
METHODS: A retrospective review of all dTRA fistuloplasties performed on dysfunctional or slow to mature AVFs from 2017 to 2023 in our institution was performed. Patients with a distal radial artery measuring 2 mm or more with no evidence of occlusion or thrombosis were included. Patients who required central venoplasty or cutting balloon angioplasty were excluded. Outcome measures included technical success, mean procedure duration, complications and post-intervention primary patency at 1, 3 and 6 months. Patients were followed up for 12 months post-intervention.
RESULTS: A total of 37 patients were included. 97.3% of patients undergoing dTRA fistuloplasty had radiocephalic fistulas while 2.7% had brachiobasilic fistulas. There was 100% technical success (defined as success in radial artery cannulation, sheath insertion and crossing of stenotic lesions) in our study as all patients successfully underwent fistuloplasty via dTRA approach. One-month patency rate was 97.4%, 3-month patency rate was 92.1% and 6-month patency rate was 86.8%. There were no immediate complications (haematoma, infection, bleeding, pseudoaneurysm, occlusion) of the radial artery post-intervention.
CONCLUSION: Our paper illustrates the safety and efficacy of utilising dTRA for arteriovenous fistuloplasty. This approach offers distinct benefits in addressing non-mature or dysfunctional distal forearm arteriovenous fistulas and should be taken into account in anatomically suitable cases.
