Title: Uric acid and evaluate the coronary vascular stenosis gensini score correlation research and in gender differences.

Abstract: BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Recent studies have shown that the negative effect of uric acid (UA) on coronary arteries determines the severity of atherosclerotic disease. This study aims to explore the relationship between serum UA level and Gensini score, which reflects the severity of coronary artery disease.
METHODS: A total of 860 patients with suspected coronary heart disease who were admitted to hospital due to angina pectoris or myocardial ischemia related symptoms and received coronary angiography were selected. Based on the findings of the angiography, they were categorized into two groups: the coronary heart disease (CHD) group (n = 625) and the control group (n = 235). The uric acid levels and other clinical data were compared between these groups. Additionally, the prevalence of coronary heart disease and Gensini score were compared between the groups, considering gender-specific quartiles of uric acid levels. The clinical baseline data were analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent risk factors for coronary heart disease.
RESULTS: Of 860 patients (mean age, 63.97 ± 11.87 years), 528 were men (mean age, 62.06 ± 11.5 years) and 332 were women (mean age, 66.99 ± 10.11 years). The proportion of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia in the coronary heart disease group was higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). HbA1C, Gensini score, BMI, TG and hsCRP in the coronary heart disease group were higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05), and HDL-C was lower than that in the control group (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in age, heart rate, Cr, TC and LDL-C between the two groups (P > 0.05).Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, hypertension, hsCRP and SUA levels increased the risk of coronary heart disease, and the difference was statistically significant(OR = 1.034,95%CI 1.016-1.052, P = 0.001; OR = 1.469,95%CI 1.007-2.142, P = 0.046;OR = 1.064,95%CI 1.026-1.105, P = 0.001; OR = 1.011,95%CI 1.008-1.014, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Serum uric acid is positively correlated with Gensini score in patients with coronary heart disease, which is an independent factor for evaluating the degree of coronary artery stenosis and has a predictive effect.
