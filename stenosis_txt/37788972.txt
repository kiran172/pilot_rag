Title: Negative Effects of Diffuse Idiopathic Skeletal Hyperostosis on Bone Fusion after Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: This study adopted a retrospective cohort study design.
PURPOSE: This study aimed to clarify the influence of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) on bone fusion after transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF).
OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: The negative effects of DISH on lumbar degenerative diseases have been reported, and DISH may be involved in the onset and severity of lumbar spinal canal stenosis. Patients with DISH have significantly more reoperations after posterior lumbar fusion, including TLIF. However, the effects of DISH on bone fusion after TLIF have not been reported.
METHODS: The medical records of patients with intervertebral TLIF from 2012 to 2018 were retrospectively examined. The patients were divided into those with fusion and those with pseudoarthrosis, and the following data were compared: age, sex, DISH, diabetes mellitus, smoking, drinking, albumin levels, body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, and L5/S fixation. Statistical analyses were performed using regression models.
RESULTS: In this study, 180 patients (78.6%) had fusion and 49 patients (21.4%) had pseudoarthrosis. The number of patients with DISH was significantly higher in the pseudoarthrosis group than in the fusion group (36.7% and 21.7%, respectively; univariate p=0.031, multivariate p =0.019). No significant differences in age, sex, diabetes mellitus, smoking, drinking, albumin levels, body mass index ≥30 kg/m2, and L5/S fixation were observed between the two groups. The risk factors for bone fusion were statistically analyzed in 57 patients with DISH. DISH with a caudal end below Th11 was an independent risk factor for pseudoarthrosis (univariate p=0.011, multivariate p=0.033).
CONCLUSIONS: DISH is an independent risk factor for pseudoarthrosis after one intervertebral TLIF, and DISH with a caudal end below Th11 is associated with a higher risk of pseudoarthrosis than DISH without a caudal end below Th11.
