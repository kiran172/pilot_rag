Title: Late outcomes of surgical reconstruction of peripheral pulmonary arteries.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: The ideal management of peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is still controversial. We adopted a primary surgical approach to this complex lesion with excellent early outcomes. In this study, we analyzed our late outcomes.
METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of 91 patients with biventricular anatomy who underwent peripheral pulmonary artery reconstruction from March 2008 to July 2020. Our surgical approach included either a single-stage complete repair through median sternotomy or a 2-stage repair through sternotomy/left thoracotomy, depending on the degree of distal involvement of the left pulmonary artery branches.
RESULTS: Median age was 26 months. Syndromic etiology was established in 54 patients (59.3%) versus nonsyndromic etiology in 37 patients (40.7%). Single-stage repair was achieved in 68 patients (74.7%). There were 2 (2.2%) in-hospital mortalities. The mean right ventricular to aortic systolic pressure ratio decreased from 1.07 ± 0.20 preoperatively to 0.32 ± 0.07 immediately postoperatively (P < .001), representing a 70.1% reduction. At 1-year postoperative catheterization, the mean right ventricular to aortic systolic pressure ratio was 0.28 ± 0.05 (P < .001 compared with immediately postoperative value). With a median follow-up of 68 months (IQR, 39-117.5 months), there was no late mortality after discharge. All patients were active and asymptomatic on the most recent follow-up. There were no early or late reinterventions on pulmonary arteries.
CONCLUSIONS: Late outcomes of surgical reconstruction of peripheral pulmonary arteries are excellent and durable in various pathologies (syndromic and nonsyndromic) with a significant reduction in right ventricular to aortic systolic pressure ratio, low mortality, and no reintervention.
