Title: A rare complication following internal jugular vein catheterization to malposition: acute Budd Chiari syndrome.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Tunneled catheters can be used as an alternative vascular access in patients with limited health expectancy,vascular access problems and several comorbidities. We aimed to present a patient with venous stenosis related- reversible acute Budd-Chiari syndrome after catheter malposition.
CASE PRESENTATION: After changing of tunneled catheter insertion, 36-year old man was admitted to our hospital with sudden onset of nausea, fever, chills and worsening general condition In computed tomography (CT) imaging, a hypodense thrombus was observed in which the distal end of the catheter is at the level of drainage of the hepatic veins in the inferior vena cava and that blocked hepatic vein drainage around the catheter. The catheter was removed and a new catheter was inserted in the same session. Because patient's general condition was good and without fever, he was discharged with advices on the 9th day of hospitalization.
CONCLUSION: Although catheter malposition and thrombosis are not a common complication, clinicians should be alert of these complications.
