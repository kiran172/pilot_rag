Title: [Safety and efficacy of acute stent implantation during endovascular treatment for patients with emergent large vessel occlusion due to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis].

Abstract: Objective: To investigate the efficacy and safety of acute stent implantation during endovascular treatment for patients with emergent large vessel occlusion due to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis. Methods: A retrospective analysis was carried out on 46 patients with emergent large vessel occlusion due to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis who received endovascular treatment at the Strategic Support Force Medical Center from January 2015 to August 2022. Twenty-seven patients underwent balloon angioplasty alone and 19 patients underwent acute stent implantation. The baseline characteristics, modified thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (mTICI) score of the responsible vessels, modified Rankin scale (mRS) score 90 days after operation, incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality of the two groups were evaluated. Results: The proportion of effective recanalization of the offending vessels (mTICIâ‰¥2b) in the acute stenting group was slightly higher than that in the balloon angioplasty group (16/19 vs. 81.5%), but the difference was not statistically significant (P&gt;0.05). Besides, there was no significant difference in the median of mRS between the acute stenting group [3.0(0, 4.0)] and the balloon angioplasty group [4.0(1.0, 5.0)] 90 days after operation (P&gt;0.05). In terms of safety, the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality were comparable between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Conclusions: The effect of acute stent implantation during endovascular treatment for patients with emergent large vessel occlusion due to intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis is not inferior to that of balloon angioplasty, and it does not increase the risk of intracranial bleeding complications.
