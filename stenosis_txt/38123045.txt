Title: Low- or standard-dose edoxaban versus antiplatelet therapy for leaflet thrombus and cerebral thromboembolism after TAVR: A prespecified analysis of randomized ADAPT-TAVR trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The risks of leaflet thrombosis and the associated cerebral thromboembolism are unknown according to different anticoagulation dosing after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The aim was to evaluate the incidence of leaflet thrombosis and cerebral thromboembolism between low-dose (30 mg) or standard-dose (60 mg) edoxaban and dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) after TAVR.
METHODS: In this prespecified subgroup analysis of the ADAPT-TAVR trial, the primary endpoint was the incidence of leaflet thrombosis on 4-dimensional computed tomography at 6-months. Key secondary endpoints were new cerebral lesions on brain magnetic resonance imaging and neurological and neurocognitive dysfunction.
RESULTS: Of 229 patients enrolled in this study, 118 patients were DAPT group and 111 were edoxaban group (43 [39.1%] 60 mg vs 68 [61.3%] 30 mg). There was a significantly lower incidence of leaflet thrombosis in the standard-dose edoxaban group than in the DAPT group (2.4% vs 18.3%; odds ratio [OR] 0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.01-0.55; P = .03). However, no significant difference was observed between low-dose edoxaban and DAPT (15.0% vs 18.3%; OR 0.79; 95% CI, 0.32-1.81; P = .58). Irrespective of different antithrombotic regiments, the percentages of patients with new cerebral lesions on brain MRI and worsening neurological or neurocognitive function were not significantly different.
CONCLUSIONS: In patients without an indication for anticoagulation after TAVR, the incidence of leaflet thrombosis was significantly lower with standard-dose edoxaban but not with low-dose edoxaban, as compared with DAPT. However, this differential effect of edoxaban on leaflet thrombosis was not associated with a reduction of new cerebral thromboembolism and neurological dysfunction.
