Title: Multimodality evaluation of transcatheter structural valve degeneration at long-term follow-up.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES: We assessed the long-term hemodynamic performance of transcatheter heart valve (THV) by paired transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and the incidence, characteristics and factors associated with THV structural valve degeneration (SVD).
METHODS: A total of 212 patients who underwent transcatheter aortic valve replacement and had a potential follow-up &gt;5 years with at least 1 TTE ≥ 1-year postprocedure were included. All patients had a TTE at 1 to 5 years and 36 had another one at 6 to 10 years. SVD was defined as subclinical (increase &gt;10mmHg in mean transvalvular gradient+decrease &gt;0.3cm2 in valve area and/or new-onset mild or moderate aortic regurgitation) and clinically relevant (increase&gt; 20mmHg in mean transvalvular gradient+decrease&gt; 0.6cm2 in valve area and/or new-onset moderate-to-severe aortic regurgitation). Fifteen patients had a transesophageal echocardiography at the time of SVD diagnosis, and 85 an opportunistic computed tomography examination at 1 (0.5-2) years.
RESULTS: Transvalvular mean gradient increased and valve area decreased over time (P<.01). At 8 years of follow-up, SVD occurred in 30.2% of patients (clinically relevant: 9.3%). Transesophageal echocardiography revealed thickened and reduced-mobility leaflets in 80% and 73% of SVD cases, respectively. No baseline or procedural factors were associated with SVD. THV underexpansion (3.5%) or eccentricity (8.2%) had no impact on valve hemodynamics/SVD at follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: A gradual THV hemodynamic deterioration occurred throughout a 10-year period, leading to SVD in ∼30% of patients (clinically relevant in < 10%). Leaflet morphology/mobility were frequently impaired in SVD cases, but THV geometry did not influence valve hemodynamics or SVD.
