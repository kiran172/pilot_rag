Title: [Clinical analysis of fifteen transplant ureteral stricture cases].

Abstract: This research aims to explore the clinical characteristics and treatment of transplant ureteral strictures. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data from fifteen patients diagnosed with transplant ureteral stricture. Of the fifteen patients, five underwent regular ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube exchanges, while ten underwent open surgery. There were no significant differences in basic clinical characteristics between the two groups. The median follow-up time for regular ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube exchanges and open surgery group was 36.8 (11.8-56.0) months and 25.0 (4.5-31.2) months, respectively. Among patients who underwent regular exchanges, one required regular dialysis. Nine patients in the open surgery group had successful removal of the ureteral stent. Our findings suggest that regular ureteral stent or nephrostomy tube exchanges, as well as open surgery, are effective treatment options for transplant ureteral strictures.
