Title: Stent retriever angioplasty for acute atherosclerotic occlusion of vertebral artery.

Abstract: The established effectiveness of mechanical thrombectomy using a stent retriever or aspiration catheter for emergent large-vessel occlusion caused by cardiogenic embolic stroke is widely recognized. However, in cases of acute artery occlusion resulting from atherosclerotic disease, mechanical thrombectomy often encounters challenges in achieving consistent recanalization, and aggressive percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) with a balloon and/or stenting can potentially lead to arterial dissection or additional perforator infarction. We present the case of an 88-year-old man who experienced sudden unconsciousness and tetra-paresis, diagnosed with cerebral infarction resulting from right vertebral artery occlusion. During the mechanical thrombectomy procedure, we identified atheromatous disease. Considering the circumstances, we made the decision to maintain the stent placement for 30Â min following the loading of dual antiplatelet drugs. As a result, the right vertebral artery was successfully recanalized, although severe stenosis persisted. Two weeks after the initial procedure, we performed wingspan stent placement with a favorable outcome. Stent retriever angioplasty, using the deploy and re-sheath method, appears to be a viable option for managing acute atherosclerotic occlusion. This case highlights the challenges encountered in mechanical thrombectomy for atherosclerotic occlusion and demonstrates a potential approach to address this issue. By keeping the stent in place for a specific duration, combined with appropriate pharmacological intervention, recanalization was achieved, offering a promising therapeutic strategy for similar cases. Stent retriever angioplasty utilizing the deploy and re-sheath method emerges as a potential option for addressing acute atherosclerotic occlusion.
