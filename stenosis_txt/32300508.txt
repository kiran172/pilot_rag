Title: An Atypical Presentation of Median Arcuate Ligament Syndrome.

Abstract: Median arcuate ligament syndrome (MALS) is a rare condition where the celiac artery is compressed by the ligament, uniting the diaphragmatic crura of the aortic hiatus. Patients mostly present with abdominal symptoms. We present a case of a 51-year-old male who presented with abdominal pain. The patient was evaluated with a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and found to have celiac artery stenosis secondary to the median arcuate ligament (MAL). The patient was assessed by surgery and interventional radiology, but no intervention was offered. He was started on anticoagulation with spontaneous resolution of abdominal pain.
