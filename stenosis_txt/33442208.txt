Title: The impact of advances in percutaneous catheter interventions on redo cardiac surgery.

Abstract: Toward the end of the twentieth century, redo cardiac surgery accounted for approximately 15-20% of total cardiac surgical volume. Major risk factors for redo cardiac surgery include young age at time of the first operation, progression of native coronary artery disease (CAD), vein graft atherosclerosis, bioprosthetic valve failure and endocarditis, and transplantation for end stage heart failure. Historically, redo coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) alone carried a mortality risk of around 4%. Factors such as older age, female sex, comorbidities, combined procedures, hemodynamic instability, and emergency procedures contributed to even higher mortality and morbidity. These poor outcomes made it necessary to look for less invasive alternate methods of treatment. Advances in catheter-based interventions have made a major impact on redo cardiac surgeries, making it no longer the first option in a majority of cases. Percutaneous interventions for recurrence following CABG, transcutaneous aortic valve replacement (TAVR) for calcific aortic stenosis, valve in valve (VIV) implantations, device closure of paravalvular leaks (PVL), and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) for residual and recurrent aneurysms and mitral clip to correct mitral regurgitation (MR) in heart failure are rapidly developing or developed, obviating the need for redo cardiac surgery. Our intent is to review these advances and their impact on redo cardiac surgery.
