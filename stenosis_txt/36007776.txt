Title: Midterm Outcomes of Endovascular Therapy for TASC II D Femoropopliteal Lesions with Critical Limb Ischemia: A Retrospective Analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the midterm results of endovascular therapy (EVT) for Trans-Atlantic Inter-Society (TASC) II D femoropopliteal lesions in patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI).
METHODS: Fifty seven limbs of 54 patients with CLI due to TASC II D femoropopliteal lesions who underwent EVT at the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University were retrospectively analysed in a single-centre, observational study. The patient characteristics, endovascular procedural details, freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR), patency rates, ulcer healing rate, and limb salvage rate were accessed.
RESULTS: The patients' mean age was 68.2 ± 8.2 years. All patients were treated by EVT. The final technical success rate was 98.2% (56/57). There were 23 cases of pain at rest, 18 cases of ulcer, and 15 cases of gangrene. The median length of the treated segment was 286 ± 42 mm (56/56) and the mean number of stents placed per patient was 2.0 ± 0.8 (49/56). The postoperative ankle-brachial index was significantly higher than that of the preoperative ankle-brachial index (P < 0.05). The perioperative complication rate was 10.7% (6/56). The restenosis or occlusion rate was 44.6% (25/56). The estimated rates of freedom from TLR at 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years were 86.8%, 67.0%, and 62.5%, respectively. A univariate analysis showed that predictors of freedom from TLR were the number of runoff vessels, length of the lesion, and complexity of the lesion, while predictors for restenosis or occlusion were the length and the complexity of the lesion. The ulcer healing rate was 93.8%. The limb salvage rates were 76.4%, 74.4%, and 70.9% at 1, 2, and 3 years after treatment, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The midterm outcomes of EVT for TASC II D femoropopliteal lesions in patients with CLI indicated that this treatment approach is safe and effective and is clinically applicable.
