Title: Atypical extensive pancreatic pseudocyst with hemorrhage in a hemodialysis patient.

Abstract: Pancreatic pseudocysts are a common complication of both acute and chronic pancreatitis. The complications of pancreatic pseudocysts include compression of abdominal great vessels, gastric or duodenal stenosis, cholestasis due to stenosis of common bile duct, infection, and hemorrhage into the cyst. Moreover, pancreatic pseudocysts most commonly occur around the pancreas; however, extension into the adjacent viscera including spleen, liver, transverse colon, anterior or posterior pararenal space, retroperitoneum and mediastinum does occur infrequently. Here, we report a rare case of atypical extensive pancreatic pseudocyst with hemorrhage in a hemodialysis patient.
