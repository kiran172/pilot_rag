Title: Changes in intra- and extracranial carotid plaque calcification: a 2-year follow-up study.

Abstract: Extra- and intracranial carotid plaque calcification might have plaque-stabilizing effects, yet information on changes in plaque calcification remains scarce. We evaluated changes in carotid plaque calcification over 2 years follow-up in patients with symptomatic carotid artery disease. This study is based on the PARISK-study, a multicenter cohort study, with TIA/minor stroke patients with ipsilateral mild-to-moderate carotid artery stenosis (< 70%). We included 79 patients (25% female, mean age 66 years) who underwent CTA imaging with 2 year interval. We assessed the volume of extra- and intracranial carotid artery calcification (ECAC and ICAC) and calculated the difference between baseline and follow-up ECAC and ICAC volume. We performed multivariable regression analyses to investigate the association between change of ECAC or ICAC with cardiovascular determinants. ECAC. We found increase (46.2%) and decrease (34%) in ECAC volume during 2 year follow-up, both significantly correlation with baseline ECAC volume (OR = 0.72, 95% CI 0.58-0.90 respectively OR = 2.24, 95% CI 1.60-3.13).We found significant correlation for change in ECAC volume with diabetes (β = 0.46, 95% CI 0.03-0.89) and baseline ECAC volume (β = 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.88). ICAC. We found increase (45.0%) and decrease (25.0%) in ICAC volume. The ICAC decrease was significantly correlated with baseline ICAC volume (OR = 2.17, 95% CI 1.48-3.16), age (OR = 2.00, 95% CI 1.19-3.38) and use of antihypertensive drugs (OR = 3.79, 95% CI 1.20-11.96]).The overall change of ICAC volume was also significantly correlated with diabetes (β = 0.92, 95% CI 1.59-7.02), use of oral hypoglycemic drugs (β = 0.86, 95% CI 0.12-1.59) and baseline ICAC volume (β = 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.87). We provide novel insights into the dynamics of carotid plaque calcification in symptomatic stroke patients.
