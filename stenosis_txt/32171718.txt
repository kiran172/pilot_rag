Title: Late Cerebrovascular Events Following Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study sought to determine the incidence, clinical characteristics, associated factors, and outcomes of late cerebrovascular events (LCVEs) (>30 days post-procedure) following transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
BACKGROUND: Scarce data exist on LCVEs following TAVR.
METHODS: This was a multicenter study including 3,750 consecutive patients (mean age, 80 ± 8 years; 50.5% of women) who underwent TAVR and survived beyond 30 days. LCVEs were defined according to the Valve Academic Research Consortium 2 (VARC 2) criteria.
RESULTS: LCVEs occurred in 192 (5.1%) patients (stroke, 80.2%; transient ischemic attack, 19.8%) after a median follow-up of 2 (1 to 4) years. Late stroke was of ischemic, hemorrhagic, and undetermined origin in 80.5%, 18.8%, and 0.7% of patients, respectively. Older age, previous cerebrovascular disease, higher mean aortic gradient at baseline, the occurrence of stroke during the periprocedural TAVR period, and the lack of anticoagulation (novel oral anticoagulants or vitamin K antagonists) post-TAVR were independent factors associated with late ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (p < 0.05 for all). Echocardiographic data at the time of the LCVE showed no signs of valve thrombosis or degeneration in the vast majority (97%) patients. Late stroke was disabling in 107 (69.5%) patients (ischemic, 68%; hemorrhagic, 79%), and associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 29.2%.
CONCLUSIONS: LCVEs occurred in 5.1% of TAVR recipients after a median follow-up of 2 years. LCVEs were ischemic in most cases, with older age, previous cerebrovascular events, higher mean aortic gradient at baseline, the occurrence during the periprocedural TAVR period, and lack of anticoagulation (but not valve thrombosis/degeneration) determining an increased risk. Late stroke was disabling in most cases and associated with dreadful early and midterm outcomes.
