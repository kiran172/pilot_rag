Title: Comparison between umbilical and right upper transverse abdominal incisions for pyloromyotomy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the operative parameters and complication rates between the umbilical (UMB) and right upper quadrant (RUQ) skin incisions for Ramstedt's pyloromyotomy for the treatment of infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS). PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Scopus databases were systematically searched. The studies where any one of the main outcomes of interest, i.e., operative time, wound infection rate, mucosal perforation rate were reported were eligible for inclusion. The statistical analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed utilizing the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Fifteen studies comprising 2964 infants were included. As compared to the UMB group, the RUQ group showed a significantly lower mean operative time (p = 0.0004), wound infection rate (p < 0.0001) and mucosal perforation rate (p = 0.02). Although UMB incision produces an almost undetectable scar, this approach results in significantly more complications. Therefore, the risks and benefits must be weighed and discussed with the caregivers in deciding the surgical approach in patients with IHPS. However, due to a poor methodological quality of nine out of fifteen studies, further studies need to be conducted for an optimal comparison between the two groups.
