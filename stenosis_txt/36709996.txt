Title: A Non-Linear Role of Hyperlipidemia on Progression of Intracranial Atherosclerotic Plaques and Acute Downstream Ischemic Events.

Abstract: AIM: Intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS) is the leading cause of ischemic stroke worldwide. Hyperlipidemia is a major contributor to atherosclerosis. However, the effect of hyperlipidemia on the evolution of intracranial atherosclerotic plaques and downstream ischemic episodes remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the radiological features of ICAS plaques and to explore the relationship between hyperlipidemia and plaque progression.
METHODS: We included people with ICAS (≥50% stenosis) undergoing high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. The culprit plaque was defined as the sole, or in case of multiple stenosis, the narrowest plaque on the intracranial artery responsible for acute ischemic stroke. Demographic, clinical data, plaque features on MRI, and lipid parameters were compared between culprit and non-culprit plaques. Plaque enhancement was graded as Grade 0, 1 and 2 by comparing to the adjacent normal vessel wall and pituitary funnel after contrast enhancement on T1-weighted sequences.
RESULTS: 162 patients were included (mean age 57.7±12.1 years, male 61.6%), 110 of whom were identified as culprit plaque with an ipsilateral acute stroke. High-grade enhancement was the most prominent MRI feature of the culpable plaque (Grade-2: OR 6.539, 95%CI 1.706-23.707, p=0.006). LDL cholesterol was significantly associated with overall acute ischemic stroke caused by culprit plaque. After stratification by enhancement grading LDL was independently associated with ischemic events in Grade-1 enhancement plaques (OR 6.778, 95%CI 2.122-21.649, p=0.001). In patients with Grade-2 enhancement plaques, however, LDL was not associated with ischemic event; in contrast, Neutrophil/Lymphocyte ratio was independently associated with ischemic events caused by Grade-2 enhancement plaques (OR 2.188, 95%CI 1.209-3.961, p=0.010).
CONCLUSIONS: LDL was related with ischemia events in intermediate stage of intracranial atherosclerotic plaque progression, an excellent period for intensive lipid-lowering treatment. In advanced stage, inflammatory agents maybe the main contributor to ischemic events.
