Title: [Conduction disorders after transcatheter aortic valve implantation: incidence, characteristics, and clinical management].

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation may be complicated by the development of conduction disturbances, including left bundle branch block and high-grade atrioventricular blocks, especially in patients with predisposing risk factors, such as pre-existing right bundle branch block. Permanent pacemaker implantation is a procedure with potential short- and long-term complications, and it should be reserved to patients with appropriate indications. Electrophysiological testing and/or prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring are valuable tools for stratifying the risk of pacemaker implantation. However, the management of new-onset conduction disorders is not always straightforward, and there are different approaches depending on the center's attitude. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to define clinical management based on current evidence, while awaiting data from randomized trials.
