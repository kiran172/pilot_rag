Title: The effect of complete revascularization in patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction with Killip class ≥ III.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The effect of complete revascularization (CR) on high-risk patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) has remains a controversial issue, especially on patients in a critical condition. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of CR on patients with STEMI with Killip class ≥ III.
METHODS: From January 2008 to December 2014, 185 patients diagnosed with STEMI with Killip class ≥ III and multiple vessel coronary artery disease received primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Eighty-nine patients underwent culprit-only PCI, and the remaining 96 patients underwent immediate or staged PCI for CR. Out of the 96 patients in the CR group, 51 patients underwent immediate CR, and 45 patients underwent CR during the same hospitalization. Thirty-day and 1-year clinical outcomes were compared between the culprit-only PCI group and the CR group as well as between the immediate CR group and staged CR group.
RESULTS: There was a trend toward a lower incidence of post-PCI acute kidney injury in the culprit-only PCI group when compared with the CR group (14.8% vs. 26.0%; P = 0.069). Thirty-day and 1-year cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality were similar between the culprit-only PCI group and CR group. Decreased 1-year cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality were noted in the staged CR group compared with the immediate CR group.
CONCLUSION: was associated a higher possibility of post-PCI acute kidney injury and did not seem to improve 30-day or 1-year clinical outcomes. Patients undergoing staged CR during the same hospitalization had better clinical outcomes.
