Title: The role of gel-infused translabial ultrasound as a new modality in evaluation of female urethral stricture.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: To investigate the role of trans-labial ultrasound study in detection of female urethral stenosis (FUS) compared to former cysto-urethroscopy as the currently available definitive diagnostic modality.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 60 consecutive patients with bladder outlet obstruction diagnosed by clinical symptoms and urodynamic study, were included from 2019 to 2022. For additional assessment, all these patients underwent gel-Infused trans-labial ultrasound (GITLUS) and cystourethroscopy. Trans-labial real-time ultrasonography was performed following the insertion of 20 ml steady stream viscous jelly into the urethral meatus to assess the length of the urethra and exact location and length of the probable narrowing, as well as the presence of peri-urethral fibrosis (PUF).
RESULTS: In GITLUS evaluation, urethral stricture was found in 27 patients. Mean urethral length and stricture length were 35.63 ±4.78 and 17.04 ±10.59, respectively. All these stenosis were confirmed via cysto-urethroscopy. PUF was found in 20 of 27 patients. In cysto-urethroscopy, urethral stricture was confirmed in 40 patients: 13 in urethral meatus and 27 in other parts or pan-urethra. GITLUS could not reveal urethral stricture in 13 patients with meatal stenosis, confirmed with cystoscopy. GITLUS detected FUS less accurately when it involves pure distal urethra compared to other parts of urethra or pan-urethral stenosis (p value = 0.002).
CONCLUSIONS: GITLUS is a safe, non-invasive, and valuable technique for detecting FUS. The location and the length of the stricture and probable peri-urethral fibrosis can be identified by this method. However, in meatal or pure short-length distal urethral strictures, this method should be used with caution.
