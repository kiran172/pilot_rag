Title: Efficacy of drug-coated balloon catheters for patients with short-term recurrent dysfunction of arteriovenous fistula.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: In this study, we aimed at clarifying the usefulness of drug-coated balloon catheters (DCBs) for arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) that repeatedly undergo restenosis over a short period and to examine the factors that influence the patency period after DCB use.
METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted using IN.PACT AV in 29 cases of AVFs with repeated restenosis within approximately 3 months, and temporary patency before and after DCB use in the same patients was compared. For target participants, the flow volume, resistive index (RI), and vascular diameter of the brachial artery were measured using an ultrasound diagnostic device. Stenosis diameter, reference vessel diameter, and stenosis length of the lesion were measured before and after DCB dilatation using digital subtraction angiography.
RESULTS: Before DCB angioplasty, the postintervention primary patency at 3 months was 66%, and the average interval was 92 ± 21 days (mean ± standard deviation). After DCB angioplasty, the postintervention primary patency rates at 3 and 6 months were 92% and 36%, respectively. The postintervention primary patency was significantly higher after than before DCB angioplasty (p &lt; 0.0001). A sub-analysis was performed on 25 patients who were followed up for 4 months or more after DCB. The RI values before and after dilatation with DCB significantly differed between the patency group 4 or more months after DCB and the patency group less than 4 months after DCB.
CONCLUSION: For AVFs that require frequent PTA over a short period of time, DCB improved the patency rate 3 months after PTA, but the improvement effect at 6 months was limited. The effect of DCB on prolonging the patency rate of AVFs that require frequent PTA over a short period of time may be correlated with the RI value before and after PTA.
