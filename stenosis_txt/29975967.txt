Title: Impact of Patient-Prosthesis Mismatch following Aortic Valve Replacement on Long-Term Survival and Quality of Life.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The impact of patient-prosthesis mismatch (PPM) after aortic valve replacement (AVR) on long-term survival and quality of life (QoL) remains controversial. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of PPM on long-term survival and QoL in a large cohort of patients treated with isolated stented biological AVR in a single-center experience.
METHODS: We analyzed data of 632 consecutive patients following isolated stented biological AVR between 2007 and 2012 at our institution. We evaluated the QoL (393 evaluable patients) using the Short Form 12-item Health Survey (SF-12) questionnaire via telephone call and the impact of PPM on long-term survival (533 evaluable patients) by Kaplan-Meier's estimate.
RESULTS: Severe PPM (&lt;0.65 cm2/m2) had a negative impact on physical component summary (PCS) score (SF-12) compared with patients with moderate or no PPM (p = 0.014), while the mental component summary (MCS) score (SF-12) was not affected by the degree of PPM (p = 0.133). Long-term survival was not different among the three different PPM groups investigated (p = 0.75).
CONCLUSION: Severity of PPM demonstrated no influence on long-term survival and MCS score (SF-12), but it was associated with a lower PCS score (SF-12) in patients with severe PPM.
