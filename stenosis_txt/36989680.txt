Title: Clinical characteristics of endovascular treatment for acute ischemic stroke with atherosclerotic etiology: Factors associating its clinical outcome.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Clinical characteristics of endovascular treatment (EVT) for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to atherosclerosis are not fully delineated. An optimal treatment strategy with considerations of stroke etiology has not yet been established. Here-in, we performed retrospective analysis of EVT for atherosclerotic AIS.
METHODS: Data from patients with AIS who underwent EVT between 2017 and 2022 were analyzed. Clinical characteristics, procedural data, and outcomes were assessed. Further analysis was conducted to elucidate the factors associated with clinical outcomes. And data of patients with poor clinical outcomes (mRS, 5 or 6) were evaluated further to determine the primary cause.
RESULTS: Among 194 patients who received EVT, 40 (20.6%) were diagnosed with AIS with an atherosclerotic etiology. The rates of successful reperfusion (TICI 2b or 3) and good clinical outcomes (mRS, 0-2) were 95.0% and 45.0%, respectively. No procedure-related complications were noted. Older age (p = 0.007), more severe baseline NIHSS score (p = 0.004), lesion in the posterior circulation (p = 0.025), and recanalization failure (p = 0.027) were more frequently observed in patients with poor clinical outcomes. Brainstem infarction and postprocedural intracerebral hemorrhage were the main reasons for poor clinical outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The EVT for atherosclerotic AIS were effective and safe. Older age, more severe NIHSS score, lesions in the posterior circulation, and recanalization failure were the factors associated with poor clinical outcomes. It is important to recognize that these factors may aggravate the clinical response to this promising therapy, even in patient successful recanalization was attained.
