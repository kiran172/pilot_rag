Title: The novel bio-SYNTAX scoring system for predicting the prognosis of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention with left main coronary artery disease.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Simple and effective risk models incorporating biomarkers associated with left main coronary artery (LMCA) stenosis are limited. This study aimed to validate the novel Bio-Clinical SYNTAX score (Bio-CSS) incorporating N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with LMCA stenosis.
METHODS: Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for LMCA stenosis using a drug-eluting stent (n = 275) were included in the study. We developed the Bio-CSS incorporating NT-proBNP and validated the ability of the Bio-CSS to predict major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) and compared its performance to that of the SYNTAX score (SS) and SS II. The MACEs were defined as death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), and repeat revascularizations.
RESULTS: The Bio-CSS (34.7 ± 18.3 vs. 51.9 ± 28.4, p &lt; 0.001), as well as SS (23.6 ± 7.3 vs. 26.7 ± 8.1, p = 0.003) and SS II (29.4 ± 9.9 vs. 36.1 ± 12.8, p &lt; 0.001), was significantly higher in patients with MACEs. In the Cox proportional hazards model, the log Bio-CSS (hazard ratio 8.31, 95% CI 1.84-37.55) was an independent prognostic factor for MACEs after adjusting for confounding variables. In the receiver operating characteristic curves, the area under the curve of the Bio-CSS was significantly higher compared to those of SS (0.608 vs. 0.706, p = 0.001) and SS II (0.655 vs. 0.706, p = 0.026). Patients were categorized into the three groups based on the tertiles of the Bio-CSS. Patients in the highest tertile of the Bio-CSS had significantly higher MACEs compared to those in the lower two tertiles (log-rank p &lt; 0.001).
CONCLUSION: In patients who underwent PCI for LMCA stenosis, the novel Bio-CSS improved the discrimination accuracy of established combined scores, such as SS and SS II. The addition of NT-proBNP to the clinical and angiographic findings in the Bio-CSS could potentially provide useful long-term prognostic information in these patients.
