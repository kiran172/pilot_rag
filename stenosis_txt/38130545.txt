Title: Successful Heart Transplantation With Myocardial Bridging: A Case Report on Unroofing Technique.

Abstract: Myocardial bridging (MB), a common anatomical variation where a segment of a coronary artery is covered by myocardium, poses a relative contraindication in heart transplantation due to the risk of post-transplant ischemia. This report presents a case of successful transplantation of a donor heart with MB, where unroofing (removal) of the myocardial bridge was performed. The donor was a 42-year-old male with mild nonobstructive coronary artery stenosis and MB. The recipient, a 55-year-old male, suffered from ischemic cardiomyopathy and severe heart failure. During transplantation, unroofing of the donor heart's MB was executed to mitigate the risk of myocardial ischemia. The transplantation was successful with preserved postoperative cardiac function. The unroofing procedure did not significantly extend ischemic or operative time. Postoperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiography showed no signs of myocardial ischemia. Donor hearts with MB can be utilized for transplantation with appropriate surgical intervention. This case demonstrates the potential of unroofing procedures in expanding the suitability of donor hearts for transplantation, without increasing the risk of postoperative complications or mortality.
