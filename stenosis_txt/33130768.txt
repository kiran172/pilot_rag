Title: [Congenital Heart Surgery in Patients with Coexisting Congenital Anomalies of Respiratory or Digestive System].

Abstract: Congenital anomaly of respiratory or digestive system have a significant impact on the perioperative management of congenital heart disease. Therefore, it is important to make a long-term treatment strategy. It has been reported that 1-stage surgery is effective for pulmonary artery sling. Simultaneous repair is also useful if significant airway stenosis is present prior to cardiac surgery. In the case of congenital heart disease associated with gastrointestinal anomaly, gastrointestinal surgery precedes in more than 80% of cases. In recent years, though treatments of gastrointestinal atresia have a good outcome, the results of esophageal atresia are still bad. If we choice multi-stage surgery, there is a possibility that we cannot perform cardiac surgery at appropriate time due to postoperative mediastinitis. Therefore, we must consider the timing and method of operation individually. The important thing is to keep a good relationships with related departments and to provide close informed consent to the patient's parents.
