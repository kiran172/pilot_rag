Title: Emergency department presentations and associated hospital admissions for low back pain in Australia.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To determine factors associated with hospital admissions from ED presentations for low back pain (LBP).
METHODS: This was a retrospective analysis of 147 ED centres in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, between 2005 and 2014. Data were accessed from the NSW Emergency Department Data Collection to determine patients who attended ED and whether or not they were admitted to hospital.
RESULTS: There were 1 388 078 ED visits for LBP across 147 different ED centres between 2005 and 2014. Between 2005 and 2013, hospital admission rates from ED visits for LBP increased annually by 5.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.9-6.4) from 477 per 100 000 in 2005 to 730 per 100 000 in 2013. Patients who were under injured workers' insurance (i.e. workers compensation insurance) had significantly lower odds (odds ratio [OR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.40-0.43) of being admitted to hospital for LBP compared with those not on injured workers' insurance. Patients living in the highest socioeconomic areas were also more likely to be admitted to hospital from an ED visit, compared with those from the lowest socioeconomic areas (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.24-1.29).
CONCLUSION: Rates of hospitalisation following attendance to ED for LBP increased annually by 5% between 2005 and 2013. Hospital admission rates were lower among patients from the lowest socioeconomic areas or under injured workers' compensation insurance.
