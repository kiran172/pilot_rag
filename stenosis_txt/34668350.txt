Title: CT Fractional Flow Reserve for the Diagnosis of Myocardial Bridging-Related Ischemia: A Study Using Dynamic CT Myocardial Perfusion Imaging as a Reference Standard.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To investigate the diagnostic performance of CT fractional flow reserve (CT-FFR) for myocardial bridging-related ischemia using dynamic CT myocardial perfusion imaging (CT-MPI) as a reference standard.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dynamic CT-MPI and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) data obtained from 498 symptomatic patients were retrospectively reviewed. Seventy-five patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 62.7 ± 13.2 years; 48 males) who showed myocardial bridging in the left anterior descending artery without concomitant obstructive stenosis on the imaging were included. The change in CT-FFR across myocardial bridging (ΔCT-FFR, defined as the difference in CT-FFR values between the proximal and distal ends of the myocardial bridging) in different cardiac phases, as well as other anatomical parameters, were measured to evaluate their performance for diagnosing myocardial bridging-related myocardial ischemia using dynamic CT-MPI as the reference standard (myocardial blood flow < 100 mL/100 mL/min or myocardial blood flow ratio ≤ 0.8).
RESULTS: ΔCT-FFR<sub>systolic</sub> (ΔCT-FFR calculated in the best systolic phase) was higher in patients with vs. without myocardial bridging-related myocardial ischemia (median [interquartile range], 0.12 [0.08-0.17] vs. 0.04 [0.01-0.07], p &lt; 0.001), while CT-FFR<sub>systolic</sub> (CT-FFR distal to the myocardial bridging calculated in the best systolic phase) was lower (0.85 [0.81-0.89] vs. 0.91 [0.88-0.96], p = 0.043). In contrast, ΔCT-FFR<sub>diastolic</sub> (ΔCT-FFR calculated in the best diastolic phase) and CT-FFR<sub>diastolic</sub> (CT-FFR distal to the myocardial bridging calculated in the best diastolic phase) did not differ significantly. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that ΔCT-FFR<sub>systolic</sub> had largest area under the curve (0.822; 95% confidence interval, 0.717-0.901) for identifying myocardial bridging-related ischemia. ΔCT-FFR<sub>systolic</sub> had the highest sensitivity (91.7%) and negative predictive value (NPV) (97.8%). ΔCT-FFR<sub>diastolic</sub> had the highest specificity (85.7%) for diagnosing myocardial bridging-related ischemia. The positive predictive values of all CT-related parameters were low.
CONCLUSION: ΔCT-FFR<sub>systolic</sub> reliably excluded myocardial bridging-related ischemia with high sensitivity and NPV. Myocardial bridging showing positive CT-FFR results requires further evaluation.
