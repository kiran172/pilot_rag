Title: Ayurvedic approach to treat Hridroga (valvular heart disease): A case report.

Abstract: Kabhatika Hridroga (valvular heart disease) embodies a significant part of cardiovascular disease. There are many causes for valvular heart disease of which, the rheumatic fever is an important one. This study is a case report of a patient awaiting mitral valve transplant for valvular heart disease (i.e., mitral stenosis attributed to rheumatic fever), who responded well to Ayurvedic management. After 11 months of treatment, 3D cardiovascular cartography showed increase in mitral valve area from 1.3 sq cm to 3.52 sq cm (normal size is 4-6 sq cm). The present case report showed that Ayurveda has a great potential for the treatment of valvular heart disease and merits further research.
