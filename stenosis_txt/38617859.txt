Title: [Assessment of Coronary Stenosis Using Coronary CT Angiography in Patients with High Calcium Scores: Current Limitations and Future Perspectives].

Abstract: Coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is recognized for its role as a gatekeeper for invasive coronary angiography in patients suspected of coronary artery disease because it can detect significant coronary stenosis with high accuracy. However, heavy plaque in the coronary artery makes it difficult to visualize the lumen, which can lead to errors in the interpretation of the CCTA results. This is primarily due to the limited spatial resolution of CT scanners, resulting in blooming artifacts caused by calcium. However, coronary stenosis with high calcium scores often requires evaluation using CCTA. Technological methods to overcome these limitations include the introduction of high-resolution CT scanners, the development of reconstruction techniques, and the subtraction technique. Methods to improve reading ability, such as the setting of appropriate window width and height, and evaluation of the position of calcified plaque and residual visibility of the lumen in cross-sectional images, are also recommended.
