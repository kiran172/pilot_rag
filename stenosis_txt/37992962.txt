Title: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement: Long-term variables significantly associated with mortality and morbidity.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In aortic root surgery, valve-sparing aortic root replacement is an attractive alternative by mitigating the risks inherent to prosthetic valves; however, little is known about the variables that impact its durability. We review our mid- to long-term outcomes after valve-sparing aortic root replacement and describe factors that impact survival and valve reintervention and insufficiency.
METHODS: A retrospective review of 284 consecutive patients undergoing valve-sparing aortic root replacement between November 1999 and January 2022 at Austin Health, Melbourne, Australia, was undertaken, with a median follow-up of 6.43 ± 4.83 years, but up to 22.0 years. Freedom from mortality, aortic reintervention, and insufficiency was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier methods, Cox proportional hazard models, and Fine-Gray analysis.
RESULTS: The median age of patients at intervention was 60.0 years (interquartile range, 48.0-67.0), of whom 68 (23.9%) had bicuspid aortic valve disease, 27 (9.5%) had Marfan syndrome, 119 (41.9%) had severe aortic root dilation (>50 mm), and 155 had (54.6%) severe aortic insufficiency at the time of intervention. The 30-day mortality was 1.8%, with freedom from mortality of 96.0% (95% CI, 92.6-97.8) at 5 years and 88.2% (95% CI, 81.4-92.6) at 10 years. Freedom from aortic reintervention was 92.2% (95% CI, 87.7-95.2) at 5 years and 79.8% (95% CI, 71.8-85.8) at 10 years. Factors associated with reintervention were concomitant leaflet repair (hazard ratio, 8.13, 95% CI, 1.07-61.7) and bicuspid valvulopathy (hazard ratio, 2.23, 95% CI, 1.07-4.68), with reintervention in the bicuspid aortic valve being more likely due to aortic stenosis and in the tricuspid aortic valve due to aortic insufficiency (chi-square P = .05). The freedom from aortic insufficiency was 89.1% (95% CI, 83.5-92.9), 84.9% (95% CI, 77.8-89.9) at 5 and 10 years, respectively, and 80.7% (95% CI, 71.0-87.4).
CONCLUSIONS: Valve-sparing aortic root replacement has excellent long-term outcomes, with low mortality and reintervention rates. Concomitant leaflet repair and bicuspid valve disease are the only long-term factors associated with reintervention.
