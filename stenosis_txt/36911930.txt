Title: Effectiveness of non-surgical treatment combined with supervised exercise for lumbar spinal stenosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The benefits of combining supervised exercise in the non-surgical treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of non-surgical treatments with and without supervised exercise for pain intensity, symptom severity, functional impairment/disability, walking distance, and quality of life (QOL) in LSS patients.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating combinations of supervised exercises were searched using four electronic databases up to August 13, 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted for immediate and long-term results.
RESULTS: Three studies were identified, including 244 participants. Immediate-term results showed that leg pain intensity (mean distance [MD]: -0.94, 95% confidence intervals [95% CI]: -1.60 to -0.29, p< 0.01) and symptom severity (MD: -0.29, 95% CI: -0.50 to -0.08, p< 0.01) were lower in the study group than in the control group, and walking distance (MD: 415.83, 95% CI: 298.15 to 533.50, p< 0.001) and QOL were higher in the study group. Long-term results showed that functional disability/impairment (MD: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.49 to -0.04, p< 0.05) was lower in the study group than in the control group, and walking distance and QOL were higher in the study group.
CONCLUSION: The number of studies on this topic was small and limited. Combinations of non-surgical treatment and supervised exercise may not provide significant benefits.
