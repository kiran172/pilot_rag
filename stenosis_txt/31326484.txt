Title: Changes in Myocardial Native T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> After Exercise Stress: A Noncontrast CMR Pilot Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study assessed changes in myocardial native T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> values after supine exercise stress in healthy subjects and in patients with suspected ischemia as potential imaging markers of ischemia.
BACKGROUND: With emerging data on the long-term retention of gadolinium in the body and brain, there is a need for an alternative noncontrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)-based myocardial ischemia assessment.
METHODS: Twenty-eight healthy adult subjects and 14 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) referred for exercise stress and/or rest single-photon emission computed tomography/myocardial perfusion imaging (SPECT/MPI) for evaluation of chest pain were prospectively enrolled. Free-breathing myocardial native T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> mapping were performed before and after supine bicycle exercise stress using a CMR-compatible supine ergometer positioned on the MR table. Differences in T<sub>1 rest</sub>, T<sub>2 rest</sub> and T<sub>1 post-exercise</sub>, T<sub>2 post-exercise</sub> values were calculated as T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> reactivity, respectively.
RESULTS: The mean exercise intensity was 104 W, with exercise duration of 6 to 12 min. After exercise, native T<sub>1</sub> was increased in healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.001). T<sub>1</sub> reactivity, but not T<sub>2</sub> reactivity, correlated with the rate-pressure product as the index of myocardial blood flow during exercise (r = 0.62; p &lt; 0.001). In patients with CAD, T<sub>1</sub> reactivity was associated with the severity of myocardial perfusion abnormality on SPECT/MPI (normal: 4.9%; quartiles: 3.7% to 6.3%, mild defect: 1.2%, quartiles: 0.08% to 2.5%; moderate defect: 0.45%, quartiles: -0.35% to 1.4%; severe defect: 0.35%, quartiles: -0.44% to 0.8%) and had similar potential as SPECT/MPI to detect significant CAD (&gt;50% diameter stenosis on coronary angiography). The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve was 0.80 versus 0.72 (p = 0.40). The optimum cutoff value of T<sub>1</sub> reactivity for predicting flow-limiting stenosis was 2.5%, with a sensitivity of 83% and a specificity of 92%, a negative predictive value of 96%, a positive predictive value of 71%, and an area under the curve of 0.86.
CONCLUSIONS: Free-breathing stress/rest native T<sub>1</sub> mapping, but not T<sub>2</sub> mapping, can detect physiological changes in the myocardium during exercise. Our feasibility study in patients shows the potential of this technique as a method for detecting myocardial ischemia in patients with CAD without using a pharmacological stress agent.
