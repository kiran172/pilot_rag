Title: Investigation of the Predictive Values of Triglyceride/HDL Cholesterol Ratio and Whole Blood Viscosity with Regard to Severe Peripheral or Carotid Artery Disease in Patients Scheduled for Coronary Bypass.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, which constitute an important disease group, is expected to rise with increasing life expectancy. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive values of triglyceride/HDL cholesterol (TG/HDL-C) ratio and whole blood viscosity on possible severe carotid or peripheral arterial disease in patients who were admitted to our clinic and scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery.
METHODS: This study retrospectively examined 299 patients who were admitted to our clinic and scheduled for CABG between August 1, 2015, and August 1, 2019. Patients with severe carotid or peripheral arterial disease were included in group 2; those in whom peripheral arterial disease and stenosis were not detected were included in group 1.
RESULTS: Group 1 consisted of 255 patients, mean (± standard deviation) age 58.1 ± 8.9 years; the 44 patients in group 2 had a mean age of 64.1 ± 10.6 years (P = .018). The incidence of diabetes mellitus and tobacco use were significantly higher in group 2 (P < .001 and P = .034, respectively). Triglyceride values, TG/HDL-C, and whole blood viscosity at high and low shear rates were significantly higher in group 2 (P = .017, P < .001, P < .001, and P < .001, respectively). Receiver operator characteristic analysis revealed that the cutoff value of TG/HDL-C was 3.2 with 77% sensitivity and 72% specificity; that of high-shear-rate viscosity was 16.1 with 73% sensitivity and 69% specificity; and that of low-shear-rate viscosity was 59.2 with 70% sensitivity and 63% specificity.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to predict severe additional arterial diseases in patients scheduled for CABG with whole blood viscosity and TG/HDL-C ratios, both of which can be obtained with simple blood tests.
