Title: Difficulties to enter the left ventricle during percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC)- our experiences of 80 cases with modified techniques.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Percutaneous transvenous mitral commissurotomy (PTMC) is the standard of treatment for symptomatic severe rheumatic mitral stenosis (MS). PTMC has the standard Inoue technique, but we have to modify the procedure in many technically challenging cases, especially to cross the mitral valve.
METHODOLOGY: Two over-the-wire strategies to enter the LV were taken in 80 complex cases of PTMC. The first one was done by exchanging the J-shaped wire from the balloon, introducing the spring wire into it, and pushing it into LV. The second one-removal of balloon keeping the spring wire in LA and the Mullin's sheath was introduced, and the tip of the wire was pushed into LV, and the balloon was introduced over the wire. We also changed the left atrium (LA) graphy in the RAO view instead of the AP view to facilitating entry into LV.
RESULTS: We succeeded in 76 (95 %) cases. Strategy one was applied to all but successful in only 25 cases (31 %), and strategy 2 was applied in the remaining. Strategy 1 required less procedural time and fluoroscopic time in comparison to strategy 2 (40 ± 10 vs 60 ± 16 min, 25 ± 7 vs 35 ± 8 min). After modification of taking the LA graphy in RAO view, our rate of facing the difficulties decreased from 21 % to 9 %. Critical MS (31 %) and the giant LA (30 %) were the topmost causes of difficulties. No major complications were recorded.
CONCLUSION: Over-the-wire entry into LV is cost-effective, requiring no new equipment and is safe and can be used in complex cases.
