Title: Brachiocephalic artery aneurysm plaque rupture, stroke & repair.

Abstract: A 70 year old left-handed man presented to his general practitioner with abnormal left arm movements, left hemianopia and loss of balance. He was found to have an isolated brachiocephalic artery aneurysm, measuring 3.5 cm, with associated plaque rupture, contributing to recurrent episodes of transient ischemic attack. He was discussed extensively by a multidisciplinary team. e concurrently had complete occlusion of the right internal carotid artery with distal reconstitution in its supraclinoid segment from collaterals. Stenting of the region would necessitate inappropriately covering the right vertebral artery which would further compromise intracerebral blood. Surgical intervention was deemed the only safe option and he was thus accepted for cardiothoracic surgery. Standard workup revealed left anterior descending artery stenosis. He underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, left atrial appendectomy and brachiocephalic artery resection with replacement with a interposition graft with 10 mm polytetrafluoroethylene graft. He recovered well. This case demonstrates the multi-disciplinary decision making in a rare cause of embolic stroke.
