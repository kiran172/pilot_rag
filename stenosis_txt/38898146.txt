Title: The Utility of Sirolimus Eluting Balloons in the Setting of Chronic Limb Threatening Ischaemia in Asian Patients from Singapore - 12 Months Results of the PRISTINE Registry.

Abstract: PURPOSE: The aim of PRISTINE was to evaluate the 6 and 12 months safety and efficacy of the Selution Sustained Limus Release (SLR)™ sirolimus-coated balloon for treatment of complex lower limb occlusive lesions (TASC II C & D) in patients with chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI) from Singapore.
METHODS: PRISTINE was a prospective, non-randomized, single arm, observational, multi-investigator, single-center clinical study. Complication-free survival at 30 days was the safety clinical endpoint. Immediate technical success (ability to cross and dilate the lesion and achieve residual angiographic stenosis < 30%), 6-month primary vessel patency, limb salvage, clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) and amputation free survival (AFS) were the efficacy endpoints of interest.
RESULTS: Seventy five patients were included. There were 50 (68.0%) males; mean age, 69.0 ± 10.7 years. CLTI severity was based on the Rutherford Scale (R5 = 51; R6 = 17). Significant co-morbidities included diabetes mellitus (n = 68; 91.0%) and end-stage renal failure (n = 28; 37.0%). 112 atherosclerotic lesions were treated (TASC II D = 58 (52%); 76 (67%) de novo). There was 100% technical success. Mean lesion length treated was 22.4 ± 13.9 cm. Primary vessel patencies at 6 and 12 months were 64/86 (74%) and 43/74 (58%) and freedom from clinically driven TLR were 72/86 (84%) and 55/74 (74%) respectively. AFS was 61/73 (84.0%; five deaths and seven major lower extremity amputation) at 6-months. Mean Rutherford score improved from 5.1 ± 0.55 at baseline to 1.1 ± 2.05 (p < 0.05) at one year and there was a wound healing rate of 38/48 (79%) at the same timepoint.
CONCLUSIONS: The Selution SLR™ drug eluting balloon is safe and efficacious in treating highly complex infra-inguinal atherosclerotic lesions in an otherwise challenging frail population of CLTI patients with a high incidence of diabetes and end-stage renal failure. It is associated with highly satisfactory acute technical and clinical success, 12-month target lesion patency and AFS.
