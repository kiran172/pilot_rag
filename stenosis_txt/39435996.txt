Title: Polymer Everolimus-Eluting Stent as Bailout Stenting for Below-the-Knee Artery Repair in Patients with Critical Limb-Threatening Ischemia: A Real-World National Registry.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Percutaneous old balloon angioplasty is still the preferred treatment for the treatment of below-the-knee (BTK) arteries in chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). In the case of a suboptimal angioplasty result, a bailout stenting is required. So far, few data are available to assess the outcomes of bailout stenting after BTK angioplasty. This study aims to investigate the 1-year efficacy and safety after implantation of a polymer everolimus-eluting stent (PEES) as bailout stenting for BTK repair in patients with CLTI in a real-world setting.
DESIGN: This was a national multicenter prospective observational study.
METHODS: Patients with CLTI (Rutherford 4 to 6) BTK lesions (including P3) and requiring a bailout PEES due to dissection, thrombosis, or residual stenosis ≥30% after angioplasty were included. The freedom of a major adverse limb event at 12 months of the target limb was the primary endpoint.
RESULTS: XIENCE assessed 106 limbs (CLTI, 96.2%; chronic total occlusion, 2.8%) in 106 patients (mean age 77.1 years; males, 71.7%; diabetes mellitus, 66.9%; chronic kidney failure, 36.8%) with CLTI undergoing PEES stenting as a bailout for BTK lesions. Bailout stenting was required after 75.5% and 26.4% of residual stenosis and dissection, respectively. The mean diameter and length of the PEES were 3 mm and 3.4 ± 0.5 cm, respectively. At 1 year, the freedom of a major adverse limb event was 79.6% (95% CI, 71.5%-88.7%), the major amputation rate was 6.2% (95% CI, 1.3%-11%), and the target revascularization rate was 14.9% (95% CI, 6.5%-22.5%).
CONCLUSIONS: In CLTI patients with BTK lesions, PEES stenting showed safety and efficacy as bailout stenting for BTK arterial lesions. This confirms the need for PEES stenting in a real-world practice.
CLINICAL IMPACT: The XIENCE study introduces the PEES as an effective bailout stenting option for patients with CLTI undergoing BTK revascularization, particularly for lesions under 4 cm. The study focuses on real-world cases where POBA alone is insufficient, demonstrating that PEES significantly improves outcomes by enhancing limb salvage and reducing the need for major amputations. For clinicians, this innovation offers a precise, size-adaptable solution, especially in cases where bailout stenting is required for short, focal lesions, improving both clinical and procedural results.
