Title: Surgical Repair of Peripheral Pulmonary Artery Stenosis in Patients Without Williams or Alagille Syndromes.

Abstract: Peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis is a relatively rare form of congenital heart disease typically associated with genetic syndromes, such as Williams or Alagille syndromes. However, some patients present with severe stenosis without associated syndromes. The purpose of the study was to review our surgical experience in such patients. This was a retrospective review of 30 patients who underwent surgical repair for peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis. Concomitant anatomical diagnoses in 20 patients (67%) included supravalvar aortic stenosis (n = 8), tetralogy of Fallot (n = 4), d-transposition of the great arteries (n = 2), truncus arteriosus (n = 2), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (n = 2), ventricular septal defect (n = 1), and patent ductus arteriosus (n = 1). Additional medical diagnoses in 15 patients (50%) included elastin arteriopathy (n = 9), pulmonary artery calcinosis (n = 1), arterial tortuosity syndrome (n = 1), DiGeorge syndrome (n = 1), and Noonan syndrome (n = 1). Median age at surgery was 3.6 years (interquartile range 1.6-7.4 years). Seventeen patients (57%) had prior cardiac operations, and 16 patients (53%) previously underwent percutaneous intervention. With surgery, mean right ventricle-to-aortic systolic pressure ratio decreased from 0.95 ± 0.2 to 0.28 ± 0.08 (P< 0.0001). Median duration of cardiopulmonary bypass was 369 minutes. There was 100% survival to hospital discharge, with no mortality at mean follow-up of 2.3 years. No patient required reoperation, while 4 underwent balloon dilation. Freedom from pulmonary artery catheter-based reintervention was 95% and 80% at 12 and 36 months, respectively. Patients with peripheral pulmonary artery stenosis without either Williams or Alagille syndrome can successfully undergo surgical repair with a significant reduction in right ventricle-to-aortic pressure ratios.
