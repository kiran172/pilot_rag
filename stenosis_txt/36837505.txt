Title: Unilateral Biportal Endoscopic Laminectomy for Treating Cervical Stenosis: A Technical Note and Preliminary Results.

Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study was to introduce a surgical technique for the percutaneous decompression of cervical stenosis (CS) using a unilateral biportal endoscopic approach and characterize its early clinical and radiographic results. Materials and Methods: Nineteen consecutive patients with CS who needed surgical intervention were recruited. All enrolled patients underwent unilateral biportal endoscopic laminectomy (UBEL). All patients were followed postoperatively for &gt;1 year. The preoperative and final follow-up evaluations included the Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score for neurological assessment, visual analogue scale (VAS) for axial pain and C2-C7 Cobb angle for cervical sagittal alignment. The postoperative complications were analyzed. Results: Thirteen males and six females were included in the analysis. The mean follow-up period was 16.3 ± 2.6 months. The mean operative time was 82.6 ± 18.4 min. Postoperative MRI and CT revealed ideal neural decompression of the treated segments in all patients. Preoperative VAS and JOA scores improved significantly after the surgery, and cervical lordosis was preserved on the postoperative images. Conclusions: UBEL was an effective surgical method for CS, which may also minimize iatrogenic damage to the posterior tension band (PTB) and help to maximize the preservation of the cervical lordosis.
