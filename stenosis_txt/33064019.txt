Title: Lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio in predicting the calcific aortic valve stenosis in a Chinese case-control study.

Abstract: Aim: This study examined the role of lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), an inflammatory biomarker, in predicting the severity of calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS) in a Chinese case-control study. Results: The LMR significantly decreased in the patients with CAVS compared with healthy controls. An inverse correlation was observed between the severity of stenosis and LMR in the patients. Additionally, the LMR was identified in the multivariate analysis as an independent predictor of severe CAVS. Conclusion: This study provides evidence of an inverse correlation between the severity of CAVS and LMR. LMR could potentially be applied as an independent predictor of severe CAVS and could be incorporated into a novel predictive model.
