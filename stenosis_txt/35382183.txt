Title: The CHA2DS2-VASc Score as an Early Predictor of Graft Failure After Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery.

Abstract: Background and objective Graft patency is one of the major concerns after coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. The CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc [congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥75 years, diabetes mellitus (DM), stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), vascular disease, age 65 to 74 years, sex category] score is a tool that was developed to predict the risk of thrombotic events in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). In this study, we evaluated the use of the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score as a simple tool for predicting graft failure (GF) among patients who underwent CABG surgery. Methods In this retrospective case-control study, a total of 280 patients were enrolled after applying the exclusion criteria. Angiograms were analyzed by using the QCA software system (Pie Medical Imaging, Maastricht, The Netherlands) for each patient. A graft was described as failed if it had 70% or more stenosis or was completely occluded. Patients were classified into two groups: group one included patients without GF (GF-N) and group two included patients with GF (GF-Y). Thereafter, the CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc risk score was calculated for each patient. Results In our cohort, 136 patients had GF (GF-Y group) and 144 patients did not have GF (GF-N group). GF-N and GF-Y patients had their angiography performed 100.31 ± 8.04 and 103.49 ± 8.41 months after CABG, respectively. GF-Y group had a significantly higher rate of DM, hypertension, and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). GF-Y group had higher CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2 </sub>(GF-N group: 1.47 ± 0.91 vs. GF-Y group: 2.57 ± 1.17, p=0.0001) and CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score (GF-N group: 2.80 ± 1.11 vs. GF-Y group: 4.15 ± 1.25, p=0.0001). Analyses showed that only CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc was an independent predictor of GF while other parameters including DM, hypertension, HFrEF, creatinine, and CHADS<sub>2</sub> were not found to be independent predictors of GF. A CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score of &gt;3 predicted GF with a sensitivity of 65.44% and a specificity of 74.31%. Conclusions The CHA<sub>2</sub>DS<sub>2</sub>-VASc score might be used as a feasible and simple method to predict the risk of GF after CABG surgery.
