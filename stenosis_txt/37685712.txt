Title: TAVI after More Than 20 Years.

Abstract: It has been more than 20 years since the first in man transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI), and during this period we have witnessed an impressive evolution of this technique, with an extension of its use from non-operable patients to high-, intermediate- and even low-risk patients with aortic stenosis, and with a decrease in the incidence of complications. In this review, we discuss the evaluation of patients before TAVI, the procedure and the changes it has seen over time, and we present the current main complications and challenges of TAVI.
