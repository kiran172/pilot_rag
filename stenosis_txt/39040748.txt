Title: An Unusual Relation in an Infant With Left Hemitruncus and Tetralogy of Fallot Along With Pulmonary Valve Syndrome: A Case Report.

Abstract: The abnormalÂ origin of the left pulmonary artery (LPA) from the ascending aorta is a rare cardiac condition that is often associated with several other congenital defects. In this paper, we report the case of an infant who presented with recurrent infections and was prenatally diagnosed with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). During echocardiography, various other cardiac defects such as ventricular septal defects (VSD), pulmonary stenosis (PS), and dilated right heart chambers were identified. Furthermore, cardiac catheterization revealed an anomalous origin of the LPA arising from the aorta associated with a narrow pulmonary annulus. Due to both conditions sharing a similar embryological course, the condition is commonly associated with a conotruncal defect known as DiGeorge syndrome. Together, the overall combination of cardiac anomalies is both unusual and unique. This case study explains the clinical associations, embryological origin, and surgical management of this condition in an infant.
