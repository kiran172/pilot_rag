Title: Prognostic Factors for Acute Transjugular Intrahepatic Portosystemic Shunt Occlusion Using Expanded Polytetrafluoroethylene-Covered Stent.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stent has been widely used in the transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) procedure. However, the epidemiologic data of acute TIPS occlusion (ATO) and the underlying mechanisms are scarce.
AIMS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and prognostic factors for ATO within 1 week in TIPS recipients using ePTFE-covered stents.
METHODS: We identified 222 patients who underwent ePTFE-covered TIPS creation for complications of portal hypertension between June 2015 and June 2017 at a large tertiary center. Medical records and TIPS procedure data were retrospectively reviewed, and the influence of these variables on ATO was assessed by multivariate logistic regression analysis.
RESULTS: TIPS technical success was achieved in 219 patients (98.6%). Two patients were excluded due to missing data, leaving 217 patients for final analysis. ATO occurred in nine patients (4.1%). Blood flow was restored by balloon angioplasty (n = 4), additional stent insertion (n = 4), and parallel TIPS (n = 1). In multivariable logistic regression, intrastent stenosis (HR 43.871; 95% CI 3.816, 504.373; P = 0.002), previous splenectomy (HR 26.843; 95% CI 2.106, 342.124; P = 0.011), and stent shortening in the hepatic vein (HR 11.54; 95% CI 1.021, 130.416; P = 0.048) were demonstrated as independent significant risk factors for ATO.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the intrastent stenosis, previous splenectomy, and stent shortening in the hepatic vein are vital prognostic factors for ATO in TIPS recipients. Individualized post-TIPS management strategy was required.
