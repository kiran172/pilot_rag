Title: Comparative Outcomes of Supera Interwoven Nitinol vs Bare Nitinol Stents for the Treatment of Femoropopliteal Disease: Insights From the XLPAD Registry.

Abstract: Purpose: To report a propensity score analysis comparing outcomes of the Supera interwoven nitinol stent to bare nitinol stents (BNS) in the femoropopliteal segment. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted utilizing data extracted from the Excellence in Peripheral Artery Disease (XLPAD) registry (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01904851) on 871 patients (mean age 65.1 years; 713 men) who underwent femoropopliteal balloon angioplasty with either Supera stent implantation in 118 limbs or other contemporary BNS in 753 limbs between January 2006 and December 2016. All patients in both groups were matched for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics in a 1:1 propensity score matching using the nearest neighbor method to create the 118-patient matched BNS cohort. One-year outcomes included all-cause mortality, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and target limb revascularization (TLR). An additional core laboratory analysis was conducted to measure the deployed length of Supera stents. Results: In unmatched data, the Supera stent group had a numerically lower rate of TVR (7.6% vs 13.4%, p=0.08) and a significantly lower 1-year TLR rate (7.6% vs 16.2%, p=0.02) compared to the BNS group. Both groups had similar 1-year mortality (2.5% vs 2.7%, p=0.9). Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that the Supera group had a significantly lower risk of TVR (p=0.02) and TLR (p=0.002) than the BNS group. After propensity matching, the 1-year TVR estimate was lower for Supera stents (7.6% vs 12.7%, p=0.08) and significantly lower for TLR (7.6% vs 13.6%, p=0.04) than the BNS group. There was no statistically significant association between Supera stent elongation (&gt;10% of the labeled stent length) and 1-year risk of TLR (p=0.6). Conclusion: Supera stent usage in femoropopliteal intervention was associated with reduced risk of 1-year repeat target limb revascularization compared with BNS treatment in both unmatched and matched cohorts.
