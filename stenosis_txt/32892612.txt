Title: Comparison between endovascular versus hybrid thrombectomy for arteriovenous graft under complete ultrasound guidance.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Endovascular treatment of acute thrombosed arteriovenous grafts performed completely under ultrasound guidance has rarely been reported. We compared the efficacy of a new endovascular thrombectomy technique (percutaneous manual thromboaspiration through the introducer sheath) with classical hybrid thrombectomy (minimally invasive surgical thrombectomy combined with high-pressure angioplasty) performed completely under ultrasound guidance, for arteriovenous graft thrombosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study involving patients receiving hemodialysis who underwent arteriovenous graft thrombectomy between January 2014 and December 2017. We divided 130 participants into an intervention (endovascular) group (N.=65) and a control (classical hybrid) group (N.=65) according to the thrombectomy technique. The procedural success rate, immediate outcomes and patency were compared between the groups.
RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the procedural success rate (92.31% vs. 89.23%, P=0.55) between the intervention and control groups, respectively. No major complications were noted, but two cases of vessel rupture occurred in the control group and three cases of vessel rupture occurred in the intervention group. The procedure time in the intervention group was significantly shorter than that in the control group (74±14.21 min vs. 109.05±19.20 min, respectively; P<0.05). During the 6-month follow-up, we found no significant difference in the postintervention primary patency rate (48.33% vs. 55.17%; P=0.51) or the postintervention second patency rate (83.33% vs. 84.49%; P=0.79) between the intervention and control groups, respectively. Dialysis clearance and ≥50% stenosis were predictors of postintervention primary patency (hazard ratio, 7.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.75-34.81; P=0.01; and hazard ratio, 6.43; 95% confidence interval: 2.43-17.03; P<0.001), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: Completely ultrasound-guided percutaneous manual thromboaspiration through the introducer sheath can be used for thrombosed arteriovenous grafts. This approach has the advantage of shorter operative time compared with hybrid treatment.
