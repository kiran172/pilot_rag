Title: Osteoblastoma of Talus: A Diagnostic Dilemma.

Abstract: The critical biomechanical importance of talus and nonspecific clinical features of talus lesion warrants a meticulous diagnostic work-up for specific management, particularly when the talus lesion is associated with concomitant soft tissue and joint abnormalities. We present a rare case of osteoblastoma of talus with concomitant tenosynovitis of tibialis anterior, ankle joint effusion, varicose vein and moderate distal arterial stenosis.
