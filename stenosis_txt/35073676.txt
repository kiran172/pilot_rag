Title: [Analysis of the efficacy and safety of low-dose aspirin in preventing renal artery stenosis in kidney transplantation].

Abstract: Objective: To evaluate the clinical value of aspirin as a prophylactic for transplant renal artery stenosis (TRAS). Methods: From January 2017 to November 2019, clinical data of 307 patients who had undergone renal transplant in Zhengzhou University People's Hospital were collected. Patients were divided into two groups: the treatment group (124 recipients who had taken oral aspirin 100 mg/d after transplant) and the control group (183 recipients who had not taken aspirin after transplant). The general data, incidence of initially diagnosed and confirmed TRAS, type of renal artery anastomosis vessels, duration of stenosis, location of stenosis, and complications were compared between the two groups. The treatment group was further divided into two subgroups, the early group (92 recipients) and the delayed group (32 recipients), according to the time of starting aspirin after operation. Subgroup analysis was performed. Results: Among all 307 patients included, there were 241 males and 66 females, aged 19-64 years. There were no statistical difference between the treatment and control groups in terms of gender, age, comorbidities, number of arterial vessels, type of graft, and acute rejection all P&gt;0.05. Among 46 initially diagnosed TRAS patients, 13 (10.5%) and 33 (18.0%) cases were in the treatment and control group respectively, with no statistically significant difference in stenosis rate (P&gt;0.05). The number of confirmed TRAS patients was 1 (0.8%) and 24 (13.1%) in the treatment and control group respectively, with statistically significant difference in stenosis rate (P&lt;0.001). The proportion of patients with bleeding disorders in the treatment group was slightly higher than that in the control group (13.7% vs 8.7%), and the proportion of infarct diseases was slightly lower than that in the control group (1.6% vs 4.9%). But there was no significant difference in aspirin-related complications between the two groups (P&gt;0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that there was no significant difference in initially diagnosed and confirmed TRAS and aspirin-related complications between the early group and the delayed group (all P&gt;0.05). Conclusions: Oral low-dose aspirin after kidney transplantation can effectively reduce the incidence of TRAS, without increasing the risk of aspirin-related complications.
