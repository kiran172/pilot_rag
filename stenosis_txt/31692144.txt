Title: Early and midterm results of minimally invasive aortic and mitral valve surgery via right mini-thoracotomy.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: There are few reports regarding minimally invasive aortic valve replacement concomitant with mitral valve surgery (MIAMVS). The aim of this study was to evaluate early and midterm MIAMVS results.
METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of 21 consecutive patients (nine females, 43%) who underwent MIAMVS through a right mini-thoracotomy from December 2014 to April 2017. Mean patient age was 73 ± 7.4 years and four (19%) were New York Heart Association Class III or IV. Aortic stenosis and mitral valve insufficiency were the most common pathologies. All patients were followed for a mean period of 30 ± 8.5 months.
RESULTS: The types of surgery consisted of aortic valve replacement with mitral valve repair in 11 (52%) patients, and replacement of both aortic and mitral valves in 10 (48%), while a tricuspid valve repair, was performed in four. No conversion to a full sternotomy was necessary in any of the cases. Postoperatively, the median intensive care unit and hospital stays were 4.7 and 11.8 days, respectively, with no in-hospital mortality. Following the initial treatment, all 21 patients were followed for a mean period of 30 ± 8.5 months (14-45 months). All patients returned to NYHA Class I or II following the procedure. During the follow-up period, there was no need for a heart valve reoperation for any of the patients and none showed recurrent mitral regurgitation (>mild), though one died from respiratory failure caused by pneumonia.
CONCLUSIONS: MIAMVS can be performed via a right mini-thoracotomy, with acceptable early and midterm results expected. This may be a feasible alternative to the standard median sternotomy approach.
