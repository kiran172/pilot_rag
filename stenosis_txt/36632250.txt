Title: Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Diseases in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review.

Abstract: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune condition in which the body's joints are attacked by the immune system, leaving the patient disabled in severe cases, with irreversible joint damage and a lower quality of life. RA patients are more likely to develop cardiovascular (CV) disease, which increases their risk of morbidity and mortality. This study systematically reviews various CV diseases that might occur with RA including heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndrome, ischemic heart disease, stroke, cardiac death, venous thromboembolism, and valvular diseases. The relation between these complications and RA is specifically assessed. Systematic search was carried out on literature reporting the risk of each of the CV diseases in RA patients from databases in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The databases searched were MEDLINE (through PubMed) and Google Scholar using a combination of keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH). Our keywords were mainly "cardiovascular diseases" and "arthritis and rheumatoid". We found a total of 33 articles reporting each CV comorbidity. Interestingly, a wide spectrum of CV diseases is reported in patients with RA. Many tools were implemented in the diagnosis of each disease such as carotid intima-media thickness for atherosclerosis and echocardiography for HF. We confirmed that RA is associated with an increased risk of different CV events, and prophylactic measures should be implemented.
