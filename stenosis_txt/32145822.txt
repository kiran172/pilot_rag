Title: An 80-Year-Old Woman With a Solitary Pulmonary Nodule.

Abstract: An 80-year-old-woman was referred for evaluation of chest pain that appeared after providing care at home for her sick husband, which included helping him to get up and move about. The pain was initially triggered by lifting heavy objects but then became constant, without exacerbating or relieving factors. The pain was located in the left hemithorax and was not associated with shortness of breath or cough. Because the patient did not feel any better after a month, her general practitioner ordered a radiograph, which revealed a suspicious pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe. She was a lifelong nonsmoker and denied any drug abuse. She had not been professionally exposed to lung carcinogens. She had a medical history of type 2 diabetes, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and renal artery stenosis. Her father died of lung cancer. She resided in Lille, France, and did not report any recent travel.
