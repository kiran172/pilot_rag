Title: The Evolution and Outcomes of the "Maddern Procedure" for the Treatment of Subglottic Stenosis.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: A novel technique to treat subglottic stenosis, the "Maddern Procedure", has been gaining acceptance in academic centers. This study describes the technique in detail, as well as its evolution over the first 28 patients performed at an academic center.
METHODS: A prospective case-series, with descriptive technique modifications cataloged throughout the 6 years needed to accumulate the patient cohort with a minimum of 2 years of follow-up (11/2015-11/2021). Main outcomes examined included changes to surgical indications, complications, and post-operative outcomes as measured by validated measures of voice and breathing.
RESULTS: Complete resection of subglottic scaring was performed, at first transcervically (2 pts), then transorally (26 pts). Successful performance of the procedure occurred in all patients without complications, with either successful decannulation of previously existing tracheotomies, or removal of perioperative tracheotomies. Buccal grafts (8/26) replaced skin graft as the graft of choice. Although high subglottic disease was first thought to be a contraindication, superior results became evident in cases of high stenosis rather than disease that included the upper trachea, with 4/26 patients requiring subsequent tracheal resection or tracheal dilation. Of the 22 remaining patients, 19/22 had successful arresting of restenosis, with 2/22 undergoing subsequent cricotracheal resection, and 1/22 pts requiring subglottic dilation. Overall, 19/26 Maddern pts (73%) had objectively favorable outcomes, with 24/26 (92%) reporting that they would have undergone the procedure again.
CONCLUSION: Full-thickness mucosal resection and relining of the subglottis is a developing technique that is a safe, yet technically challenging procedure which addresses the recurrent nature of the disease.
