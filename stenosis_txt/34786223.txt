Title: Wilkie Syndrome and Pseudo-Nutcracker Syndrome a Rare Combination: Description of a Case.

Abstract: Wilkie's syndrome is a very rare vascular alteration caused by congenital or acquired reduction of space between the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and aorta. In acquired form, it is caused by perivascular adipose tissue reduction due to rapid weight loss and, if symptomatic, causes postprandial vomiting and weight loss. The left renal vein (LRV) when it has a retro-aortic course can be compressed in aorto-vertebral space (AVS); if the stenosis is severe it can cause venous congestion symptoms with left flank pain, microhematuria, and thrombosis, this vascular alteration is known as a pseudo-nutcracker syndrome. The combination of Wilkie's and pseudo-nutcracker's syndrome (PNCS) is very rare and has not yet been described in the literature. We describe a case of a 62-year-old woman who presented symptoms and alterations typical of two syndromes.
