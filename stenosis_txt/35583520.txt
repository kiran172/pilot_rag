Title: Linear Versus Circular Laparoscopic Gastrojejunal Anastomosis of Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 22 Comparative Studies.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To compare the rate of complications of linear versus circular gastrojejunal anastomosis of laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases was carried out using the terms "laparoscopic," "circular," "linear," "anastomosis," "gastric bypass" in accordance to PRISMA guidelines. Only original articles in English language comparing linear versus circular anastomosis were included. No temporal interval was set. Outcome measures were wound infection, bleeding, marginal ulcer, leak, and stricture. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. Funnel plots were used to detect publication bias.
RESULTS: Twenty-two articles (7 prospective and 15 retrospective) out of 184 retrieved papers were included in this study. The pooled analysis showed a reduced odd of wound infection and bleeding after linear anastomosis. Likelihood of marginal ulcer, leak, and stricture was similar after the 2 techniques. Wound infection was reported in 15 studies (OR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.06-0.45; P=0.0003; I2=91), bleeding in 9 (OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.34-0.59; P=0.00001; I2=6) marginal ulcer in 11 (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.26-1.41; P=0.25; I2=65), leaks in 15 (OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.21-1.67; P=0.34; I2=83) and stricture in 18 (OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-1.00; P=0.05; I2=68).
CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic RYGB can be safely performed both with circular and linear staplers. Rates of wound infection and bleeding were significantly lower after linear gastrojejunal anastomosis.
