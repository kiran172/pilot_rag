Title: Aortic and Pulmonary Valve Reconstruction Using Autologous Pericardium in Narrow Annuli.

Abstract: A 71-year-old woman with pulmonary artery aneurysm had a complication of pulmonary valve stenosis with estimated right ventricular pressure 135 mm Hg and severe aortic valve stenosis with peak pressure gradient 112 mmHg. Coronary angiography revealed stenosis of the left coronary arterial system. Because she presented with narrow pulmonary annulus (16.7 mm) and aortic annulus (19.7 mm), we decided to perform aortic and pulmonary valve reconstruction using autologous pericardium. We performed aneurysmorrhaphy of the pulmonary artery, dual-valve reconstruction, and coronary artery bypass grafting. Postoperative echocardiography showed good opening of dual valves without regurgitation; estimated right ventricular pressure was 23 mm Hg.
