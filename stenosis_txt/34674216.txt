Title: Percutaneous Aspiration Thrombectomy for Arterial Thromboembolic Occlusion Following Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty: Technical Success Rates and Clinical Outcomes.

Abstract: PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze the technical success rate of manual percutaneous aspiration thrombectomy (PAT) in patients with peripheral arterial thromboembolism as a complication of infrainguinal percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and we sought to evaluate the 30-day postintervention clinical outcome.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively identified 29 patients (men/women, 18/11; mean age, 74 years) who underwent infrainguinal PAT to treat thromboembolic complications of infrainguinal PTA. Primary and secondary technical successes were defined as residual stenosis of < 50 % of the vessel diameter after PAT alone and PAT with additional PTA, respectively. Clinical outcome parameters (e. g., amputation, need for further intervention) were evaluated during the first 30 days after intervention.
RESULTS: The primary and secondary technical success rates were 58.6 % (17/29) and 79.3 % (23/29), respectively. Clinical outcome data were available for 93.1 % (27/29) of patients. No further intervention was required within 30 days in 81.5 % (22/27) of patients. Four patients underwent minor amputations owing to preexisting ulcerations (Rutherford Category 5), and no patients underwent major amputations (Rutherford Category 6). Revascularization of the previously treated vessel segment with PTA was necessary on the first postintervention day in one patient.
CONCLUSION: Manual PAT, with PTA if needed, has a good technical success rate and satisfactory early clinical outcome in patients with iatrogenic thromboembolic complications after infrainguinal PTA.
KEY POINTS: · Manual PAT is a possible first-choice treatment of infrainguinal PTA-induced acute thromboembolism.. · Performing additional PTA increases the success rate of manual PAT.. · Unlike catheter-directed intraarterial lysis, manual PAT carries no risk of bleeding..
