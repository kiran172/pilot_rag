Title: Snuffbox approach for balloon aortic valvuloplasty: A case series.

Abstract: In the era of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), the spectrum of indications for balloon aortic valvuloplasty is growing, especially in old and frail patients. Mini-invasive approaches via radial access reduce vascular complications and length of hospital stay. The snuffbox approach has never been described for Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). We performed a review of patients who underwent BAV using distal radial access between January 2019 and December 2019 in a single Italian Centre. All patients received a 30-day follow-up. The procedure was successfully conducted by anatomical snuffbox in all reported cases. All patients were mobilized within 10â€‰h from the procedure without vascular access-related complications. Thirty-day color Doppler ultrasound showed distal radial artery patency in 89% of cases. In our case series, the snuffbox approach for balloon aortic valvuloplasty appeared to be safe and feasible. This approach could be a valid alternative especially in old and frail adults waiting for TAVR.
