Title: 3-Dimensional CT Planning for TAVR With a Novel Self-Expandable Valve in a Calcified Anatomy.

Abstract: Recently, a novel transfemoral self-expandable valve (JenaValve Trilogy) was granted a CE mark as a dedicated device for transfemoral treatment of both aortic valve stenosis and regurgitation. Here, we highlight the importance of 3-dimensional preprocedural planning for the optimal choice of a prosthesis in challenging anatomies by reporting an unusual case of a heavily calcified aortic sinus.
