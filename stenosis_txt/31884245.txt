Title: Design, methodology and baseline characteristics of the Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation-Coronary Vascular Dysfunction (WISE-CVD).

Abstract: UNLABELLED: A significant number of women with signs and symptoms of ischemia with no obstructive coronary artery disease (INOCA) have coronary vascular dysfunction detected by invasive coronary reactivity testing (CRT). However, the noninvasive assessment of coronary vascular dysfunction has been limited.
METHODS: The Women's Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation-Coronary Vascular Dysfunction (WISE-CVD) was a prospective study of women with suspected INOCA aimed to investigate whether (1) cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) abnormalities in left ventricular morphology and function and myocardial perfusion predict CRT measured coronary microvascular dysfunction, (2) these persistent CMRI abnormalities at 1-year follow-up predict persistent symptoms of ischemia, and (3) these CMRI abnormalities predict cardiovascular outcomes. By design, a sample size of 375 women undergoing clinically indicated invasive coronary angiography for suspected INOCA was projected to complete baseline CMRI, a priori subgroup of 200 clinically indicated CRTs, and a priori subgroup of 200 repeat 1-year follow-up CMRIs.
RESULTS: A total of 437 women enrolled between 2008 and 2015, 374 completed baseline CMRI, 279 completed CRT, and 214 completed 1-year follow-up CMRI. Mean age was 55± 11 years, 93% had 20%-50% coronary stenosis, and 7% had <20% stenosis by angiography.
CONCLUSIONS: The WISE-CVD study investigates the utility of noninvasive CMRI to predict coronary vascular dysfunction in comparison to invasive CRT, and the prognostic value of CMRI abnormalities for persistent symptoms of ischemia and cardiovascular outcomes in women with INOCA. WISE-CVD will provide new understanding of a noninvasive imaging modality for future clinical trials.
