Title: Anterior cerebral artery dilation to increase cerebral perfusion in a patient with chronic internal carotid artery occlusion.

Abstract: Chronic internal carotid artery occlusions (CICAO) increase the risk of stroke recurrence and cognitive dysfunction. Here, we describe the case of an adult patient with ipsilateral CICAO who underwent endovascular treatment of anterior cerebral artery stenosis to improve cerebral perfusion. First, the patient presented ataxia and left facial palsy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed right hemispherpe cerebral infarct, right CICAO, and sub-occlusive stenosis of the left bulbar internal carotid artery. Stenting of the left carotid artery was performed. One year later, she experienced acute walking imbalance and left hemiparesis. MRI showed new watershed and anterior cerebral artery infarctions, worsening of the right hemisphere hypoperfusion, and a new severe stenosis of the right anterior cerebral artery. Dilation of this stenosis was performed. Perfusion parameters, clinical deficit, and cognitive functions improved after the endovascular treatment, and the patient had no stroke recurrence.
