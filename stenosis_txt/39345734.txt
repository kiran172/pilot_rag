Title: Tuberculosis Meningitis in a 9-Month-Old Girl during the COVID-19 Pandemic.

Abstract: Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a serious form of TB disease that can result in high morbidity and mortality, particularly if there are delays in diagnosis and treatment. In this case report, a 9-month-old girl was admitted with persistent vomiting and focal seizures. On examination, she was found to have a right-side hemiparesis. Brain imaging showed intense nodular leptomeningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, a hypolucent lesion in the left basal ganglia, arterial stenosis and vasculitis, and an old ischemic insult. The patient was initially diagnosed with an acute ischemic stroke and was treated with aspirin and antiepileptic drugs. The patient's condition failed to improve despite initial treatment, leading to further diagnostic procedures. The results uncovered a diagnosis of TBM. The case highlights the importance of considering TBM as a possible cause of neurological symptoms, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic where similar symptoms can be present in cases of neurological complications of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C).
