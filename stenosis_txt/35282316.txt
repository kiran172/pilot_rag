Title: Subclavian atherectomy and angioplasty for coronary subclavian steal syndrome post CABG.

Abstract: Coronary subclavian steal syndrome is an uncommon complication occurring in patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). We describe a case of a 69-year-old male with a remote history of CABG who presented with exertional left arm pain and angina. Computed Tomographic Angiography of the chest demonstrated a severe left proximal subclavian artery stenosis. The case demonstrates successful application of subclavian atherectomy with use of embolic protective device, alleviating the need of stent, for treatment of Coronary subclavian steal syndrome in patient with remote history of CABG.
