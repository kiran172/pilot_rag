Title: 1-Year outcomes of Resolute Onyx Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent for symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease: A multicenter propensity score-matched comparison with stenting versus aggressive medical management for preventing recurrent stroke in intracranial stenosis trial.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is one of the most prevalent causes of stroke across the world. Endovascular treatment has gained prominence but remains a challenge with unfavorable results. Recent literature has demonstrated that the Resolute Onyx Zotarolimus-Eluting Stent (RO-ZES) is a technically safe option with low complication rates along with 30-day outcomes associated with intracranial stent placement for ICAD with RO-ZES compared to results from the Stenting Versus Aggressive Medical Management for Preventing Recurrent Stroke in Intracranial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) trial. Here, we aim to compare outcomes at one year with the SAMMPRIS trial with a multicenter longitudinal study.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Prospectively maintained databases across seven stroke centers were analyzed for adult patients undergoing RO-ZES placement for ICAD between January 2019 and May 2023. The primary endpoint was composite of one-year stroke, ICH, and/or death. These data were propensity score matched using age, sex, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking status, and impacted vessel for comparison between RO-ZES and the SAMMPRIS percutaneous angioplasty and stenting groups (S-PTAS).
RESULTS: A total of 104 patients were included, mean age ± SD: 64.9 ± 10.9 years, 25.5% female. Propensity score match analysis of the 104 patients with S-PTAS demonstrated one-year stroke, ICH, and/or death rate of 11.5% in the RO-ZES group and 28.1% in the S-PTAS group (odds ratio 4.17, 95% CI 2.06-8.96, p = 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The RO-ZES system demonstrates strong potential to reduce long-term complications at one year compared with the S-PTAS group. Further prospective multicenter studies are needed to corroborate and build upon these findings.
