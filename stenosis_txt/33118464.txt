Title: Transcervical Access for Endograft Exclusion of a Postendarterectomy Carotid Pseudoaneurysm in a Patient With Type III Aortic Arch.

Abstract: Postendarterectomy carotid pseudoaneurysms are infrequent. The endovascular treatment is less invasive, with a minor risk of complications. However, the presence of a highly angulated aortic arch (type III) is a challenge, since the navigation of endovascular devices is not favorable. Through transcervical access, it is possible to deliver the devices directly into the carotid artery. We herein present a case of a postendarterectomy carotid pseudoaneurysm in a patient with type III aortic arch that was successfully treated with transcervical endograft exclusion.
