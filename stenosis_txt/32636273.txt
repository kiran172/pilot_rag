Title: Non-invasive stereotactic ablative boost in patients with locally advanced cervical cancer.

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: The current literature is insufficient to guide care for patients with cervical cancer ineligible for brachytherapy. Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy boost is a clinical necessity for these patients, but highly debated among radiation oncologists.
OBJECTIVE: To report toxicity and survival outcomes in a large cohort of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with a non-invasive stereotactic ablative radiotherapy boost instead of brachytherapy METHODS: Patients with locally advanced cervical cancer were entered, between January 2008 and December 2018, who were recommended definitive intent external boost after pelvic radiotherapy to 45-50.4 Gy concurrent with weekly cisplatin and simultaneous/sequential nodal boost up to 55-66 Gy. Simulation CT was facilitated using radio-opaque fiducials, empty rectum, dedicated bladder filling, and whole body vaculoplastic immobilization. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to report local/regional recurrences, distant metastases, cancer-specific survival, and overall survival.
RESULTS: A total of 25 patients were analyzed. Median follow-up was 25 months (range 6-54). Patients received stereotactic ablative radiotherapy due to refusal of brachytherapy (9/25, 36%), medical co-morbidities limiting implantation (9/25, 36%), or technical infeasibility (7/25, 28%). Typical fractionation was 24-30 Gy in 4-5 fractions (24/25, 96%). The most common long-term toxicity was grade 1-2 vaginal dryness, discomfort, stenosis, and/or dyspareunia (4/25, 16%). One patient had new post-treatment grade 4 fistula in an area of previous tumor erosion (1/25, 4%). Overall survival, cancer specific survival, loco-regional control, and distant control were 95.5%, 100%, 95.5%, and 89.1%, respectively, at 2 years.
CONCLUSION: Further study of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy boost for cervical cancer is needed; a brachytherapy-similar approach portends clinical success with 95.5% overall survival and loco-regional control at 2 years.
