Title: Cardiac magnetic resonance of hypertrophic heart phenotype: A review.

Abstract: Hypertrophic heart phenotype is characterized by an abnormal left ventricular (LV) thickening. A hypertrophic phenotype can develop as adaptive response in many different conditions such as aortic stenosis, hypertension, athletic training, infiltrative heart muscle diseases, storage disorders and metabolic disorders. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most frequent primary cardiomyopathy (CMP) and a genetical cause of cardiac hypertrophy. It requires the exclusion of any other cause of LV hypertrophy. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is a comprehensive imaging technique that allows a detailed evaluation of myocardial diseases. It provides reproducible measurements and myocardial tissue characterization. In clinical practice CMR is increasingly used to confirm the presence of ventricular hypertrophy, to detect the underlying cause of the phenotype and more recently as an efficient prognostic tool. This article aims to provide a detailed overview of the applications of CMR in the setting of hypertrophic heart phenotype and its role in the diagnostic workflow of such condition.
