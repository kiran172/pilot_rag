Title: Rheumatic mitral stenosis in a 28-week pregnant woman treated by mitral valvuoplasty guided by low dose of radiation: a case report and brief overview.

Abstract: Rheumatic mitral stenosis is still a pathological condition that affects young patients and is an important cause of mortality. 2017-European Guidelines for the management of valvular heart disease suggest a percutaneous approach with a mitral commissurotomy for the treatment of symptomatic pregnant women. Mitral commissurotomy procedure involves radiation exposure that is incompatible with the pregnancy condition. In our case, we present percutaneous mitral commissurotomy (PMC) to a 28-week pregnant woman with a low-radiation dose and the use of transesophageal echocardiography. The woman presented with a mitral transvalvular mean gradient of 21.6Â mmHg and with symptoms non-responsive to medical treatment. PMC was driven by a transesophageal echocardiographic probe. This case demonstrates the feasibility and safety of PMC in a pregnant woman with severe rheumatic mitral stenosis.
