Title: Endoscopic Balloon Dilatation in Pediatric Crohn Disease: An IBD Porto Group Study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND: Endoscopic balloon dilatation (EBD) has been shown to be effective and safe in adults with stricturing Crohn disease (CD) yet pediatric data is sparse. We aimed to assess efficacy and safety of EBD in stricturing pediatric CD.
METHODS: International collaboration included 11 centers from Europe, Canada, and Israel. Recorded data included patient demographics, stricture features, clinical outcomes, procedural adverse events, and need for surgery. Primary outcome was surgery-free over 12 months and secondary outcomes were clinical response and adverse events.
RESULTS: Eighty-eight dilatations were performed over 64 dilatation series in 53 patients. Mean age at CD diagnosis was 11.1 (±4.0) years, stricture length 4 cm [interquartile range (IQR) 2.8-5], and bowel wall thickness 7 mm (IQR 5.3-8). Twelve of 64 (19%) patients underwent surgery in the year following the dilatation series, at a median of 89 days (IQR 24-120; range 0-264) following EBD. Seven of 64 (11%) had subsequent unplanned EBD over the year, of whom two eventually underwent surgical resection. Two of 88 (2%) perforations were recorded, 1 of whom was managed surgically, and 5 patients had minor adverse events managed conservatively. There was a significant improvement in all clinical measures following EBD with weighted pediatric CD activity index-defined remission increasing from 13% at baseline to 44%, 46%, and 61%, and absence of obstructive symptoms in 55%, 53%, and 64% of patients at week 2, 8, and 24 respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: In this largest study of EBD in pediatric stricturing CD to date, we demonstrated that EBD is effective in relieving symptoms and avoiding surgery. Adverse events rates were low and consistent with adult data.
