Title: Esophageal ganglioneuromatosis; a rare cause of intractable esophageal stenosis: a case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Ganglioneuromatosis is a rare type of benign neurogenic tumor that usually affects the sites of the major sympathetic ganglia in the retroperitoneum and the posterior mediastinum. Affection of the gastrointestinal tract is rare, and involvement of the esophagus is exceptional. To the best of our knowledge, only 4 cases of esophageal ganglioneuromatosis in adults were reported in the literature. No cases have been reported in the pediatric age group.
CASE PRESENTATION: An 11-year-old boy presented with dysphagia due to severe esophageal stenosis caused by esophageal ganglioneuromatosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Despite its rarity, the present case implies that ganglioneuromatosis should be considered in children with idiopathic esophageal stenosis.
