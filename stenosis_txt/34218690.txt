Title: Oversized balloon angioplasty for endovascular maturation of arteriovenous fistulae to accelerate cannulation and to decrease the duration of catheter use.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The functional autologous arteriovenous fistula is considered the best vascular access for patients on hemodialysis. Some fistulae exhibit maturation problems after creation and do not reach adequate vessel diameter and flow in dialysis. The aim of this study was to describe our technique of oversized balloon angioplasty for assisted maturation of arteriovenous fistulae to accelerate the cannulation and to decrease the time of catheter use and its outcome.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of balloon-assisted procedures for maturation failure was performed in a single center between October 2011 and January 2019. Patients underwent imaging procedures to identify stenosis, followed by angioplasty using oversized high-pressure balloons from the anastomosis to the deep venous outflow tract. The flow volume, time interval of use of the fistula and removal of the catheter, patency rates, and complications rates were evaluated.
RESULTS: Seventy-eight patients underwent 124 balloon angioplasty procedures. Technical and clinical success was achieved in 91% of the cases. In patients in whom maturation was successful, the fistula was cannulated in a mean time of 5 days after the procedure (range, 1-20 days). On average, catheter removal was performed 14 days (range, 5-33 days) after the maturation procedure. The mean flow volume in the fistula before the procedure was 276 ml/min (range, 122-488 ml/min) and 24 h after the maturation was 1014 ml/min (range, 760-1800 ml/min).The primary patency rate at 3, 6, and 12 months was 87.3%, 66.2%, and 50.7%, respectively. Assisted primary patency was 100% at 3 months, 92.9% at 6 months, and 90.0% at 12 months. Minor complications occurred in 18% of cases, and major complications in 4.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: The oversized balloon-assisted arteriovenous fistula maturation technique is safe and effective, allowing the cannulation of the fistulae a few hours or days after the procedure and decreasing the time of catheter use.
