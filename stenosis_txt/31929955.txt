Title: Diagnostically Challenging Case of Renal Artery Stenosis in a Pediatric Patient.

Abstract: In this study we report a diagnostically challenging case of bilateral renal artery stenosis (RAS) in a nine-year-old boy presenting as uncontrolled hypertension (HTN). The objective of this clinical case report is to draw attention to the unlikely combination of a classical clinical presentation with several normal investigations. This is a nine-year-old boy, known to have uncontrolled HTN, later diagnosed as a case ofÂ bilateral RAS. This patient underwent several imaging studies including: renal Doppler ultrasonography (US), diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) scan, and mercaptuacetyltriglycine (MAG3) renal scintigraphy with captopril challenge, with the aim of determining the cause of his uncontrolled HTN. The previously mentioned imaging procedures were carried out at two different medical centers over an extended period of time; however, the images failed to show any anatomical abnormalities to explain his clinical presentation. Due to this unexpected result the primary team in charge of this case opted for a percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, as a diagnostic and therapeutic approach, by which the final diagnosis of bilateral RAS was concluded. During follow-up the patient was asymptomatic in all outpatient clinic appointments. Even though several initial investigations failed to indicate RAS, clinicians may pursue further investigations in cases of classical clinical presentation of uncontrolled HTN in pediatric population so as to not miss any diagnostically challenging cases.
