Title: Assessing the risk of stroke development following retinal artery occlusion.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Retinal artery occlusion (RAO) can cause acute, painless, and irreversible loss of vision. Using a large sample population database, we investigated the possible impact of RAO and numerous other clinical and non-clinical factors on the risk of developing a subsequent cerebrovascular accident.
METHODS: Cases of RAO were obtained from the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database between 2002 and 2013 using ICD-9 codes. Associated morbidities and procedures were assessed in these cases with a primary hospital admitting diagnosis of stroke. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out in RAO cases to determine risk factors for stroke. The Bonferroni correction method was applied.
RESULTS: The RAO group consisted of 19,809 cases that were separated into stroke (n=1,157, 55% male, mean age: 69±0.4 years) and non-stroke (n=18,652, 55% male, mean age: 68±0.1) cohorts. Age groups associated with reduced risk of stroke with respect to were 20-39 (OR: 0.391), 40-59 (OR: 0.842), and 60-79 (OR: 0.837). No cases of stroke were present for ages < 20. Other factors associated with a reduced stroke risk were carotid stenosis (OR: 0.187), transient ischemic attack (OR: 0.064), coronary artery disease (OR: 0.788), cardiac catheterization (OR: 0.481), and septicemia (OR: 0.333). Factors associated with an increased risk of stroke included hypertension (OR: 1.418), tobacco use (OR: 1.568), valvular disease (OR: 1.359), hyperlipidemia (OR: 1.298), and non-stroke cerebrovascular disease (OR: 2.985).
CONCLUSIONS: A large patient population was used to determine that RAO patients with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, tobacco usage, valvular disease, or non-stroke cerebrovascular disease had an increased risk of stroke. Patients below the age of 40 had significantly reduced the odds of stroke. Carotid stenosis, coronary artery disease, transient ischemic attacks, cardiac catheterization, and septicemia were all independently associated with a decreased risk of stroke development in RAO patients.
