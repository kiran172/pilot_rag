Title: Protamine-induced Acute Thrombosis in a Post-TAVR Patient: A Word of Caution.

Abstract: Major vascular complications after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) are a pertinent issue and associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We herein describe a case of acute limb ischemia following the administration of protamine sulfate (PS) that was administered to mitigate a bleeding complication post-failure of a vascular access closure device. PS should be used cautiously for the prevention or management of bleeding-site complications following TAVR. The patient described in this case has consented to having his case described in this manuscript.
