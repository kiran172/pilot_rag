Title: Effectiveness of X-stop Interspinous Distractor Device Versus Laminectomy for Treatment of Lumbar Stenosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.

Abstract: Lumbar spinal stenosis refers to the narrowing of the spinal canal in the lumbar region. There is an increasing need to determine the treatment modality for lumbar spinal stenosis by comparing the outcomes of X-stop interspinous distractors and laminectomy. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the X-stop interspinous distractor compared to laminectomy. This systematic review fundamentally abides by the procedures delineated in the Cochrane methodology while the reporting is done according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Three databases searched generated a total of 943 studies, with PubMed being the source for the bulk of the articles. Six studies were selected for inclusion in this study. The effectiveness of the interspinous distractor devices and laminectomy can be determined through their impact on the quality of life, rates of complications, and the amount of money utilized. This meta-analysis fundamentally emphasizes that laminectomy is a more effective intervention for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis as it is more cost-effective and results in fewer complications in the long term.
