Title: Review of patients with achondroplasia: a single-center's experience with follow-up and associated morbidities.

Abstract: Achondroplasia (ACH; MIM #100,800), caused by a heterozygous gain of function pathogenic variant in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 gene (FGFR3; MIM*134,934), is the most prevalent and most readily identifiable cause of disproportionate short stature that is compatible with life. In addition, individuals with achondroplasia face significant medical, functional, and psychosocial challenges throughout their lives. This study assessed associated morbidities in patients with achondroplasia at a single center in Turkey. In this study, the clinical findings and associated morbidities of a group of patients with achondroplasia (n = 68) with clinical multidisciplinary follow-up at a single center between the years 2005-2023 are evaluated retrospectively. A total of 68 patients, 30 male (44.1%) and 38 female (55.9%), were evaluated. In the majority (84.2%) of patients, shortness of extremities was detected in the prenatal period at an average of 28.7 gestational weeks (± 3.6 SDS) with the aid of ultrasonography. More than half (n = 34/63, 54%) of the patients had a father of advanced paternal age (≥ 35 years). Among the complications, respiratory system manifestations, including obstructive sleep apnea (70%), ear-nose-throat manifestations including adenoid hypertrophy (56.6%) and otitis media (54.7%), neurological manifestations due to foramen magnum stenosis (53.2%), and skeletal manifestations including scoliosis (28.8%), are represented among the most common. The mortality rate was 7.3% (n = 5/68).Conclusion: This study not only represents the first retrospective analysis of the associated morbidities of patients with achondroplasia from a single center in Turkey but also will provide a reference point for future studies.
