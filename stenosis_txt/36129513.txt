Title: Symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid near-occlusions have very similar angiographic appearance on CT-angiography.

Abstract: The aim of this study was to compare the angiographic appearance of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid near-occlusion. We have found no such previous study. The study hypothesis was that among symptomatic patients with ≥ 50% carotid stenosis, near-occlusion is more common and near-occlusions are more severe than among asymptomatic persons with ≥ 50% carotid stenosis. We reassessed consecutive CTAs from 4042 persons, 645 had ≥ 50% carotid stenosis, and 385 (60%) symptomatic. Near-occlusion was similarly common in symptomatic (105, 27%) and asymptomatic (56, 24%) cases. Among near-occlusions, the angiographic appearance was very similar between symptomatic and asymptomatic cases: mean stenosis lumen diameter (0.7 mm), distal ICA diameter (2.1 mm), and ECA ratio (0.79) were the same in both groups. Mean ICA ratio (0.46 and 0.48) and share of full collapse was very similar (45% and 42%). These findings add to the pathophysiological understanding of carotid near-occlusion.
