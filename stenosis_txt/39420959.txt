Title: Veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation supported transcatheter aortic valve implantation in a high-risk COVID-19 patient: a comprehensive case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The sudden onset of heart failure in high-risk transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) candidates poses significant challenges, necessitating meticulous planning and consideration of mechanical circulatory support options. Nevertheless, existing data on the efficacy and safety of mechanical circulatory support in this context are limited, along with criteria for patient selection.
CASE SUMMARY: An 87-year-old patient, with severe low-flow low-gradient aortic stenosis, presented with acute heart failure and concurrent COVID-19 pneumonia. Despite initial conservative management, her clinical condition deteriorated, requiring inotropic support. The decision was made to perform a rescue TAVI procedure with veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support. The patient underwent successful TAVI while managing complications, including cardiac arrest, with haemodynamic support from veno-arterial ECMO. Post-procedure, the patient showed improved cardiac function and was discharged in stable condition.
DISCUSSION: This case underscores the significance of strategic patient selection, proactive haemodynamic management, and the judicious use of veno-arterial ECMO in high-risk TAVI, particularly in complex scenarios involving acute heart failure and respiratory insufficiency, exacerbated by COVID-19. It highlights the challenges and critical decision points in TAVI planning, emphasizing the need for further research and standardized guidelines to refine indications for prophylactic mechanical circulatory support in TAVI procedures.
