Title: Cerebral multi-autoregulation model based enhanced external counterpulsation treatment planning for cerebral ischemic stroke.

Abstract: Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) treatment for cerebral ischemic stroke patients with differing severity of stenosis, is subject to uncertainties due to the varying effects of the cerebral autoregulation mechanism on haemodynamics. The current study reports the development of a cerebral multi-autoregulation (MR) mathematical model, based on cerebral arteriole regulation of neurogenic, vascular smooth muscle reflex and shear stress mechanisms which takes into account the severity of stenosis. The model was evaluated by comparison to authentic clinical measurements of cerebral autoregulatory efficiency. Then it was applied to a 0D/3D geometric multi-scale haemodynamic model of a cerebral artery. Haemodynamic indicators were calculated under different pressurization durations of EECP to evaluate the efficacy for different stenosis lesions. Moderate stenosis of 50% to 60% produced excessive time-averaged wall shear stress in the distal area of the stenosis (>7â€‰Pa) during prolonged pressurization and may result in damage to vascular endothelial cells. However, prolonged pressurization did not result in haemodynamic risk for severe stenosis of 70% to 80%, indicating that the duration of pressurization may be extended with increasing severity of stenosis. The current MR model accurately simulated cerebral blood flow and has relevance to the simulation of cerebral haemodynamics in a clinical setting.
