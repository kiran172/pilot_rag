Title: A Case of TAVR Complicated by Severe Functional Mitral Regurgitation.

Abstract: Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a known complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). We report a case of a 90-year-old man with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent elective TAVR. The procedure was complicated by severe functional MR from left ventricular stunning and dilatation caused by hypotension throughout the procedure. An Impella CP (Abiomed, Inc, Danvers, MA) was inserted to unload the left ventricle and decrease its size with subsequent improvement in MR severity, which was sustained after Impella CP removal. In conclusion, we present the first case of successful management of post-TAVR severe functional MR with an Impella CP.
