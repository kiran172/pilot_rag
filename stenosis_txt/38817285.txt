Title: Treatment of anastomotic stricture after rectal cancer operation by magnetic compression technique: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The treatment of postoperative anastomotic stenosis (AS) after resection of colorectal cancer is challenging. Endoscopic balloon dilation is used to treat stenosis in such cases, but some patients do not show improvement even after multiple balloon dilations. Magnetic compression technique (MCT) has been used for gastrointestinal anastomosis, but its use for the treatment of postoperative AS after colorectal cancer surgery has rarely been reported.
CASE SUMMARY: We report a 72-year-old man who underwent radical resection of colorectal cancer and ileostomy one year ago. An ileostomy closure was prepared six months ago, but colonoscopy revealed a narrowing of the rectal anastomosis. Endoscopic balloon dilation was performed three times, but colonoscopy showed no significant improvement in stenosis. The AS was successfully treated using MCT.
CONCLUSION: MCT is a minimally invasive method that can be used for the treatment of postoperative AS after colorectal cancer surgery.
