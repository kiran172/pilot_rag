Title: Outcomes of surgical repair of Type III and IV laryngotracheoesophageal clefts with posterior cartilage grafting.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To describe the clinical outcomes of patients who underwent surgical repair through an anterior approach that involved interposition a posterior cartilage for Type III or Type IV laryngotracheoesophageal cleft (LTEC).
METHODS: A chart view was performed on patients with Type III or Type IV LTEC between May 2017 and May 2022. Demographic features and surgical outcomes were collected and analyzed.
RESULTS: Seven patients were finally included. Five patients were diagnosed with Type III LTEC and two patients were diagnosed with Type IV LTEC. All but one patients survived and thrived. Four patients were able to successfully extubate with acceptable voice, and two patients were tracheostomized. Five patients were deemed safe for all consistencies food and one was safe for thickened food. After a mean follow-up of 49 months (18-83 months), neither complications nor recurrences were observed.
CONCLUSION: An anterior laryngofissure approach to the cleft repair with a posterior cartilage grafting is an effective and safe treatment for Type III or IV LTEC, which enables closure of LTEC and reconstruction of cricoid plate in order to avoid tracheoesophageal fistula formation or subglottic stenosis postoperatively. Severe tracheomalacia and GERD are two main causes for surgical failure.
