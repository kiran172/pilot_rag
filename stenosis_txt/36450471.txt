Title: Acute Myocardial Infarction Due to Coronary Artery Embolism during Chemotherapy with mFOLFOX-6 Plus Bevacizumab for Metastatic Colon Cancer.

Abstract: Bevacizumab, a monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor, may be associated with arterial embolisms. We herein report a case of acute myocardial infarction caused by coronary embolism during combination chemotherapy with mFOLFOX-6 and bevacizumab in a patient with metastatic colon cancer. Thromboembolism occurred only in the distal right posterolateral branch without stenotic lesions or plaque rupture in the proximal branch of the right coronary artery. Sole thromboaspiration was successfully performed; the final angiogram demonstrated no stenosis in the right coronary artery. Bevacizumab may be associated with acute coronary syndrome in patients with coronary risk factors, despite no significant coronary narrowing.
