Title: Unstable Carotid Plaque as a Phenotype of Chronic Systemic Inflammation Enhances Renal Insufficiency.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Chronic systemic inflammation is prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is linked to the development of cerebrovascular disease. In this study, we explored the association between the unstable plaques and preoperative CKD in patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA)/carotid artery stenting (CAS). Furthermore, this study also aimed to explore whether there is a difference in the aggravation of renal function with the presence of stable or unstable plaques.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 90 patients who underwent CEA/CAS for carotid artery stenosis. Multivariate analysis was performed to determine the risk factors for CKD. Kaplan-Meier estimation was employed to evaluate the aggravation of renal function following CEA/CAS.
RESULTS: Multivariate analysis revealed that contralateral carotid occlusive disease (odds ratio [OR], 4.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-14.6), and T1 high-intensity carotid plaque (OR, 3.26; 95% CI, 1.2-8.86) were independent factors of CKD. Kaplan-Meier estimation demonstrated a higher aggravation of renal function in the T1 high-intensity group compared to those in the iso-intensity (P =.03). Following CEA/CAS, the time until aggravation of renal insufficiency was 12.0 ± 9.4 months in the T1 high-intensity group and 24.5 ± 9.6 months in the iso-intensity group (P =.03).
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that contralateral carotid artery stenosis and T1 high-intensity plaques are more frequently observed in patients with CKD. T1 high-intensity carotid plaque is well linked to CKD development in future.
