Title: Acute disc herniation following surgical decompression of lumbar spinal stenosis: a retrospective comparison of mini-open and minimally invasive techniques.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Disc herniation following decompression of lumbar spinal stenosis is a less familiar surgical complication. Previous studies suggested that open lumbar decompression techniques, associated with relative segmental instability especially in the presence of degenerated disc in older patients, are more likely to result in disc herniation compared to minimally invasive techniques. The current study compares the incidence of acute disc herniation following mini-open and minimally invasive decompression of lumbar spinal stenosis.
METHODS: This was a retrospective study reviewing 563 patients who underwent spinal decompression for symptomatic lumbar stenosis by mini-open bilateral partial laminectomy technique or minimally invasive laminotomy utilizing a tubular system. Demographic and clinical data were collected and compared between the groups.
RESULTS: Postoperative disc herniation rate was significantly lower in the minimally invasive group with 2 of 237 cases (0.8%) versus 19 of 326 cases (5.8%) in the mini-open group (p = 0.002). This finding was more noticeable following multi-level procedures with no case of postdecompression disc herniation in the minimally invasive group compared to 8 of 39 cases (20.5%) in the mini-open group (p = 0.003).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative disc herniation following spinal decompression for symptomatic lumbar stenosis was 5.8% following mini-open bilateral partial laminectomy compared to only 0.8% after minimally invasive laminotomy (p = 0.002). These findings highlight the more extensive nature of mini-open surgery associated with relative segmental instability that poses a greater risk for postoperative disc herniation.
