Title: Medical Therapy to Prevent or Slow Progression of Aortic Stenosis: Current Evidence and Future Directions.

Abstract: Degenerative aortic stenosis is a growing clinical problem owing to the high incidence in an aging population and its significant morbidity and mortality. Currently, aortic valve replacement remains the only treatment. Despite promising observational data, pharmacological management to slow or halt progression of aortic stenosis has remained elusive. Nevertheless, with a greater understanding of the mechanisms which underpin aortic stenosis, research has begun to explore novel treatment strategies. This review will explore the historical agents used to manage aortic stenosis and the emerging agents that are currently under investigation.
