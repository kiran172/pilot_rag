Title: Novel technique of percutaneous bypass in a brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula with cephalic arch occlusion: A case report.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Arteriovenous fistulas are a principal mainstay of long-term dialysis access for patients with end stage renal failure. However, the patency of arteriovenous fistulas is limited, often requiring percutaneous transluminal angioplasty as a salvage procedure. We report a case of percutaneous method of arteriovenous fistula salvage.
METHODS: A gentleman with brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistula created in 2015 was admitted under us for dialysis access issue. His fistula history was notable for recurrent and refractory venous outflow stenosis of the cephalic vein and the cephalic arch with multiple previous interventions. Ultrasound showed cephalic arch occlusion with high venous pressures. He underwent left brachicephalic fistula percutaneous bypass. We describe the percutaneous creation of a brachial-subclavian arteriovenous fistula via a bypass graft from a worsening brachial-cephalic fistula with cephalic arch occlusion that is not amendable to angioplasty.
RESULTS: Final angiogram showed smooth flow to central vein. He is 2â€‰years post procedure, and his fistula remained patent with no interventions required.
CONCLUSION: Percutaneously created jump bypass grafts can reliably produce sustained long-term patency.
