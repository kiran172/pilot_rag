Title: [A Case of Pathologic Complete Response Achieved with Preoperative Pembrolizumab Therapy for Transverse Colon Cancer].

Abstract: A 77-year-old female patient presented with a medical history of 4 cancerous lesions, each with a surgical history. She was referred to our hospital due to anemia. Upon examination, she was diagnosed with transverse colon cancer. Duodenal invasion was suspected, which made performing R0 surgery difficult; therefore, the NAC approach was chosen. Three courses of CAPOX were administered, resulting in tumor obstruction, leading to the formation of an ileum stoma. MSI testing revealed MSI-H, and pembrolizumab treatment was initiated. CT scans showed tumor shrinkage, and PET scans indicated no accumulation, resulting in a cCR. Colon resection including the lesion suspected of stenosis was performed with a strong desire for stoma closure and the determination of potential curative resection. Additionally, a partial resection of the duodenum was performed. Pathological examination did not reveal any evident tumor cells, leading to the determination for a pCR. The patient has been under postoperative surveillance for 1 year without any recurrence.
