Title: [Surgical results of tetralogy of Fallot repair with pulmonary valve preservation techniques].

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The long-term complications arising from chronic pulmonary insufficiency after surgical correction of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) are well documented. In our center, innovative techniques for pulmonary valve (PV) preservation have been adopted and developed for over 10 years.
METHODS: All patients with TOF and PV stenosis who underwent surgery at our center between January 2008 and December 2022 were included in this study. Patients were evaluated using echocardiography during follow-up, comparing those who underwent classic surgery with transannular patch (TAP) placement and those who underwent PV preservation techniques.
RESULTS: Of the 134 patients, 99 (73.9%) were successfully treated using PV preservation techniques. At the time of surgery, the median age was 4.3 months (interquartile range [IQR] 3.4-5.9 months). The median preoperative PV z-score was -2.87 (IQR -3.61;-2.48). The median follow-up time from surgery was 6.6 years (IQR 3.5-8.4 years). During the median follow-up, the right ventricular area change fraction was 47% (IQR 43-50%) in patients treated with PV preservation and 43% (IQR 41-47%) in the TAP group (p=0.005). These data were associated with better PV function in patients treated with preservation. Specifically, insufficiency was mild in 12%, moderate in 35%, and severe in 53% of patients in the TAP group. Conversely, insufficiency was mild in 53%, moderate in 35%, and severe in 11% of patients treated with preservation (p<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Annular integrity and PV function can be preserved during early TOF correction. PV preservation can prevent the long-term development of pulmonary insufficiency and right ventricular dysfunction.
