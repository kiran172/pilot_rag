Title: Technical details of and prognosis for the "China stitch", a novel technique for totally laparoscopic hand-sewn esophagojejunostomy.

Abstract: The current study describes the technical details of and the clinical prognosis for the "China stitch", a novel technique for hand-sewn esophagojejunostomy in totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy. This study also explores the feasibility and safety of the technique. Clinical data of 20 patients with esophagogastric junction cancer in Beijing Shijitan Hospital, Capital Medical University from January 2017 to April 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All 20 patients underwent esophagojejunostomy via a novel hand-sewn technique that uses traction to turn the left or right wall of the esophagus into an anterior wall. This avoids the difficulty of suturing the posterior wall. All patients were followed until June 2019. All 20 patients successfully underwent the procedure. The mean operating time was 216.5 ± 24.9 (176-254) min, the mean hand-sewn reconstruction time was 44.4 ± 9.4 (26-61) min, intraoperative bleeding was 141.2 ± 24.9 (130-160) mL, and the number of resected lymph nodes was 23 ± 8 (14-33). After surgery, there was one case of anastomotic leakage and one case of anastomotic stenosis, but both were alleviated with conservative treatment. The mean duration of follow-up was 15 (4-33) months. There was no significant difference in postoperative complications of and short-term oncologic prognosis for the 20 patients who underwent hand-sewn esophagojejunostomy and the 21 patients who underwent mechanical esophagojejunostomy during the same period. In conclusion, the "China stitch", a novel hand-sewn technique, is a cost-effective, safe, and reliable method for esophagojejunostomy in totally laparoscopic total gastrectomy.
