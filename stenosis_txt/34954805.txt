Title: Epicardial fat volume is associated with preexisting atrioventricular conduction abnormalities and increased pacemaker implantation rate in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Epicardial fat tissue (EFT) is a highly metabolically active fat depot surrounding the heart and coronary arteries that is related to early atherosclerosis and adverse cardiac events. We aimed to investigate the relationship between the amount of EFT and preexisting cardiac conduction abnormalities (CCAs) and the need for new postinterventional pacemaker in patients with severe aortic stenosis planned for transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). A total of 560 consecutive patients (54% female) scheduled for TAVI were included in this retrospective study. EFT volume was measured via a fully automated artificial intelligence software (QFAT) using computed tomography (CT) performed before TAVI. Baseline CCAs [first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left bundle branch block (LBBB)] were diagnosed according to 12-lead ECG before TAVI. Aortic valve calcification was determined by the Agatston score assessed in the pre-TAVI CT. The median EFT volume was 129.5 ml [IQR 94-170]. Baseline first-degree AV block was present in 17%, RBBB in 10.4%, and LBBB in 10.2% of the overall cohort. In adjusted logistic regression analysis, higher EFT volume was associated with first-degree AV block (OR 1.006 [95% CI 1.002-1.010]; p = 0.006) and the need for new pacemaker implantation after TAVI (OR 1.005 [95% CI 1.0-1.01]; p = 0.035) but not with the presence of RBBB or LBBB. EFT volume did not correlate with the Agatston score of the aortic valve. Greater EFT volume is associated independently with preexisting first-degree AV block and new pacemaker implantation in patients undergoing TAVI. It may play a causative role in degenerative processes and the susceptibility of the AV conduction system.
