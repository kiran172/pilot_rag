Title: Transcatheter Balloon-Expandable Valve-in-Valve to Treat Severe Paravalvular Leak Secondary to ACURATE-neo Self-expanding Prosthesis-Annulus Mismatch.

Abstract: A 75-year-old male with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a Large (27-mm) ACURATE-neo transcatheter aortic valve, complicated by severe paravalvular leak. He developed rapid and progressive worsening heart failure. Reanalysis of the computed tomography images suggested evidence of prosthesis-annulus mismatch. Therefore, a redo transcatheter aortic valve implantation utilizing a 29-mm SAPIEN 3 transcatheter aortic valve was performed. This case illustrates the importance of proper valve sizing to avoid paravalvular leak, and how to safely cross an ACURATE-neo valve to avoid catheter entangling.
