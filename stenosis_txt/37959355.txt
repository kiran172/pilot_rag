Title: Combining Minimally Invasive Direct Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting with Transapical Aortic Valve Implantation-The Next Level Heart Team Approach.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: We present the results of a combined approach for transapical aortic valve replacement and minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting (taTAVI-MIDCAB) in patients with combined aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease.
BACKGROUND: For patients presenting with aortic stenosis and coronary artery disease, a simultaneous procedure addressing both diseases is recommended to reduce operative risk. In high-risk patients with hostile femoral or coronary axis, taTAVI-MIDCAB can be an alternative minimally invasive approach, offering the benefits of left interior mammary artery to left anterior descending coronary artery (LIMA-LAD) grafting.
METHODS: From 2014 to 2022, 10 patients underwent taTAVI-MIDCAB for combined coronary and severe aortic stenosis in the hybrid operation theater at our institution. We assessed perioperative outcomes and follow-up outcomes.
RESULTS: The median age was 83 years (81 to 86). The procedure was successfully performed in all patients without conversion to sternotomy. The median length of hospital and intensive care unit stay was 9 days (7 to 16) and 2.5 days (1 to 5), respectively. The median flow over the coronary artery bypass was 31 (22 to 44) mL/min, with a pulsatility index (PI) of 2.4 (2.1 to 3.2). Mild paravalvular leak occurred in 2 patients (10%). There were no neurological events nor acute kidney injury. Pacemaker implantation was required in 1 patient (10%).
CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous surgical coronary revascularization and interventional valve implantation in the setting of a hostile femoral and coronary axis appears to be safe and beneficial.
