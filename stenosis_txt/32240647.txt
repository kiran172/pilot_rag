Title: Mitral Valve Repair in Children Below Age 10 Years: Trouble or Success?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Mitral valve (MV) repair in children is challenging because of the broad spectrum of lesions and anticipated patient growth. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome of MV repair in children below 10 years of age.
METHODS: We reviewed all MV repair procedures performed in children below 10 years of age. Endpoints of the study were survival after MV repair and cumulative incidence of reoperation.
RESULTS: MV repair was performed in 40 patients with congenital MV disease (MVD) and in 10 patients with acquired MVD. Median age at time of repair for congenital MVD was 1.2 years (range, 14 days to 9.8 years) and for acquired MVD 1.9 years (range, 10 days to 9.9 years). Indication for MV repair was mitral regurgitation in 31 congenital MVD patients (77.5%) and in all acquired MVD patients. In patients with congenital MVD operative mortality was 5% and late mortality was 10%. No deaths occurred in patients with acquired MVD. Patients with congenital mitral regurgitation showed a better, yet not significant, 6-year survival than patients with congenital mitral stenosis (85.3% ± 8.2% vs 60% ± 18.2%, P = .1). In patients with congenital MVD cumulative incidence of reoperation at 6 years was 38.6% ± 8.3%.
CONCLUSIONS: In children below 10 years of age, MV repair is an effective treatment option for MVD. However it often just delays the time to valve replacement.
