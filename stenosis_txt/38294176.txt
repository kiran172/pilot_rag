Title: Usage of rotational atherectomy and drug-coated balloon angioplasty for isolated popliteal artery lesions: two-year results of a retrospective study.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: In this study, perioperative properties and early and mid-term clinical outcomes of endovascular revascularization with a combined usage of rotational atherectomy (RA) and drug-coated balloon angioplasty (DCB) angioplasty for isolated popliteal artery lesion were reported.
METHODS: A total of 28 patients with isolated popliteal artery stenosis who underwent combined RA and DCB angioplasty between December 2018 and September 2022 were analyzed retrospectively. Temren atherectomy system (Invamed, Ankara, Turkey) and Extender paclitaxel-coated drug-coated balloon catheter (Invamed, Ankara, Turkey) were used in all cases. The main outcome was primary patency; secondary outcomes were technical success, freedom from amputation, and mortality.
RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 64.2 ± 9.1 years and the majority of the patients were male (n = 20; 71.4%). Types of the lesions were total occlusion in 24 limbs and critical stenosis in 4 limbs. The mean total occlusion length was 65.2 ± 14.2 mm. Flow-limiting dissection was seen in lesions of 2 patients (7.1%) and treated with prolonged balloon dilatation without bail-out stenting requirement. Technical success defined as an adequate vascular lumen (less than 30% stenosis) was achieved in 26 (92.8%) with a mean follow-up of 17.2 ± 8.2 months. The mean primary patency rates at 12 months and 24 months were 92.3% ± 3.2 and 81.2% ± 3.2, respectively. Complications included 1 distal embolization following RA, 2 flow-limiting dissections, and 3 puncture site hematomas.
CONCLUSIONS: Endovascular procedures using combined RA and DCB angioplasty seem to be effective alternative treatment modalities for the treatment of popliteal artery lesions with high rates of primary patency and freedom from TLR.
