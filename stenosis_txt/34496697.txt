Title: Combined high-resolution 3D CUBE T1-weighted imaging and non-contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance venography for evaluation of vein stenosis in May-Thurner syndrome.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To explore the feasibility of high-resolution MRI 3-dimensional (3D) CUBE T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in combination with non-contrast-enhanced (NCE) magnetic resonance venography (MRV) for the assessment of lumen stenosis in May-Thurner syndrome.
METHODS: Twenty-nine patients underwent computed tomography venography (CTV) and high-resolution MRI-CUBE T1, and NCE MRV acquisitions. ANOVA and LSD tests were used to compare the stenosis rate and narrowest and distal diameters of the vessel lumen.
RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the estimated stenosis rate between CTV, CUBE T1, and NCE MRV (p = 0.768). However, there were significant differences in the measured stenosis diameters of the left common iliac vein (LCIV), with CTV giving the largest mean diameter and CUBE had the smallest mean diameter (p < 0.05). The measured normal LCIV diameters did not significantly differ between MRV and CUBE (p = 0.075) but were significantly larger on CTV than on MRV and CUBE (p < 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with CTV, a combination of CUBE and MRV could provide an improved assessment of the degree of lumen stenosis in May-Thurner syndrome and demonstrate acute thrombosis. MRI underestimates the diameter of the vessel in comparison with CTV. MRI can be a substitute tool for Duplex ultrasound and CTV.
