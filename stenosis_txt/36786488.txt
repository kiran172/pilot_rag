Title: Intraplaque wiring enables drug-coated balloons to be utilized for percutaneous recanalization of chronically occluded coronary arteries.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine whether drug-coated balloon (DCB) angioplasty following intraplaque wiring and the use of modified balloons is safe and effective in the percutaneous treatment of coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs).
BACKGROUND: DCB is an alternative therapeutic option without the limitations of permanent vascular implants. However, its efficacy in CTOs has yet to be confirmed. The combination of modified balloons and DCB can be effectively applied when the intraplaque passage of the guidewire is achieved in CTOs.
METHODS: Data from 124 consecutive CTO lesions (105 patients) treated at our hospital between February 2016 and December 2020 were screened for inclusion and retrospectively analyzed. Among the 118 lesions successfully recanalized, intraplaque wiring was achieved in 108, and 85 were treated by the DCB-only approach following cutting/scoring balloon dilatation.
RESULTS: Follow-up data were available for 82 lesions (71 patients). The median occlusion length was 18.5 mm, and the J-CTO score was 1.7 ± 0.9. No in-hospital major adverse cardiac events occurred, including abrupt vessel closure. During the median 29-month follow-up period, target lesion revascularization was performed for 10 lesions. Follow-up coronary angiography (8.7 ± 3.9 months after the index procedure) was performed for 64 lesions, demonstrating late lumen loss of -0.15 mm (interquartile range -0.4 to 0.23 mm), binary restenosis (diameter stenosis ≥50%) in 12 lesions (18.8%), and late lumen enlargement in 37 (57.8%).
CONCLUSION: The DCB-only approach following the use of modified balloons is a promising strategy for coronary CTOs when intraplaque wiring is achieved.
