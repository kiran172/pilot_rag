Title: CharActeristics, sizing anD outcomes of stenotic, tapered, rapHe-type bicuspid aOrtic valves treated with trans-catheter device implantation: Insights the AD HOC registry.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Raphe-type bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a potential hostile scenario in trans-catheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) due to pronounced calcium burden, possibly associated with tapered valve configuration. Trans-Catheter heart valve (THV) sizing strategy (annular vs. supra-annular) is controversial in this valve subtype.
OBJECTIVES: To describe the phenotypical characteristics of severe, tapered, raphe-type, BAV stenosis undergoing TAVR and to explore safety and efficacy of modern-generation THVs, analysing the impact of annular and supra-annular sizing strategies on short- and mid-terms outcomes.
METHODS: This is a retrospective, multicenter registry enrolling consecutive stenotic Sievers type 1 BAV treated with TAVR. Study population was divided into tapered and non-tapered configuration according to MSCT analysis. Matched comparison between annular and supra-annular sizing groups was performed in tapered population.
RESULTS: From January 2016 to June 2023, 897 patients were enrolled. Of them, 696 patients displayed a tapered configuration. Of those, 510 received a THV according to annular sizing. After propensity score matching 186 matched pairs were selected. Technical success (96.2 % vs 94.1 %, OR 1.61 [0.61-4.24], p = 0.34), 30-day device success (83.6 % in both groups, OR 1.42 [0.78-2.57], p = 0.25) and 30-day early safety (71.8 % vs 70.5 %, OR 1.07 [0.68-1.68], p = 0.78) were similar between the annular and supra-annular sizing groups; a higher post-TAVR gradient was observed in supra-annular group, although it was only 2 mmHg mean. At mid-term follow-up, the rate of clinical efficacy was 84.7 %.
CONCLUSIONS: TAVR with modern-generation devices is safe and effective for tapered raphe-type BAV, showing comparable results for annular and supra-annular sizing strategies.
