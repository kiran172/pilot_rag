Title: Association between modifiable vascular risk factors and rapid progression of postradiation carotid artery stenosis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Postradiotherapy carotid vasculopathy is a clinically relevant complication in patients with head and neck cancer receiving radiotherapy. In this study, we investigated the factors associated with the development and progression of carotid artery stenosis (CAS) in such patients.
METHODS: Patients who received radiotherapy for head and neck cancers between October 2011 and May 2019 at a medical center in Taiwan were eligible for inclusion in this study. This study included patients who underwent two consecutive carotid duplex examinations within an interval of 1 to 3 years. The factors associated with ≥50% CAS at baseline and follow-up were analyzed.
RESULTS: In total, 694 patients (mean age, 57.8 ± 9.9 years; men, 75.2%; nasopharyngeal cancer, 73.3%) were included. The mean interval between radiotherapy and carotid duplex examination was 9.9 ± 5.9 years. At baseline, 103 patients had ≥50% CAS, which was significantly associated with tobacco smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and a prolonged interval between radiotherapy and carotid duplex examination. A total of 586 patients did not have CAS at baseline; of them, 68 developed ≥50% CAS during follow-up. Hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were identified as independent risk factors for CAS progression.
CONCLUSION: Modifiable vascular risk factors, such as hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, appear to be significantly associated with the rapid progression of postradiotherapy CAS in patients with head and neck cancer.
