Title: Ultrasound-Guided Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangioscopic Lithotripsy for the Treatment of Common Bile Duct Stones and Analysis of Risk Factors for Recurrence.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: As a minimally invasive treatment for common bile duct (CBD) stones, ultrasound-guided percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy (PTCSL) is gaining attention and recognition from the medical community.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on patients with CBD stones treated in our hospital from January 2016 to April 2022. Patients were divided into three groups: 77 treated with PTCSL, 93 with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and 103 with laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE). Their clinical data, perioperative indicators, and complications were analyzed comparatively. Then, risk factors for the post-PTCSL recurrence of CBD stones were analyzed by logistic regressions. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic curve was drawn.
RESULTS: All perioperative indicators of the PTCSL group were better than the LCBDE group (P < 0.001). The incidences of cholangitis, hemobilia, and incisional infection after surgery were lower in the PTCSL group than in the LCBDE group (P < 0.05). Pancreatitis, reflux esophagitis, and papillary stenosis occurred less frequently in the PTCSL group than in the ERCP group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that gallstones and family history were independent risk factors. The AUC for recurrent CBD stones predicted by multi-indicators was 0.895 (95% CI 0.792-0.999, P < 0.001) with a sensitivity of 96.7% and specificity of 68.8%.
CONCLUSIONS: Ultrasound-guided PTCSL is a safe and effective treatment for CBD stones. Patients recovered quickly with fewer postoperative complications. It can be a first-line treatment for CBD stones. Gallstones and family history are independent risk factors for recurrent CBD stones, which provide a reference for clinicians in identifying the high-risk population needing close follow-up.
