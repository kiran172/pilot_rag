Title: Simultaneous Transcatheter Double Valve Treatment of Mediastinal Radiation-Induced Severe Calcific Aortic and Mitral Stenosis.

Abstract: Mediastinal radiation-induced severe calcific valve disease carries increased operative mortality. Transcatheter therapies are also challenging and potentially hazardous. We used a unique constellation of imaging and planning technologies to successfully plan, simulate, and perform novel combined transcatheter aortic valve replacement and valve in mitral annular calcification in a high-risk patient. (Level of Difficulty: Advanced.).
