Title: [Endoscopic lumbar surgery].

Abstract: Spinal endoscopy is the result of an evolution of techniques and technologies in the service of an ever less invasive surgery. It allows the treatment of a large range of pathologies such as disc herniation or spinal stenosis and this range continues to increase. It has already proven its non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness compared to microsurgery despite a difficult learning curve. It has the potential to replace the microscopic «gold standard» as it allows a faster recovery for the patient and a shorter hospital stay.
