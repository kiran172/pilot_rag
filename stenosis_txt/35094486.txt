Title: Use of the Medtronic Microvascular Plug 7Q for transcatheter closure of large patent ductus arteriosus in infants weighing less than 2.5 kg.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The sole Food and Drug Administration-approved device for transcatheter closure of the patent arterial duct in premature infants is indicated for patent ductus arteriosus (PDAs) ≤ 4 mm in diameter. We report a two-center experience with transcatheter closure of large PDAs (>4 mm) in infants weighing <2.5 kg using the Microvascular Plug 7Q (MVP-7Q) device.
METHODS: This is a retrospective review of departmental databases and medical charts to define patient cohort and report demographic, procedural, and follow-up data.
RESULTS: Twenty-two patients (12 male) with a median gestational age and birthweight of 25.5 weeks (interquartile range [IQR] = 24-28) and 800 g (572-1075), respectively, underwent attempted PDA occlusion with the MVP-7Q using a transvenous approach. The median age and weight at the time of PDA occlusion was 32 days (IQR = 24-28) and 1100 g (IQR = 960-1700), respectively. The median PDA length was 12 mm (IQR = 11-12.65). The median PDA diameters at the aortic and pulmonary ends were 5.1 (IQR = 4.9-5.5) and 4.8 mm (IQR = 4.6-5.3), respectively. Successful device occlusion was achieved in 20 patients (91%). There were two failed attempts: One due to inappropriate sizing, and the other secondary to left pulmonary artery stenosis. There were no procedural complications and no residual shunting on follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS: The MVP-7Q is safe and effective for transcatheter closure of large (>4 mm) PDAs in infants <2.5 kg. The lack of retention disks may help with avoiding impingement on surrounding vessels.
