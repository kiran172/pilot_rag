Title: High- versus low-gradient aortic stenosis: Is our evaluation limited by aorto-mitral angle on cardiovascular CT?

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of aortic valve (AV) stenosis (AS) on transthoracic echocardiogram is crucial for appropriate clinical management. However, discordance between aortic valve area (AVA) and Doppler can complicate the diagnosis of severe AS in low-gradient (LG) AS phenotypes.
METHODS: We reviewed 220 consecutive patients with suspected severe AS and AVA ≤1.0 cm2 on transthoracic echocardiogram who were evaluated for transcatheter AV replacement (TAVR) within a large health system from 2015 to 2019. We compared AV calcium score and aorto-mitral angle (AMA) on 3-chamber views from ECG-gated cardiovascular CT among patients with high-gradient (HG) AS (N = 19), paradoxical low-flow low-gradient (PLFLG) AS (N = 24) and normal-flow low-gradient (NFLG) AS (N = 14).
RESULTS: All groups had comparable age, comorbidities, and AV calcium scores. Compared to patients with HG AS (mean AMA 120 ± 10°), those with PLFLG AS (104 ± 12°; p < 0.001) and NFLG AS (106 ± 13°; p = 0.008) had narrower mean AMA values on cardiovascular CT.
CONCLUSION: LG AS patients have significantly narrower AMA than HG AS patients on cardiovascular CT. Due to difficulty obtaining parallel Doppler alignment, narrower AMA may contribute to AVA-Doppler discordance on echocardiogram. These findings emphasize the need for additional information in the setting of LG AS.
