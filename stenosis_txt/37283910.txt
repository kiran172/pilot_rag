Title: Transcatheter aortic valve implantation for aortic valve stenosis 17 years after aortic root remodeling via the Yacoub method.

Abstract: UNLABELLED: Yacoub operation, aimed at valve-sparing aortic root replacement, is performed to treat aortic root aneurysm with aortic regurgitation. Here we first report a successful transcatheter aortic valve implantation with a balloon-expandable prosthetic valve in an elderly patient having severe aortic valve stenosis and a small sinus of Valsalva 17 years after the Yacoub operation.
LEARNING OBJECTIVES: In transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for aortic valve stenosis with a small sinus of Valsalva post-Yacoub operation, the use of a balloon-expandable prosthetic valve may be desirable for the TAVI; a detailed analysis of the anatomy of the valve-sparing aortic root with computed tomography is essential for the valve selection.
