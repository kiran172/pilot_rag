Title: Stent Diameter, Not Cephalic Arch Anatomy, Predicts Stent Graft Patency in Cephalic Arch Stenosis.

Abstract: PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between anatomic factors and primary patency of brachiocephalic arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) after stent graft (SG) placement for cephalic arch stenosis (CAS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviewed all cephalic arch SGs placed in brachiocephalic AVFs in a tertiary academic medical center between 2014 and 2017. Sixty-three patients were included in the study. The mean patient age at the time of SG placement was 62.6 years ± 19, and the mean patient follow-up was 1,994 days ± 353. A cohort of patients (n = 31) who underwent brachiocephalic fistulograms for CAS but only received percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) was the control group. Patient demographic characteristics, AVF anatomy, SG type, and clinical outcomes were reviewed. The duration of primary cephalic arch patency after SG placement was compared with that after previous PTA.
RESULTS: The median AVF age at the time of data retrieval was 345 days. The primary patency of CAS after SG placement at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 years was 64%, 49.9%, and 23.5%, respectively. Primary cephalic arch patency was significantly associated with the SG diameter (P = .007) but not with cephalic vein-axillary vein junction anatomy, size of feeding artery, or SG length (P > .05). The primary patency of CAS in patients treated with PTA only (n = 31) at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 years was 61%, 35%, and 0%, respectively, which was significantly lower than that in patients treated with SG placement (P = .01).
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the primary patency of CAS after SG placement was significantly higher than that of PTA-only treatment. Moreover, primary cephalic arch patency after SG placement was significantly associated with the SG diameter.
