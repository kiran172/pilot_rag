Title: Successful treatment of focal renal artery fibromuscular dysplasia by balloon dilatation demonstrated via fractional flow reserve.

Abstract: We present a rare case of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) manifesting in the mid segment of right renal artery, which led to the development of refractory hypertension. The patient received balloon angioplasty to a severe lesion on the middle of right renal artery and subsequently had normalisation of blood pressures. Fractional flow reserve (FFR) detection of the renal artery before and after balloon dilatation was 0.71 and 0.98, respectively. The patient showed renal artery stenosis (RAS) with distal tumour-like dilatation, and multiple tortuosity and stenosis in carotid artery and coronary artery. At follow-up 2 months later, her blood pressures had normalised.
