Title: Outcomes of transcatheter aortic valve replacement in patients with history of chest wall irradiation: Propensity matched analysis of five years data from national inpatient sample (2016-2020).

Abstract: INTRODUCTION: Chest radiotherapy has been utilized to treat intra-thoracic and mediastinal tumors. Chest wall irradiation (C-XRT) survivors frequently develop valvular disease, including aortic stenosis, which eventually requires valve replacement. Previous trials have shown worse outcomes with surgical aortic valve replacement. However, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) outcomes-related data in patients with C-XRT is limited.
METHODS: The national inpatient sample (NIS) database was queried from 2016 to 2020 to identify adult hospitalizations with TAVR, which were dichotomized based on a history of C-XRT using ICD-10-CM codes. Propensity score matching was performed to derive age, sex, hospital characteristics, and co-morbidities matched controls without a history of C-XRT. The outcomes studied were inpatient mortality and complications, mean length of stay (LOS), and total hospital charge (THC). Multivariate logistic and linear regression were used to analyze the outcomes.
RESULTS: Of 296,670 patients who underwent TAVR between 2016 and 2020, 515 had a history of C-XRT. Upon propensity score matching in patients undergoing TAVR, Patients with a history of C-XRT showed significantly lower adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odd ratio [aOR] 0.04, 95 % CI [0.003-0.57], p = 0.017), lower mean LOS by 1.6 days (-1.88 to -1.26 days, p < 0.001) and reduced mean THC (-$74,720, [-$88,784 to -$60,655], p < 0.001). Additionally, patients with C-XRT had significantly lower adjusted odds of inpatient complications, mainly acute myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular events, acute respiratory failure, acute kidney injury, need for vasopressors and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, whereas similar odds of complications, including a requirement of intubation, mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and cardiogenic shock.
CONCLUSION: Our analysis showed reduced adjusted odds of in-hospital mortality, length of stay, total hospital charges, and inpatient complications in patients undergoing TAVR with a history of C-XRT. TAVR appears to be a safe and viable alternative in this population subgroup.
