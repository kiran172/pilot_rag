Title: Diagnostic accuracy of probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy and tissue sampling by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography in indeterminate biliary strictures: a meta‑analysis.

Abstract: Probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy (pCLE), also known as optical biopsy, is a new endoscopic technique that provides real-time magnification of 1000 × microscopic tissue information to diagnose indeterminate biliary strictures. Tissue sampling by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is routinely performed to evaluate indeterminate biliary strictures. To evaluate the accuracy of pCLE and tissue sampling by ERCP in the diagnosis of indeterminate biliary strictures, 18 articles were included from 2008 to 2021 through Embase, PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane library databases. The summary estimates for the pCLE diagnosis of indeterminate biliary strictures were: sensitivity 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.84-0.91); specificity 0.79 (95% CI 0.74-0.83); and Diagnostic Odds Ratio (DOR) 24.63 (95% CI 15.76-38.48). The summary estimates for tissue sampling by ERCP diagnosis for indeterminate biliary strictures were: sensitivity 0.54 (95% CI 0.49-0.59); specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.94-0.98); and DOR 11.31 (95% CI 3.90-32.82). The area under the sROC curve of pCLE diagnosis of indeterminate biliary strictures is 0.90 higher than 0.65 of tissue sampling by ERCP. The pCLE is a better approach than tissue sampling by ERCP for the diagnosis of indeterminate biliary strictures by providing real-time microscopic images of the bile ducts.
