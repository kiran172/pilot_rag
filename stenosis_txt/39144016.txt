Title: The relationship between intracranial atherosclerosis and white matter hyperintensity in ischemic stroke patients: a retrospective cross-sectional study using high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Both intracranial atherosclerosis and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) are prevalent among the stroke population. However, the relationship between intracranial atherosclerosis and WMH has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the characteristics of intracranial atherosclerotic plaques and the severity of WMH in patients with ischemic stroke using high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging.
METHODS: Patients hospitalized with ischemic stroke and concurrent intracranial atherosclerosis at Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, a tertiary comprehensive stroke center, who underwent high-resolution magnetic resonance vessel wall imaging and conventional brain magnetic resonance imaging were continuously recruited from January 2018 to December 2018. Both intracranial plaque characteristics (plaque number, maximum wall thickness, luminal stenosis, T1 hyperintensity, and plaque length) and WMH severity (Fazekas score and volume) were evaluated. Spearman correlation or point-biserial correlation analysis was used to determine the association between clinical characteristics and WMH volume. The independent association between intracranial plaque characteristics and the severity as well as WMH score was analyzed using logistic regression. The associations of intracranial plaque characteristics with total white matter hyperintensity (TWMH) volume, periventricular white matter hyperintensity (PWMH) volume and deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) volume were determined using multilevel mixed-effects linear regression.
RESULTS: A total of 159 subjects (mean age: 64.0±12.5 years; 103 males) were included into analysis. Spearman correlation analysis indicated that age was associated with TWMH volume (r=0.529, P<0.001), PWMH volume (r=0.523, P<0.001) and DWMH volume (r=0.515, P<0.001). Point-biserial correlation analysis indicated that smoking (r=-0.183, P=0.021) and hypertension (r=0.159, P=0.045) were associated with DWMH volume. After adjusting for confounding factors, logistic regression analysis showed plaque number was significantly associated with the presence of severe WMH [odds ratio (OR), 1.590; 95% CI, 1.241-2.035, P<0.001], PWMH score of 3 (OR, 1.726; 95% CI, 1.074-2.775, P=0.024), and DWMH score of 2 (OR, 1.561; 95% CI, 1.150-2.118, P=0.004). Intracranial artery luminal stenosis was associated with presence of severe WMH (OR, 1.032; 95% CI, 1.002-1.064, P=0.039) and PWMH score of 2 (OR, 1.057; 95% CI, 1.008-1.109, P=0.023). Multilevel mixed-effects linear regression analysis showed that plaque number was associated with DWMH volume (β=0.128; 95% CI, 0.016-0.240; P=0.026) after adjusted for age and sex.
CONCLUSIONS: In ischemic stroke patients, intracranial atherosclerotic plaque characteristics as measured by plaque number and luminal stenosis were associated with WMH burden.
