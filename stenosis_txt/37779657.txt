Title: Hemolytic Anemia Occurring 14 Years after Ascending Aortic Replacement for Acute Type A Aortic Dissection Due to Aortic Pseudoaneurysm Derived from Anastomotic Leakage: A Case Report.

Abstract: A 64-year-old male patient who presented with symptoms indicative of hemolytic anemia was referred to our hospital. After obtaining the patient's history, it was found that hemolysis occurred 14 years after he underwent ascending aortic replacement for acute type A aortic dissection. Enhanced computed tomography revealed an aortic pseudoaneurysm at the proximal anastomosis, which was thought to be the cause of hemolysis. Furthermore, aortic valve regurgitation and dilatation of the sinus of Valsalva were also found on a transthoracic echocardiogram. Therefore, the Bentall procedure was performed. During the surgery, aortic pseudoaneurysm formation and vascular graft stenosis were observed. The postoperative course was uneventful, and hemolysis diminished soon after the surgery.
