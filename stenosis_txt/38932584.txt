Title: Current applications, procedural and 1-year outcomes of Rotatripsy for the treatment of calcified coronary lesions.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) combined with rotational atherectomy (RA), known as Rotatripsy, is used to treat severe coronary artery calcification (CAC), though data on efficacy, midterm safety and use sequence is limited. We aimed to identify indicators for Rotatripsy use and to assess its safety and success rates, both acutely and at 1-year follow-up.
METHODS: Patients undergoing Rotatripsy for severe CAC across six centers from May 2019 to December 2023 were included. Demographic, clinical, procedural and follow-up data were collected. Efficacy endpoints included device success (delivery of the RA-burr and IVL-balloon across the target lesion and administration of therapy without related complications), technical success (TIMI 3 flow and residual stenosis <30% by quantitative coronary analysis) and procedural success [composite of technical success with absence of in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: cardiac death, myocardial infarction or target vessel revascularization). Safety endpoints comprised Rotatripsy-related complications and MACE at 1-year follow-up.
RESULTS: A total of 114 patients (75 ± 9 years, 78% male) underwent Rotatripsy for 120 lesions. In the majority of procedures RA was followed by IVL, mostly electively (n = 68, 57%) but also for balloon underexpansion (n = 37, 31%) and stent crossing failure (n = 1, 1%). Diverse and complex target lesions were addressed with an average SYNTAX score of 24.6 ± 13.0. Device, technical and procedural success were 97%, 94% and 93%, respectively. Therapy-related complications included two (2%) coronary perforations, one (1%) coronary dissection and one (1%) burr entrapment. At 1-year follow-up(present in 77(67%) patients), MACE occurred in 7(9%) cases.
CONCLUSIONS: Over a 1-year follow-up period, Rotatripsy was safe and effective, predominantly using RA electively before IVL.
