Title: Sex-Specific Differences in Upstream Cardiac Damage in Patients With Aortic Stenosis Undergoing TAVR.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Cardiac damage caused by aortic stenosis (AS) can be categorized into stages, which are associated with a progressively increasing risk of death after transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR).
OBJECTIVES: The authors investigated sex-related differences in cardiac damage among patients with symptomatic AS and the prognostic value of cardiac damage classification in women and men undergoing TAVR.
METHODS: In a prospective registry, pre-TAVR echocardiograms were used to categorize patients into 5 stages of cardiac damage caused by AS. Differences in the extent of cardiac damage were compared according to sex, and its implications on clinical outcomes after TAVR were explored.
RESULTS: Among 2,026 patients undergoing TAVR between August 2007 and June 2022 (995 [49.1%] women and 1,031 [50.9%] men), we observed sex-specific differences in the pattern of cardiac damage (women vs men; stage 0: 2.6% vs 3.1%, stage 1: 13.4% vs 10.1%, stage 2: 37.1% vs 39.5%, stage 3: 27.5% vs 15.6%, and stage 4: 19.4% vs 31.7%). There was a stepwise increase in 5-year all-cause mortality according to stage in women (HR<sub>adjusted</sub>: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.28-1.60, for linear trend) and men (HR<sub>adjusted</sub>: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.14-1.38, for linear trend). Female sex was associated with a lower 5-year mortality in early stages (stage 0, 1, or 2) but not in advanced stages (stage 3 or 4).
CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of cardiac damage secondary to AS differed by sex. In early stages of cardiac damage, women had a lower 5-year mortality than men, whereas in more advanced stages, mortality was comparable between sexes. (SwissTAVI Registry; NCT01368250).
