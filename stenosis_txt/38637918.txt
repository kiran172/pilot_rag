Title: Improvement of Postoperative Quality of Life in Patients Over 80 Years Old With Thoracic Spinal Stenosis.

Abstract: STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective comparative study was conducted to analyze the outcome of surgical and conservative treatment for patients over 80 years old with thoracic spinal stenosis (TSS).
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and efficiency of posterior spinal cord decompression surgery for over 80-year-old patients with TSS.
SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Concerned about the risk of surgery, over 80-year-old patients with TSS are usually treated conservatively, which often leads to a decline in quality of life. So far as we know, no study demonstrates the risk and benefit of spine surgery for these patients.
METHODS: Over 80 years of age who underwent dorsal decompression surgery or conservative treatment due to TSS between January 2010 and November 2020 were analyzed. Sixty-four patients who completed follow-up PROM (patient-reported outcome measure) data were collected, including the mJOA (modified Japanese Orthopedic Association score) scoring system, VAS (visual analogue scale), questionnaire-based assessment of the ODI (Oswestry disability index), BI (Barthel index), and SF-36v2 (Short Form-36v2) Health Survey. The clinical characteristics, preoperative and postoperative imaging findings, operative records, complications, and individual outcomes were analyzed.
RESULTS: Of the 64 patients, 38 underwent posterior decompression, pedicle screw fixation, and posterolateral fusion; another 26 chose conservative treatment. The baseline characteristics of the TSS patients in 2 groups show no significant differences. The clinical symptoms and imaging outcomes showed a significant improvement in the surgical group compared with the nonsurgical group, according to mJOA, VAS, ODI, BI, and SF-36v2. Cerebrospinal fluid leakage occurred in 6 patients, and transient neurological impairment occurred in 2 patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Posterior decompression surgery for over 80-year-old patients with TSS is a safe and effective treatment, it has a good clinical outcome as well as an acceptable complication rate. However, there were no obvious improvements in quality of life or pain with conservative treatment.
