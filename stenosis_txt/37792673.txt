Title: Two-devices-in-one-channel method for fractured pancreatic duct stent retrieval in a case of severe chronic pancreatitis.

Abstract: When a pancreatic plastic stent for symptomatic chronic pancreatitis breaks during its removal, severe pancreatic duct stenosis may complicate its retrieval. Takuma and colleagues report on the successful retrieval of a fragmented and displaced pancreatic plastic stent by applying the two-device-in-one-channel method using forceps and a snare.
