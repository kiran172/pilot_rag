Title: Alternative Proximal Protection Method during Carotid Artery Stenting Using Combined Transbrachial and Transradial Artery Approaches.

Abstract: Herein, we report a case of carotid artery stenting with proximal flow protection for severe stenosis of the left internal carotid artery using transbrachial and transradial artery approaches. Because an abdominal aortic aneurysm was present, we avoided the transfemoral approach. The procedure was successfully performed with a combination of an 8-Fr balloon guide catheter and microballoon catheter on separate axes. No complications such as pseudoaneurysm, thrombosis, or dissection were observed at the puncture site. The patient was discharged without complications and showed good outcomes at 3 months. This technique may offer a useful alternative for patients with severe stenosis who cannot be treated using a femoral artery approach.
