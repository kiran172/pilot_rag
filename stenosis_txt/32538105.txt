Title: Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome caused by inferior vena cava compression from a congenital diaphragmatic hernia.

Abstract: Acute Budd-Chiari syndrome is a rare condition characterised by obstruction of hepatic venous outflow. We describe the case of a 52-year-old man, with a congenital Morgagni diaphragmatic hernia, who presented with acute onset abdominal pain, shortness of breath, lactic acidosis, hyperbilirubinaemia and transaminasaemia. Computed tomography revealed strangulation of the diaphragmatic hernia and extrinsic compression of the inferior vena cava from the herniated viscera. Emergency surgery was carried out to repair the hernia with a biosynthetic mesh, with complete resolution of the Budd-Chiari syndrome.
