Title: Comparison of Clinical Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Common Femoral Thromboendarterectomy With or Without Patch Angioplasty.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: Surgical thromboendarterectomy (TEA) is the standard treatment for an occlusive lesion of the common femoral artery (CFA). However, there is limited knowledge on the need for patch angioplasty in CFA TEA. The objective of this study was to compare the peri-operative and two year results of CFA TEA with or without patch angioplasty.
METHODS: A multicentre retrospective observational study was performed at 34 Japanese centres. Comparisons were made between patients undergoing CFA TEA with or without patch angioplasty after propensity score matching (PSM). The primary endpoints were primary patency and freedom from target lesion revascularisation (TLR) of the TEA lesion. The secondary endpoints were hospital outcomes, limb salvage, and overall survival.
RESULTS: Between 2018 and 2020, 428 TEA procedures (237 with patch angioplasty and 191 with primary closure) were performed. PSM extracted 151 pairs with no significant intergroup differences in baseline characteristics. Peri-operative death and complications occurred in 0.7% vs. 1.3% (p = 1.0) and 6.0% vs. 6.6% (p = 1.0), respectively. The follow up rate was 96% over a median follow up of 14.9 months (interquartile range 8.3, 24.3). Loss of primary patency occurred in 18 patients. The two year primary patency of patch angioplasty cases was statistically significantly higher than that of primary closure cases (97.0% vs. 89.9%; p = .021). TLR was performed in 14 patients. The two year freedom from TLR in patch angioplasty cases was also statistically significantly higher than in primary closure cases (98.6% vs. 92.9%; p = .003). During follow up, seven limbs required major amputation and 40 patients died. There was no statistically significant difference in limb salvage and survival between the two groups after PSM.
CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report to show that patch angioplasty may decrease re-stenosis and target lesion revascularisation of CFA TEA lesions.
