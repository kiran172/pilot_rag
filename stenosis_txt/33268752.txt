Title: [Spleen Infarction after Direct Aortic Access for Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement;Report of a Case].

Abstract: Transcatheter aortic valve replacement(TAVR) in the treatment of patients with severe aortic valve stenosis (AS) has evolved on the basis of evidence from clinical trials. A 84-year-old woman with a complaint of dyspnea was diagnosed with severe AS. A preoperative computed tomography (CT) revealed huge mural thrombus at descending aorta, therefore we planned direct aortic access for TAVR to avoid embolism. Transesophageal echocardiography revealed fluttering echogram at left ventricular outflow tract. After TAVR the fluttering echogram disappeared. A postoperative CT revealed spleen infarction. In such cases, we should keep in mind that surgical AVR can be a treatment option.
