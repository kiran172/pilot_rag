Title: Sex Differences in Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography-Derived Fractional Flow Reserve: Lessons From ADVANCE.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: This study is to determine the management and clinical outcomes of patients investigated with coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR<sub>CT</sub>) according to sex.
BACKGROUND: Women are underdiagnosed with conventional ischemia testing, have lower rates of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) at invasive coronary angiography (ICA), yet higher mortality compared to men. Whether FFR<sub>CT</sub> improves sex-based patient management decisions compared to CCTA alone is unknown.
METHODS: Subjects with symptoms and CAD on CCTA were enrolled (2015 to 2017). Demographics, symptom status, CCTA anatomy, coronary volume to myocardial mass ratio (V/M), lowest FFR<sub>CT</sub> values, and management plans were captured. Endpoints included reclassification rate between CCTA and FFR<sub>CT</sub> management plans, incidence of ICA demonstrating obstructive CAD (≥50% stenosis) and revascularization rates.
RESULTS: A total of 4,737 patients (n = 1,603 females, 33.8%) underwent CCTA and FFR<sub>CT</sub>. Women were older (age 68 ± 10 years vs. 65 ± 10 years; p &lt; 0.0001) with more atypical symptoms (41.5% vs. 33.9%; p &lt; 0.0001). Women had less obstructive CAD (65.4% vs. 74.7%; p &lt; 0.0001) at CCTA, higher FFR<sub>CT</sub> (0.76 ± 0.10 vs. 0.73 ± 0.10; p &lt; 0.0001), and lower likelihood of positive FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤ 0.80 for the same degree stenosis (p &lt; 0.0001). A positive FFR<sub>CT</sub> ≤0.80 resulted in equal referral to ICA (n = 510 [54.5%] vs. n = 1,249 [56.5%]; p = 0.31), but more nonobstructive CAD (n = 208 [32.1%] vs. n = 354 [24.5%]; p = 0.0003) and less revascularization (n = 294 [31.4%] vs. n = 800 [36.2%]; p &lt; 0.0001) in women, unless the FFR<sub>CT</sub> was ≤0.75 where revascularization rates were similar (n = 253 [41.9%] vs. n = 715 [46.4%]; p = 0.06). Women have a higher V/M ratio (26.17 ± 7.58 mm3/g vs. 24.76 ± 7.22 mm3/g; p &lt; 0.0001) that is associated with higher FFR<sub>CT</sub> independent of degree stenosis (p &lt; 0.001). Predictors of revascularization included stenosis severity, FFR<sub>CT,</sub> symptoms, and V/M ratio (p &lt; 0.001) but not female sex (p = 0.284).
CONCLUSIONS: FFR<sub>CT</sub> differs between the sexes, as women have a higher FFR<sub>CT</sub> for the same degree of stenosis. In FFR<sub>CT</sub>-positive CAD, women have less obstructive CAD at ICA and less revascularization, which is associated with higher V/M ratio. The findings suggest that CAD and FFR<sub>CT</sub> variations by sex need specific interpretation as these differences may affect therapeutic decision making and clinical outcomes.
