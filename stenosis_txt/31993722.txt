Title: One-Step Multichannel Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangioscopic Lithotripsy Applied in Bilateral Hepatolithiasis.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the outcomes of one-step multichannel percutaneous transhepatic cholangioscopic lithotripsy (PTCSL) with traditional PTCSL in the treatment of bilateral hepatolithiasis.
METHODS: From February 2011 to June 2015, 156 patients with bilateral hepatolithiasis received surgical treatment in our department. Among these patients, 81 received one-step multichannel PTCSL (group A), and the remaining 75 received traditional PTCSL (group B).
RESULTS: Compared with group B, group A was characterized by a significantly shorter operation time (83.7 ± 28.5 min vs 118.1 ± 41.5 min; P = 0.000), hospital stay (11.1 ± 3.4 d vs 17.8 ± 5.6 d; P = 0.034), and postoperative hospital stay (6.9 ± 3.1 d vs 9.6 ± 4.5 d; P = 0.026). In addition, the immediate clearance (62.9% vs 45.3%, P = 0.027) and final clearance (90.1% vs 78.7%, P = 0.048) rates were higher in group A than in group B. During the follow-up period, stone recurrence was significantly less common in group A than in group B (13.6% vs 26.7%, P = 0.041). Multivariate Cox analysis showed that the PTCSL method (HR = 2.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.09-4.90, P = 0.028), bilateral biliary stricture (HR = 4.17, 95% CI = 1.73-10.03, P = 0.001), and stones located in segments I (HR = 7.75, 95% CI = 3.67-16.38, P = 0.000) were independent predictors of recurrence.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared with traditional PTCSL, one-step multichannel PTCSL was more efficient and effective in the treatment of bilateral hepatolithiasis.
