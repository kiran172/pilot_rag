Title: A Rabbit Aortic Valve Stenosis Model Induced by Direct Balloon Injury.

Abstract: Animal models are emerging as an important tool to understand the pathologic mechanisms underlying aortic valve stenosis (AVS) because of the lack of access to reliable sources of diseased human aortic valves. Among the various animal models, AVS rabbit models are one of the most commonly used in large animal studies. However, traditional AVS rabbit models require a long-term period of dietary supplementation and genetic manipulation to induce significant stenosis in the aortic valve, limiting their use in experimental studies. To address these limitations, a new AVS rabbit model is proposed, in which stenosis is induced by a direct balloon injury to the aortic valve. The present protocol describes a successful technique for inducing AVS in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits, with step-by-step procedures for the preparation, the surgical procedure, and the post-operative care. This simple and reproducible model offers a promising approach for studying the initiation and progression of AVS and provides a valuable tool for investigating the underlying pathological mechanisms of the disease.
