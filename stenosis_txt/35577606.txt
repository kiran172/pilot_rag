Title: Controlled long term outcome of pyloromyotomy for pyloric stenosis: No long-term adverse effect.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Pyloromyotomy for pyloric stenosis is one of the more common surgical procedures performed on infants. The long-term effects of the procedure are however unclear. The purpose of this study was to study the effects into adult life, compare them with controls and to see if there is a need for structured follow up of patients.
METHODS: Of the 101 patients operated for pyloric stenosis between 1972 and 1974 at our tertiary referral center 91 could be traced. They were all invited to participate in the study and were sent validated questionnaires (PAGI-SYM, GIQLI) as well as a study-specific questionnaire examining the use of antacid drugs, incidence of gastroscopy and abdominal surgery. Sixty patients responded (66%, mean age 45 years, 46 male) and were included. Thereafter, 600 age and sex-matched controls were sent the same questionnaires. 132 responded (22%, 90 male) and were includes as controls.
RESULTS: No significant differences could be found in any of the examined parameters when looking at the whole material or the male patients. Female patients had higher PAGI-SYM-scores for post prandial fullness (mean 1.11 vs 0.43, P = 0.035) and heartburn (mean 0.59 vs 0.14, P = 0.043) when compared to controls.
CONCLUSIONS: The present study shows that most patients operated for pyloric stenosis during infancy experience no negative effects into adulthood. The finding in the female patient group is interesting but is unlikely to have any clinical implications. The results from this study strongly implicate that there is no need for follow up of patients into adulthood.
