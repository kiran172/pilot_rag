Title: Myocardial analysis from routine 4D cardiac-CT to predict reverse remodeling and clinical outcomes after transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: PURPOSE: Our study aimed to determine whether 4D cardiac computed tomography (4DCCT) based quantitative myocardial analysis may improve risk stratification and can predict reverse remodeling (RRM) and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI).
METHODS: Consecutive patients undergoing clinically indicated 4DCCT prior to TAVI were prospectively enrolled. 4DCCT-derived left- (LV) and right ventricular (RV), and left atrial (LA) dimensions, mass, ejection fraction (EF) and myocardial strain were evaluated to predict RRM and survival. RRM was defined by either relative increase in LVEF by 5% or relative decline in LV end diastolic diameter (LVEDD) by 5% assessed by transthoracic echocardiography prior TAVI, at discharge, and at 12-month follow-up compared to baseline prior to TAVI.
RESULTS: Among 608 patients included in this study (55 % males, age 81 ± 6.6 years), RRM was observed in 279 (54 %) of 519 patients at discharge and in 218 (48 %) of 453 patients at 12-month echocardiography. While no CCT based measurements predicted RRM at discharge, CCT based LV mass index and LVEF independently predicted RRM at 12-month (OR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.012; 95 %CI:1.001-1.024; p = 0.046 and OR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.969; 95 %CI:0.943-0.996; p = 0.024, respectively). The most pronounced changes in LVEF and LVEDD were observed in patients with impaired LV function at baseline. In multivariable analysis age (HR<sub>adj</sub> = 1.037; 95 %CI:1.005-1.070; p = 0.022) and CCT-based LVEF (HR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.972; 95 %CI:0.945-0.999; p = 0.048) and LAEF (HR<sub>adj</sub> = 0.982; 95 %CI:0.968-0.996; p = 0.011) independently predicted survival.
CONCLUSION: Comprehensive myocardial functional information derived from routine 4DCCT in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing TAVI could predict reverse remodeling and clinical outcomes at 12-month following TAVI.
