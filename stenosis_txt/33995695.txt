Title: Malignant lymphoma with diffuse cardiac involvement and pulmonary stenosis.

Abstract: Lymphoma is one of the most common tumors with the risk of cardiac metastasis. The pattern of cardiac involvement is usually as focal masses. As early diagnosis of lymphoma plays a crucial role in its response to treatment and patient survival longevity, we report a rare case of cardiac lymphoma with diffuse cardiac involvement and acquired pulmonary stenosis. The patient was referred to our center for further evaluation because of dyspnea and systolic ejection murmur. In pericardial biopsy, T cell lymphoblastic lymphoma was reported. After a full course of chemotherapy and one-year follow up, symptoms had improved and echocardiography was normal except for small pericardial effusion. &lt;Learning objective: Early diagnosis of lymphoma plays a crucial role in its response to treatment and introducing atypical presentation form could be helpful for early diagnosis.&gt;.
