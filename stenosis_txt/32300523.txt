Title: A case of imatinib-related obstructive bronchiolitis followed long term.

Abstract: Obstructive bronchiolitis (OB) is an intractable disease causing stenosis in the surrounding bronchiolar region and bronchiolar lumen obstruction. Causes of OB are lung and hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, collagen diseases, infections, and foods, but there are very few reports of drug-induced OB [1]. Imatinib is a drug used for the treatment of leukemia, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, etc. Although there are some reports of imatinib-induced lung injury as a complication (Ohnishi et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2003; Yamasawa et al., 2008; Koide et al., 2011) [[2], [3], [4], [5]], OB has not been reported. We have encountered a patient with OB related to imatinib administered for chronic myelogenous leukemia, who we have followed for 10 years. Drug-induced OB is very rare, but our case demonstrates the importance of considering the possibility of airway lesions by evaluating pulmonary function and expiratory computed tomography in patients with respiratory symptoms despite no shading on imaging.
