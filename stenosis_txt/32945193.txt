Title: Clinical process optimization of transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: Background: The avoidance of prolonged hospital stay is a major goal in the management of transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) - medically and economically. Materials &amp; methods: We compared the time range of the preprocedural length of stay in 2014/2015 with 2016/2017, after the implementation of the TAVI coordinator in 2016. This included restructured pathways for screening and pre-interventional diagnosis, performed examinations during the inpatient stay and major outcome variables. Results: After 2016, we observed a significant reduction in preprocedural length of stay (admission to procedure) compared with 2014/2015 (11.3 ± 7.9 vs 7.5 ± 5.6 days, p = 0.001). There was no difference in other major outcome variables. Conclusion: The introduction of the TAVI coordinator caused a shortening of preprocedural length of stay.
