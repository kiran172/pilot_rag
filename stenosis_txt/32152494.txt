Title: Early postnatal cardiac follow-up of survivors of twin-twin transfusion syndrome treated with fetoscopic laser coagulation.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: To assess the cardiac function and prevalence of congenital heart defects (CHD) in twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) survivors.
STUDY DESIGN: Prospective follow-up of TTTS pregnancies treated with laser surgery (2015-2018). Echocardiography was performed 1 day and 1 month after birth (corrected for prematurity). Results were compared with a control group of age-matched uncomplicated monochorionic twin-pairs at 1 month.
RESULT: Eighty-nine TTTS (168 neonates) and nine control pregnancies (18 neonates) were enrolled. CHD birth prevalence was 9.2% (8/87) in recipients and 13.6% (11/81) in donors (p = 0.37). Four of 19 (21%) were detected prenatally, all pulmonary stenosis. Donors had lower aortic peak velocities compared with recipients at day 1 (0.66 ± 0.15 m/s vs 0.71 ± 0.19 m/s, p = 0.04) and 1 month (1.04 ± 0.21 m/s vs 1.11 ± 0.18 m/s, p = 0.02), but not compared with controls.
CONCLUSION: CHD prevalence in TTTS survivors is high, with a low prenatal detection of minor abnormalities. Follow-up fetal echocardiograms and a postnatal echocardiogram should be offered.
