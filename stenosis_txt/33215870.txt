Title: Prognostic value of the H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Abstract: AIMS: The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of the H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score in patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) for severe aortic stenosis (AS) and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (EF).
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this multicentre study, a total of 832 patients from two German high-volume centres, who received TAVI for severe AS and preserved EF (≥50%), were identified for calculation of the H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score. Patients were dichotomized according to low (0-5 points; n = 570) and high (6-9 points; n = 262) H<sub>2</sub> FPEF scores. Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were applied to assess the prognostic impact of the H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score. We observed a decrease in stroke volume index (-2.04 mL/m2 /point) and mean transvalvular gradients (-1.14 mmHg/point) with increasing H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score translating into a higher prevalence of paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS among patients with high H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score. One year after TAVI, the rates of all-cause (low vs. high H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score: 8.0% vs. 19.4%, P &lt; 0.0001) and cardiovascular (CV) mortality (1.9% vs. 9.0%, P &lt; 0.0001) as well as the rate of CV mortality or rehospitalization for congestive heart failure (6.4% vs. 23.2%, P &lt; 0.0001) were higher in patients with high H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score compared with those with low H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score. After multivariable analysis, a high H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score remained independently predictive of all-cause mortality [hazard ratio 1.59 (1.28-2.35), P = 0.018] and CV mortality or rehospitalization for congestive heart failure [hazard ratio 2.92 (1.65-5.15), P &lt; 0.001]. Among the H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score variables, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary hypertension, and elevated left ventricular filling pressure were the strongest outcome predictors.
CONCLUSIONS: The H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score serves as an independent predictor of adverse CV and heart failure outcome among TAVI patients with preserved EF. A high H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score is associated with the presence of paradoxical low-flow, low-gradient AS, the HFpEF in patients with AS. By identifying patients in advanced stages of HFpEF, the H<sub>2</sub> FPEF score might be useful as a risk prediction tool in patients with preserved EF scheduled for TAVI.
