Title: The diagnostic value of MRI findings in pediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a case-control study.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a rare medical condition in children. Based on the different radiological findings reported in various studies in pediatric IIH, this study was conducted to determine the diagnostic value of MRI findings in diagnosing IIH in children.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, the medical records of all children aged 1 to 18 years who visited Ghaem Hospital in Mashhad, Iran, between 2012 and 2022 and were diagnosed with IIH were gathered. Forty-nine cases of children with IIH and 48 control cases of children with the first unprovoked seizure with no indications of increased intracranial pressure for comparison were selected. Patient demographic information and MRI findings were extracted. The comparison between different MRI findings in the case and control groups was conducted using statistical tests.
RESULTS: In the case group, the mean diameter of the subarachnoid space expansion around the optic nerve was 5.96 ± 1.21, compared to 4.79 ± 0.33 in the control group, with statistically significant difference (P < 0.001). All the patients with flattening of the posterior globe or transverse sinus stenosis were in the case group, and the frequency of these findings in the case group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.001). The majority of patients (95.5%) classified under category 3 and 4 of empty sella were part of the case group, and the statistical test results indicated a significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.001). The optic nerve sheath diameter cut-off of 5.35 mm, when used for expansion of the subarachnoid space around the optic nerve, with a sensitivity of 82% and a specificity of 100% in diagnosing IIH.
CONCLUSION: The most reliable diagnostic indicators for diagnosing IIH in children are perioptic subarachnoid space expansion with high sensitivity, and posterior globe flattening and transverse sinus stenosis with high specificity.
