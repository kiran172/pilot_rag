Title: Re-Definition of the Epidemiology of Cardiac Amyloidosis.

Abstract: The epidemiology of cardiac amyloidosis (CA), traditionally considered a rare and incurable disease, has changed drastically over the last ten years, particularly due to the advances in diagnostic methods and therapeutic options in the field of transthyretin CA (ATTR-CA). On the one hand, the possibility of employing cardiac scintigraphy with bone tracers to diagnose ATTR-CA without a biopsy has unveiled the real prevalence of the disease; on the other, the emergence of effective treatments, such as tafamidis, has rendered an early and accurate diagnosis critical. Interestingly, the following subgroups of patients have been found to have a higher prevalence of CA: elderly subjects > 75 years, patients with cardiac hypertrophy hospitalized for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, subjects operated on for bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, patients with cardiac hypertrophy not explained by concomitant factors and individuals with aortic valve stenosis. Many studies investigating the prevalence of CA in these particular populations have contributed to rewriting the epidemiology of the disease, increasing the awareness of the medical community for a previously underappreciated condition. In this review, we summarized the latest evidence on the epidemiology of CA according to the different clinical settings typically associated with the disease.
