Title: Usefulness of frailty assessment using the revised Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study on the prediction of clinical outcomes in patients with severe aortic stenosis undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

Abstract: Frailty assessment is essential for deciding the treatment strategy for patients with aortic stenosis (AS) undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). Recently, the revised Japanese version of the Cardiovascular Health Study (J-CHS) criteria has been proposed for the frailty assessment; however, it is unclear whether the criteria are useful for the risk stratification in these patients. We investigated the impact of frailty assessment using the revised J-CHS criteria on clinical outcomes in patients with AS undergoing TAVR. We examined 205 consecutive severe AS patients who underwent TAVR at two tertiary hospitals from May 2018 to December 2022. Frailty was defined by the revised J-CHS criteria (score ≥ 3) before TAVR. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Among the studied patients, the mean age was 84 years and 65% were female. Frailty was present in 51% of patients. During a median follow-up period of 1000 (interquartile range 677-1210) days, MACCE occurred in 22 patients. Frailty was significantly independently associated with higher risks of the MACCE adjusted for confounders related to nutritional status, severity of AS, comorbidities [hazard ratio (HR) 5.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.70-15.23; HR 3.94, 95% CI 1.34-11.55; HR 3.12, 95% CI 1.14-8.53; HR 3.31, 95% CI 1.21-9.02, respectively]. Frailty determined by the revised J-CHS criteria was associated with clinical outcomes, suggesting these criteria would be useful for risk stratification in Japanese patients with AS undergoing TAVR.
