Title: Cardiac Computed Tomography of Native Cardiac Valves.

Abstract: Valvular heart disease (VHD) is a significant clinical problem associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although not being the primary imaging modality in VHD, cardiac computed tomography (CCT) provides relevant information about its morphology, function, severity grading, and adverse cardiac remodeling assessment. Aortic valve calcification quantification is necessary for grading severity in cases of low-flow/low-gradient aortic stenosis. Moreover, CCT details significant information necessary for adequate percutaneous treatment planning. CCT may help to detail the etiology of VHD as well as to depict other less frequent causes of valvular disease, such as infective endocarditis, valvular neoplasms, or other cardiac pseudomasses.
