Title: Association between the rs2279238 of the Liver X receptor alpha gene polymorphism and advanced carotid atherosclerosis in the Slovenian cohort.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Liver X receptor alpha (LXRA) plays important role in cholesterol and lipid homeostasis and lipid metabolism; moreover, it has been investigated as a candidate gene in a number of conditions, including onset and progression of atherosclerosis. We hypothesized that the LXRA gene rs2279238 polymorphism may be associated with the onset and progression of carotid atherosclerosis in the Slovenian cohort.
METHODS: 783 unrelated Slovenian patients were included in this cross-sectional case-control study: 308 patients in the group of cases with severe internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis (>75 %) and 475 patients with hemodynamically insignificant ICA stenosis (<50 %) in the control group. Medical records were used to acquire patient laboratory and clinical data. The TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay was used to genotype the rs2279238 polymorphism.
RESULTS: Between the case and control groups, we identified a statistically significant variation in genotype distribution (p = 0.04), but not in allele frequency (p = 0.13) of the LXRA gene polymorphism rs2279238. The results, also show that there is a statistically significant association (p = 0.04) between the two genetic models (codominant and recessive) of the LXRA gene rs2279238 polymorphism and carotid atherosclerosis.
CONCLUSION: In the Slovenian cohort, we found a significant association between the TT genotype of rs2279238 and advanced carotid artery disease, suggesting that this polymorphism might be a genetic risk factor for ICA atherosclerosis.
