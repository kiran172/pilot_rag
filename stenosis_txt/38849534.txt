Title: Effects of axial loading and positions on lumbar spinal stenosis: an MRI study using a new axial loading device.

Abstract: OBJECTIVE: A new axial loading device was used to investigate the effects of axial loading and positions on lumbar structure and lumbar spinal stenosis.
METHODS: A total of 40 patients sequentially underwent 4 examinations: (1) the psoas-relaxed position MRI, (2) the extended position MRI, (3) the psoas-relaxed position axial loading MRI, (4) the extended position axial loading MRI. The dural sac cross-sectional area, sagittal vertebral canal diameter, disc height and ligamentum flavum thickness of L3-4, L4-5, L5-S1 and lumbar lordosis angle were measured and compared. A new device with pneumatic shoulder-hip compression mode was used for axial loading.
RESULTS: In the absence of axial loading, there was a significant reduction in dural sac cross-sectional area with extension only seen at the L3-4 (p = 0.033) relative to the dural sac area in the psoas-relaxed position. However, with axial loading, there was a significant reduction in dural sac cross-sectional area at all levels in both psoas-relaxed (L3-4, p = 0.041; L5-S1, p = 0.005; L4-5, p = 0.002) and extension (p < 0.001) positions. The sagittal vertebral canal diameter and disc height were significantly reduced at all lumbar levels with axial loading and extension (p < 0.001); however, in psoas-relaxed position, the sagittal vertebral canal diameter was only reduced with axial loading at L3-4 (p = 0.018) and L4-5 (p = 0.011), and the disc height was reduced with axial-loading at all levels (L3-4, p = 0.027; L5-S1, p = 0.001; L4-5, p < 0.001). The ligamentum flavum thickness and lumbar lordosis in extension position had a statistically significant increase compared to psoas-relaxed position with or without axial loading (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Both axial loading and extension of lumbar may exacerbate lumbar spinal stenosis. Axial loading in extension position could maximally aggravate lumbar spinal stenosis, but may cause some patients intolerable. For those patients, axial loading MRI in psoas-relaxed position may be a good choice.
