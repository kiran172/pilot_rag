Title: Characteristics of Calcification and Their Association with Carotid Plaque Vulnerability.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Carotid plaque vulnerability is one of the important features for evaluating the risk of subsequent ischemic stroke. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the gold standard modality for evaluating plaque vulnerability, some patients cannot undergo MRI because of physical or economic issues. Computed tomography (CT) is more readily available. The purpose of this study was to establish a new category of calcification on CT and to assess its usefulness for detecting vulnerable plaque.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively evaluated consecutive patients who underwent plaque imaging using CT and MRI before carotid revascularization at our institute. Calcifications were classified into 4 types according to the new calcium classification. The patients were divided into 2 groups, the double layer sign (DLS)-positive group and the DLS-negative group. Signal intensity ratio (SIR) of carotid plaque was measured on MRI for evaluating plaque vulnerability and compared between type of calcification and SIR.
RESULTS: Among the 132 patients evaluated, 50 patients (62.5%) in DLS positive group and 16 patients (30.8%) in DLS negative group had calcification with vulnerable plaque (SIR > 1.47) (P < 0.01). Substantial interobserver agreement of type of calcification was observed (kappa, 0.79; P < 0.01). Multivariate analysis showed that DLS (odds ratio 3.03; 95% confidence interval 1.35-6.8; P < 0.01) and male sex (odds ratio 3.15; 95% confidence interval 1.02-9.68; P = 0.04) were independent predictors of vulnerable plaque.
CONCLUSIONS: DLS in our new classification of calcification on CT reliably detects vulnerable plaque and could thus be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI.
