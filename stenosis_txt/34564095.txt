Title: Advances in the Treatment of Gastrointestinal Bleeding: Safety and Efficiency of Transnasal Endoscopy.

Abstract: Acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) is a common disorder and a gastroenterological emergency. With the development of new techniques and devices, the survivability after gastrointestinal bleeding is improving. However, at the same time, we are facing the difficulty of severely complicated cases with various diseases. For example, while endoscopic examination with a normal diameter endoscope is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of UGIB, there are several cases in which it cannot be used. In these cases, transnasal endoscopy (TNE) may be a viable treatment option. This report reviews current hemostatic devices for endoscopic treatment and the safety and efficiency of using TNE in complicated cases. The latter will be demonstrated in a case report where TNE was employed in a patient with severe esophageal stenosis. This review summarizes the advances made in the devices used and will provide further ideas for the physician in terms of combining these devices and TNE.
