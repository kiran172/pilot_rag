Title: Transplant renal vein stent placement complicated by obstructive hematuria: A case report.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Renal vein stenosis is uncommon following transplantation. We report acute renal vein stenosis post-transplant treated with an endovascular stent and complicated by urinary obstruction from clot formation.
METHODS: Retrospective case report.
RESULTS: A 16-year-old female 3â€‰years post-transplant suffered anuria post-stenting with renal ultrasound demonstrating obstructive clot in the collecting system, a previously unreported complication. Subsequent nephroureteral JJ stent placement resulted in high-volume urine output.
CONCLUSION: This article underscores the high index of suspicion required for renal vein stenosis following transplantation and the need to monitor urine output closely following stent placement.
