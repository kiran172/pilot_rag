Title: Multimodality imaging approach in a case of vascular toxicity caused by cabozantinib.

Abstract: Vascular toxicity caused by cancer treatment can present as vasospasm, arterial thrombosis, and accelerated atherosclerosis. We report a case of a 60-year-old man with metastatic renal cell carcinoma under cabozantinib treatment for 3 years who presented to the hospital with relapsing episodes of rest angina. Due to the presence of ST depression in the 12-lead electrocardiogram and elevated troponin, a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction was suspected. The patient underwent invasive coronary angiography, which revealed extended coronary artery spasm, and it subsided totally after nitrate administration. One year later, the patient presented again at the cardio-oncology outpatient clinic, reporting relapsing episodes of angina during the previous month. Coronary computed tomography angiography was performed, and it revealed 2 subsequent 70%-99% stenosis in OM1. To our knowledge, this is the first case of a patient treated with cabozantinib presenting with coronary artery spasm and accelerated atherosclerosis, in which a multimodality imaging approach was followed.
