Title: Midterm results after seamless patch mitral reconstruction.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Some pathologies, including infective endocarditis or sclerotic changes of the mitral leaflet, make the conventional mitral valve repair challenging. Our previously described technique for reconstruction with a seamless pericardial patch makes the repair feasible in some of such difficult pathologies. However, the extent of mitral leaflet segments that could be safely repaired using this technique remains unknown. We investigated the association between the midterm outcome and the extent of mitral leaflet segments replaced by a pericardial patch.
METHODS: From January 2009 to January 2022, patients who underwent mitral valve repair with the seamless 1-patch reconstruction technique were included. The glutaraldehyde-treated pericardium was trimmed and anchored at the papillary muscle. The edge was sewn to the leaflet and the annulus.
RESULTS: A total of 49 patients (aged 60 ± 15 years) underwent mitral valve repair with this technique. The totally endoscopic approach was used in 27 patients (55%). No patient's repair was converted to valve replacement. No operative mortality or disabling stroke was observed during the early postoperative period. In the midterm follow-up, redo surgery was required in 9 patients (18%). Freedom from mitral valve reintervention rates at 1, 5, and 10 years were 84%, 82%, and 82% for all patients, respectively. Freedom from reoperation at 5 years was 100%, 92%, and 46% for commissural lesion, 1- to 2-segment involvement, and 3-segment involvement, respectively. There was a significant difference among the 3 groups with regard to mitral valve reoperation rate (P = .002).
CONCLUSIONS: Mitral valve seamless patch reconstruction provides excellent midterm results if applied to commissural lesions or lesions involving up to 2 segments.
