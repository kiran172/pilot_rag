Title: Balloon dilation strategy does not affect outcomes for transcarotid artery revascularization in prospective trials.

Abstract: OBJECTIVES: Strategies of balloon dilation during transfemoral carotid artery stenting include prestent dilation only (PRE), post-stent dilation only (POST), or both predilation and postdilation (PRE+POST). Concerns over higher neurological risk have been raised with POST and PRE+POST during transfemoral carotid artery stenting. Whether these concerns are applicable to transcarotid artery revascularization (TCAR), which uses proximal clamping and cerebral blood flow reversal during stent deployment and balloon angioplasty remains unknown. Our aim is to analyze outcomes of PRE, POST, or PRE+POST balloon dilation strategies during TCAR.
METHODS: We analyzed the prospectively collected data from the ROADSTER1 (pivotal), ROADSTER2 (US Food and Drug Administration indicated postmarket), and ROADSTER Extended Access TCAR trials. All trial patients had a high risk anatomic or clinical factors for carotid endarterectomy and were included, unless they did not undergo stent deployment or balloon dilation. For trial inclusion, asymptomatic patients had a carotid stenosis of more than 80%, and symptomatic patients had stenosis of more than 50%. Primary outcome measures were stroke, death, and myocardial infarction (MI) at 30 days. Data were statistically analyzed with χ2, analysis of variance, and multivariable analysis, as appropriate.
RESULTS: There were 851 patients (566 male) who underwent dilation by PRE (n = 216), POST (n = 249), or PRE+POST (n = 386). Patients had carotid stenosis of greater than 70% (n = 828, 97%), and 207 (24%) were symptomatic. Flow reversal times were longer in the PRE+POST group (PRE 10.2 minutes, POST 9.8 minutes, and PRE+POST 13.3 minutes; P < .001). The 30-day stroke rate for the whole cohort was 1.9%, mortality was 0.5%, and MI rate was 0.94%. Stroke rates for the PRE cohort (1.9%), POST cohort (2.0%), and PRE+POST cohort (1.8%; P = .98) were similar. Also, death rates at 30 days, and composite stroke, death, and MI rates were similar in the three cohorts. No significant differences in adverse outcomes were noted among the various dilation strategies for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on these prospective trial data, there is no difference in neurological complications owing to balloon dilation strategy during TCAR. The balloon dilation technique best suited to the patient's specific lesion morphology should be used. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship of these dilation strategies to long-term outcomes, including stent patency, restenosis, and reintervention.
