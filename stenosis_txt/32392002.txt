Title: [A male patient with postural syncope].

Abstract: A 75-year-old male with a history of CABG and aortic aneurysm was seen in the emergency department. When he lay down, he suddenly became unresponsive. ECG, thoracic X-ray and blood tests ruled out common causes of syncope. An abdominal CT scan revealed a huge renal cyst, which was compressing the inferior vena cava.
