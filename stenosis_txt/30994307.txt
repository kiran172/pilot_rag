Title: One-year outcome of the everolimus-eluting, balloon-expandable Promus Element and Promus Element Plus stent in the treatment of below-the-knee lesions in CLI patients.

Abstract: BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the balloon expandable Promus Element and Promus Element Plus stents (both Boston Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), coated with everolimus, in the treatment of short, focal infrapopliteal lesions.
METHODS: The PREVENT study was a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized, single arm study evaluating the safety and efficacy of the Promus Element and Promus Element Plus stent in the treatment of stenotic or occlusive lesions ≤40 mm long in the tibioperoneal arteries of patients with critical limb ischemia (CLI). A total of 70 study subjects were enrolled in a period of 26 months, between November 2012 and December 2014. The mean age was 77.84±6.62 years (62-90 years) and 47 patients were men (67.1%). Mean lesion length was 22.83±8.78 mm (5-40 mm). Twenty percent of the lesions were occluded, whereas 80.00% were stenotic. Primary endpoint was primary patency at 12 months, defined as absence of restenosis (≥50% stenosis) or occlusion within the originally treated lesion based on angiography. Secondary outcomes included hemodynamic primary patency on duplex ultrasound (PSV ratio ≤2.4), limb salvage and freedom from target lesion revascularization (TLR).
RESULTS: Technical and procedural success (<30% residual angiographic stenosis without major complications) was achieved in all 70 cases (100%). Primary patency was 93.8% at 6 months and 86.2% at 1 year. Freedom from TLR was 93% at 1 year. Limb salvage rate at 12-month follow-up, defined as absence of major amputation, was 100%.
CONCLUSIONS: This study shows the safety and efficacy of the everolimus-eluting, balloon expandable Promus Element and Promus Element Plus stent in the treatment of below-the-knee lesions in patients with critical limb ischemia.
