Title: Outcome Measures and Biomarkers for Disease Assessment in Takayasu Arteritis.

Abstract: Takayasu arteritis (TAK) is a less common large vessel vasculitis where histopathology of involved arteries is difficult to access except during open surgical procedures. Assessment of disease activity in TAK, therefore, relies on surrogate measures. Clinical disease activity measures such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) score, the Disease Extent Index in TAK (DEI.TAK) and the Indian TAK Clinical Activity Score (ITAS2010) inconsistently associate with acute phase reactants (APRs). Computerized tomographic angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), or color Doppler Ultrasound (CDUS) enables anatomical characterization of stenosis, dilatation, and vessel wall characteristics. Vascular wall uptake of 18-fluorodeoxyglucose or other ligands using positron emission tomography computerized tomography (PET-CT) helps assess metabolic activity, which reflects disease activity well in a subset of TAK with normal APRs. Angiographic scoring systems to quantitate the extent of vascular involvement in TAK have been developed recently. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein have a moderate performance in distinguishing active TAK. Numerous novel biomarkers are under evaluation in TAK. Limited literature suggests a better assessment of active disease by combining APRs, PET-CT, and circulating biomarkers. Validated damage indices and patient-reported outcome measures specific to TAK are lacking. Few biomarkers have been evaluated to reflect vascular damage in TAK and constitute important research agenda.
