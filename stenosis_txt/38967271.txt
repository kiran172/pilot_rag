Title: Pancreatic duct occupation method assisted wire guide through pancreatic duct stenosis in the treatment of chronic pancreatitis.

Abstract: Chronic pancreatitis is usually accompanied by pancreatic duct stenosis and pancreatic duct stones. Pancreatic duct stent implantation can effectively drain pancreatic fluid and relieve symptoms. However, in many cases this is not easy, because of the presence of stones or the pancreatic duct is too narrow, the guide wire may not be able to enter the distal pancreatic duct. We present a case of chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic duct stenosis in which we assisted the passage of guidewires through the pancreatic duct stenosis by means of pancreatic duct occupation.
