Title: Prevention of Rectal Stenosis After Procedure for Prolapse and Hemorrhoids by Anastomotic Thread-Drawing and Anal Enlargement.

Abstract: PURPOSE: to investigate preventive measures of rectal stricture after procedure for prolapse and hemorrhoids (PPH) and to intervene early.
METHODS: A total of 400 patients with severe mixed hemorrhoids hospitalized in the [anonymous hospital] from January 2018 to February 2022 were randomly divided into the experimental group and control group A, B, and C, with 100 patients in each group. Experimental group: Thread-drawing during operation and anal enlargement after PPH. Group A: Thread-drawing during PPH surgery, group B: Anal enlargement after PPH, and group C: PPH alone. The anastomotic sites of the 4 groups were observed for 1-2 months and followed up for 1-3Â years.
RESULTS: The effective rate of mixed hemorrhoid treatment in the 4 groups was 100%. There was no rectal stenosis in the experimental group, 11% in group A, 7% in group B, and 14% in group C.
CONCLUSION: Multipoint thread-drawing and anal enlargement after PPH can avoid postoperative rectal stenosis and can strengthen anastomosis and reduce bleeding, while being a simple procedure that can be easily popularized.
