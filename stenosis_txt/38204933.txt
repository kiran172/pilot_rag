Title: Anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm with proximal parent artery stenosis: A case report.

Abstract: Hemodynamic factors are associated with the progression of cerebral aneurysms. We report a 78-year-old woman with an anterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysm and proximal stenosis of the anterior inferior cerebellar and basilar arteries. The aneurysm exhibited growth on annual follow-up imaging. Aneurysmal rupture occurred 4 years after diagnosis. Coil embolization resulted in aneurysm occlusion with parent artery preservation. Aneurysms adjacent to a more proximal region of severe stenosis in the parent vessel should be considered at high risk for growth or rupture. Such aneurysms require careful monitoring. Particular attention should be paid to posterior circulation aneurysms that occur at anatomically vulnerable sites.
