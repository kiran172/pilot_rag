Title: High jugular bulb in patients with non-thrombotic internal jugular venous and transverse sinus stenosis: Clues to pathogenesis.

Abstract: AIMS: Conventional theories for jugular bulb (JB) formation are insufficient to explain the high proportion of high JB in adult patients. We aimed to study features of high JB in patients with non-thrombotic internal jugular venous stenosis (IJVS) and/or transverse sinus stenosis (TSS) to explore the pathogenesis of high JB formation.
METHODS: We retrospectively enrolled consecutive patients with the diagnosis of non-thrombotic IJVS and/or TSS. The relationship between IJVS and/or TSS and high JB was explored. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify potential independent risk factors for high JB.
RESULTS: A total of 228 patients were included in the final analyses. The proportions of IJVS, dominant-side IJVS, and non-TSS in dominant-side high JB subgroup were higher than those in nondominant-side high JB subgroup (83.3% vs. 62.5%, p < 0.001; 72.2% vs. 18.3%, p < 0.001; 43.5% vs. 29.2%, p = 0.02). Heights of JBs on dominant sides in IJVS subgroup and non-TSS subgroup were higher than those in non-IJVS subgroup and TSS subgroup (12.93 ± 2.57 mm vs. 11.21 ± 2.76 mm, p < 0.001; 12.66 ± 2.71 mm vs. 11.34 ± 2.73 mm, p = 0.003). Multivariate logistic regression indicated an independent association between dominant-side IJVS and dominant-side high JB (odds ratio, 29.40; 95% confidence interval, 11.04-78.30; p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: IJVS and asymmetric transverse sinus were independently and positively associated with high JB, especially dominant-side IJVS with dominant-side high JB, indicating a potential hemodynamic relationship between IJVS and high JB formation. Conversely, TTS might impede high JB formation.
